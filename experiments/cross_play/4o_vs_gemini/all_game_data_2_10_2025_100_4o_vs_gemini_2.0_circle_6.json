Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 629. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 4 + 46 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 88 x 3\n    which is 628 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 629. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Thus, securing a deal earlier in the rounds is more beneficial if the offer is advantageous.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer to evaluate, I need to consider potential counteroffers that give me more value than my outside offer of 629.\n   - Let's calculate potential divisions:\n     - Consider a scenario where I give Player 2 [2, 1, 1, 0, 2] units.\n     - This means I keep [4, 1, 2, 2, 2]:\n       - Value calculation:\n         - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 91 = 364\n         - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n         - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n         - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n         - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n       - Total value = 752\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The value of the proposed counteroffer is 752, which is greater than my outside offer of 629.\n   - Since this ensures my proposal is beneficial and avoids mistake 2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer), this is a good counteroffer to make.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I will make the following counteroffer to Player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 390. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 390. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1026 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 0 + 37 x 3 + 100 x 1 + 89 x 2 + 92 x 0\n    which is 389 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 390. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [9, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [9, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 16 x 6 + 41 x 3 + 55 x 2 + 38 x 4\n    which is 481 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 482. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 482.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 33, item 2 = 16, item 3 = 41, item 4 = 55, item 5 = 38.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 10, item 3 = 3, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 6.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that if I delay reaching an agreement, the value of any deal will be multiplied by 0.9 in round 2 and 0.81 in round 3.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\nThe current offer to me is [1, 5, 1, 2, 2]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n*   My value for this offer is: (1 * 33) + (5 * 16) + (1 * 41) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 38) = 33 + 80 + 41 + 110 + 76 = 340.\n\nComparing this to my outside offer, 340 < 482. Accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n\nI need to determine a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer for me.  Also, it's early in the negotiation (round 1), so making a counteroffer is likely better than walking away.\n\nLet's start by trying to keep a large portion of the items for myself and see if I can create a counteroffer where I give away the remaining items. \nFor example, let me see if I can propose keeping [2, 5, 2, 2, 4] for myself and offering the rest to Player 1.\n\nIf I keep [2, 5, 2, 2, 4] that means I'm offering [1, 5, 1, 2, 2] to Player 1.\nMy value for this outcome would be (2 * 33) + (5 * 16) + (2 * 41) + (2 * 55) + (4 * 38) = 66 + 80 + 82 + 110 + 152 = 490.\nSince 490 > 482, this is a better deal for me than walking away.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, and I found a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, I will make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 1 + 91 x 1 + 14 x 0 + 12 x 3 + 70 x 1\n    which is 219 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 220. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 220\n   - Item values: item 1: 22, item 2: 91, item 3: 14, item 4: 12, item 5: 70\n   - Total items: 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means any deal made in round 2 is worth 90% of the value in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of the value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 22 = 44\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 91 = 91\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 14 = 28\n      - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 12 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 70 = 70\n      - Total value of current offer: 44 + 91 + 28 + 0 + 70 = 233\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 233, which is greater than my outside offer of 220. So accepting is a viable option.\n\n3) **Evaluate potential counteroffers:**\n\n   - Before considering a counteroffer I need to think what I want to give them so I get back more than 233.\n   - If I accept the offer I get 233.\n   - If I walk I get 220.\n\n   -Let's try to construct a deal that's beneficial by taking an item that player 1 does not value or gave me all of.\n    - Looking at the current offer, Player 1 offered me all of item 2 and none of item 4. This suggests they may have a low value for item 2 and a high value for item 4.\n    - Let's assume for a moment that giving Player 1 all the units of item 2 is something they value a small amount.\n\n    - Let's construct a counteroffer where I give Player 1 all of item 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    - That would mean that I receive all other items: 5, 0, 4, 4, 2\n    - My value of the proposed split is 5 * 22 + 0 * 91 + 4 * 14 + 4 * 12 + 2 * 70 = 110 + 0 + 56 + 48 + 140 = 354\n\n   -Let's construct a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 a small amount of item 4: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n    - That would mean that I receive: 5, 1, 4, 3, 2\n    - My value of the proposed split is 5 * 22 + 1 * 91 + 4 * 14 + 3 * 12 + 2 * 70 = 110 + 91 + 56 + 36 + 140 = 433\n\n    -Let's construct a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n    - That would mean that I receive: 3, 1, 2, 3, 1\n    - My value of the proposed split is 3 * 22 + 1 * 91 + 2 * 14 + 3 * 12 + 1 * 70 = 66 + 91 + 28 + 36 + 70 = 291\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of [2, 1, 2, 0, 1] gives me a value of 233, which is greater than my outside offer of 220.\nI think Player 1 values item 4 as the other agent did not give it to me in the current offer, let me offer [2, 0, 2, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 220.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 22, item 2 = 91, item 3 = 14, item 4 = 12, item 5 = 70.\n*   The total pool of items is: 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 22 = 44\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 91 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 14 = 14\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 12 = 24\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   Total value of current offer: 44 + 0 + 14 + 24 + 70 = 152\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 152 * 0.9 = 136.8\n*   Since 136.8 is less than my outside offer of 220, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that yields a value greater than 220 for me.\n\n3) **Consider a potential counteroffer:**\n\nLet's start by calculating my current holdings, given the offer to me of [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]. This means I would keep:\n\n* Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n* Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n* Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n* Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n* Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n\nMy value would be (3 * 22) + (1 * 91) + (3 * 14) + (2 * 12) + (1 * 70) = 66 + 91 + 42 + 24 + 70 = 293\n\nLet's explore a counteroffer that benefits me. I highly value item 2, so I want to keep that. I also value item 5 quite highly. Item 1 has a relatively low value. Let's try offering Player 1 all of item 1, one unit of item 3, and two units of item 4. So, the offer to them is [5, 0, 1, 2, 0]. Then I keep:\n\n* Item 1: 5 - 5 = 0\n* Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n* Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3\n* Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n* Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n\nMy value is (0 * 22) + (1 * 91) + (3 * 14) + (2 * 12) + (2 * 70) = 0 + 91 + 42 + 24 + 140 = 297.\n\nNow let's try offering them [3, 0, 2, 2, 0]. I would keep:\n\n* Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2\n* Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n* Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n* Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n* Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n\nMy value is (2 * 22) + (1 * 91) + (2 * 14) + (2 * 12) + (2 * 70) = 44 + 91 + 28 + 24 + 140 = 327\n\nLet's try offering them [3, 0, 3, 3, 0]. I would keep:\n\n* Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2\n* Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n* Item 3: 4 - 3 = 1\n* Item 4: 4 - 3 = 1\n* Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n\nMy value is (2 * 22) + (1 * 91) + (1 * 14) + (1 * 12) + (2 * 70) = 44 + 91 + 14 + 12 + 140 = 301\n\nLet's try offering them [3, 0, 2, 3, 0]. I would keep:\n\n* Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2\n* Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n* Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n* Item 4: 4 - 3 = 1\n* Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n\nMy value is (2 * 22) + (1 * 91) + (2 * 14) + (1 * 12) + (2 * 70) = 44 + 91 + 28 + 12 + 140 = 315\n\nThese all seem better than my outside offer. Since we are in round 2, I should try to get a good offer in. The best offer for me so far is [3, 0, 2, 2, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 1 + 59 x 1 + 75 x 2 + 22 x 2 + 20 x 4\n    which is 394 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 395. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 395\n   - My values for the items: item 1 = 61, item 2 = 59, item 3 = 75, item 4 = 22, item 5 = 20\n   - Total items: 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of the same offer in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am being offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 61 = 61\n      - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 59 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 75 = 75\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 22 = 22\n      - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 20 = 40\n      - Total value of current offer: 61 + 0 + 75 + 22 + 40 = 198\n\n   - This value (198) is less than my outside offer (395). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers:\n      Since Player 1's offer is not very good for me, I should consider a counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer.\n\n      Here's one possible counteroffer: I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything.\n      My value would be:\n        - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 61 = 122\n        - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 59 = 59\n        - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 75 = 150\n        - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 22 = 66\n        - 5 units of item 5: 5 * 20 = 100\n        - Total value: 122 + 59 + 150 + 66 + 100 = 497\n\n      Since 497 is greater than my outside offer, this would be a rational offer for me to make. It might be rejected however.\n      Let's consider a slightly less greedy counteroffer, something in between the two.\n\n      Let's try offering Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 1, 3]. This means I keep:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 61 = 61\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 59 = 59\n      - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 75 = 75\n      - 2 unit of item 4: 2 * 22 = 44\n      - 2 unit of item 5: 2 * 20 = 40\n      - Total value: 61 + 59 + 75 + 44 + 40 = 279\n\n      Let's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]. This means I keep:\n      - 2 unit of item 1: 2 * 61 = 122\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 59 = 59\n      - 2 unit of item 3: 2 * 75 = 150\n      - 2 unit of item 4: 2 * 22 = 44\n      - 3 unit of item 5: 3 * 20 = 60\n      - Total value: 122 + 59 + 150 + 44 + 60 = 435\n\n      Since 435 is greater than my outside offer, this would be a rational offer for me to make. It might be rejected however.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I should not accept the current offer as it is worse than my outside offer.\n   - I should not walk away as there are potential counteroffers that would be better.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer, and also gives something of reasonable value to the other player.\n   - Given the above analysis, I'll propose to offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 1 + 59 x 1 + 75 x 2 + 22 x 2 + 20 x 4\n    which is 394 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 395. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 82 x 1 + 84 x 1 + 99 x 1 + 29 x 2\n    which is 323 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 326. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 3, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's analyze the current situation and the potential offers:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 326.\n   - My values per unit of items are: 41 (item 1), 82 (item 2), 84 (item 3), 99 (item 4), and 29 (item 5).\n   - The total pool of items is [2, 4, 1, 6, 6].\n   - The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, influences the value of waiting. Since this is round 2, the current value would be multiplied by 0.9 if we reach round 3. Thus, if an offer is below 362.22 (=326 / 0.9), it's worse than the current payoff.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer on the table: [0, 1, 0, 3, 3]\n     - My units: [2, 3, 1, 3, 3]\n     - My value for this offer: (2*41) + (3*82) + (1*84) + (3*99) + (3*29) = 82 + 246 + 84 + 297 + 87 = 796\n     - With the discount factor: 0.9 * 796 = 716.4, which is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n   - Analyze my previous offer [1, 2, 0, 3, 4]:\n     - My units: [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]\n     - Value: (1*41) + (2*82) + (1*84) + (3*99) + (2*29) = 41 + 164 + 84 + 297 + 58 = 644\n     - With discount: 0.9 * 644 = 579.6\n      \n   - Potential counteroffers:\n     Since the current offer gives me a value of 716.4, a counteroffer should exceed this value post-discount if I want to improve my standing, which might be challenging due to the high value of the current offer.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - Based on the analysis, the current offer value adjusted by the discount factor is 716.4, which is significantly higher than both my outside offer of 326 and higher than any potential counteroffer that can be effectively proposed by me under reasonable assumptions.\n   - Accepting is the best course of action because walking away or proposing a counteroffer would potentially diminish my gain.\n\nTherefore, the action to take is:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 721. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 1, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 3 + 70 x 5 + 26 x 1 + 58 x 0 + 29 x 4\n    which is 720 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 721. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1578. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1086 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [11, 3, 3, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 11 + 85 x 3 + 68 x 3 + 94 x 1 + 27 x 2\n    which is 1575 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1578. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 3, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 3, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide what action to take, let's analyze the situation and the current offer:\n\n1) Situation Analysis:\n   - My outside offer value: \\$1578\n   - My values per unit: Item 1 = \\$88, Item 2 = \\$85, Item 3 = \\$68, Item 4 = \\$94, Item 5 = \\$27\n   - Total pool of items: 11 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 3 units of Item 5\n   - Discount factor: 0.9, but currently irrelevant for first evaluation as I am looking at the immediate value.\n\n2) Assess the Offer:\n   - Current Offer (my items): [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n   - Calculate value of the current offer to me if I accept:\n     - Item 2: 3 units * \\$85 = \\$255\n     - Item 3: 3 units * \\$68 = \\$204\n     - Item 5: 3 units * \\$27 = \\$81\n     - Total value of the current offer = \\$540\n   \n   - Compare this to my outside offer value of \\$1578. The current offer is significantly lower, so I should not accept it.\n\n3) Make a Decision:\n   - The current value to me from the offer is \\$540, which is much less than my outside offer. Thus, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n   - To make a valid counteroffer, I need it to be better than my outside offer of \\$1578.\n\n   Let's attempt to craft a counteroffer where my retained value exceeds \\$1578:\n\n   Proposal: Offer Player 2 the maximum of item 2 (which seems valuable to them) while retaining more valuable items.\n   \n   - Counteroffer: [0, 3, 3, 1, 0] (offer 3 units of each item 2 and 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 of others)\n   - Retained by me: \n     - Item 1: 11 units * \\$88 = \\$968\n     - Item 4: 2 units * \\$94 = \\$188\n     - Item 5: 3 units * \\$27 = \\$81\n     - Total retained value = \\$1237\n\n   This is still below my outside offer. I could adjust further to test boundaries: \n\n   Let's try another division:\n   - Counteroffer: [0, 3, 2, 0, 1] \n   - Retained by me:\n     - Item 1: 11 units * \\$88 = \\$968\n     - Item 3: 1 unit * \\$68 = \\$68\n     - Item 4: 3 units * \\$94 = \\$282\n     - Item 5: 2 units * \\$27 = \\$54\n     - Total retained value = \\$1372\n\n   Both attempts are still below my outside offer. Let's maximize item 4 retention because it holds highest value:\n    \n   Final Counteroffer: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n   - Retained by me:\n     - Item 1: 11 units * \\$88 = \\$968\n     - Item 4: 3 units * \\$94 = \\$282\n     - Item 5: 3 units * \\$27 = \\$81\n     - Total retained value = \\$1331\n\n   I see a pattern of trying values but the items have to far exceed my outside offer for better calibration.\n\nUltimately, each counteroffer proposed remains inadequate under calculation to out-value my guaranteed fallback \\$1578, without losing too much from high-yield items. Thus, to safeguard my assured utility without undue compromises in item returns potentially devalued by further negotiation, I should choose to walk away:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 6, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 1 + 38 x 3 + 15 x 6 + 30 x 2 + 48 x 0\n    which is 359 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 362. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   4 units of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    My value from this offer would be: (0 * 95) + (1 * 38) + (4 * 15) + (0 * 30) + (1 * 48) = 0 + 38 + 60 + 0 + 48 = 146.\n    Since this is round 2, my value if I accept is 146 * 0.9^(2-1) = 146 * 0.9 = 131.4\n\nThis value (131.4) is much lower than my outside offer of 362. So, accepting is not a good idea.\n\n**Consider a potential counteroffer:**\nLet's consider an offer that would give me a value close to or exceeding my outside offer. It should be better for me than my current situation of 131.4\nI have to allocate:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 3 units\nItem 3: 6 units\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 1 unit\n\nGiven the history, the opponent doesn't seem to value item 3 a lot and is keen on item 2.\n\nLet's try to keep as many of my high-value items as possible. I'll start by keeping all of item 1 and item 5. This means offering them 0 of each. Let me also keep 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 2. This gives them 1 of item 2 and 6 of item 3:\n* Giving away [0, 1, 6, 0, 0]\n* Keeping [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]\nMy value: (1 * 95) + (2 * 38) + (0 * 15) + (2 * 30) + (1 * 48) = 95 + 76 + 0 + 60 + 48 = 279\nValue with discounting: 279 * 0.9 = 251.1\nStill less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's keep all item 4 and item 5, and try to make them happy with item 3.\n\nGive away: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nKeep: [1, 2, 6, 2, 1]\nMy value: (1 * 95) + (2 * 38) + (6 * 15) + (2 * 30) + (1 * 48) = 95 + 76 + 90 + 60 + 48 = 369\nDiscounted Value: 369 * 0.9 = 332.1\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 362.\nSo, I need to make a better counteroffer.\nLet me propose keeping all of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, all 6 units of Item 3, all 2 units of Item 4 and all of Item 5. Giving the rest: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1\nMy value: (1 * 95) + (2 * 38) + (6 * 15) + (2 * 30) + (1 * 48) = 95 + 76 + 90 + 60 + 48 = 369\n\nThis is a better outcome than my outside offer of 362.\nAdjusting for the discount factor of 0.9:\n369 * 0.9 = 332.1, it is still lower than my outside offer value 362.\n\nLet me propose keeping all of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, all 6 units of Item 3, all 2 units of Item 4 and all of Item 5. Giving the rest: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1\nMy value: (1 * 95) + (3 * 38) + (6 * 15) + (2 * 30) + (1 * 48) = 95 + 114 + 90 + 60 + 48 = 407\n\nThis is a better outcome than my outside offer of 362.\nAdjusting for the discount factor of 0.9:\n407 * 0.9 = 366.3, it is higher than my outside offer value 362.\n\nThis looks good.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible (131.4 < 362). My potential counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] has a discounted value of 366.3 which is > 362.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 429. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 4, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 1 + 87 x 1 + 32 x 4 + 85 x 2 + 1 x 1\n    which is 428 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 429. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

However, since the negotiation ends if a counteroffer is made here, my decision should be based solely on my current values, irrespective of gamma. \n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - The current offer being [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] means I'm offered nothing. Clearly, accepting this would yield 0 value to me, which is worse than my outside offer of 429.\n   - Evaluating potential counteroffers is unnecessary as making a counteroffer would be treated as a WALK in this final round. The focus should thus be on deciding between accepting the current offer and walking.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - **Current Offer Acceptance**: Accepting the current offer gives me 0 value, which is lower than my outside offer of 429. Accepting would thus constitute Mistake 4.\n   - Since any counteroffer equates to a WALK at this stage, the consideration now is whether to walk because the current offer is inferior to my outside option.\n\nGiven that the offer on the table is zero value to me, and my outside offer is considerably higher, the logical action aligned with my objectives and the rules is to walk away from the negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 507. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 498 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 0 + 63 x 4 + 1 x 2 + 51 x 3 + 33 x 3\n    which is 506 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 507. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 5, 1, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 5, 1, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n    *   My outside offer value: 507\n    *   My values for items: item 1: 18, item 2: 63, item 3: 1, item 4: 51, item 5: 33\n    *   Total items: item 1: 5, item 2: 7, item 3: 3, item 4: 3, item 5: 6\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting a deal in later rounds is worth less.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   Current offer to me: [2, 5, 1, 1, 4]\n        *   My value if I accept: 2 * 18 + 5 * 63 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 51 + 4 * 33 = 36 + 315 + 1 + 51 + 132 = 535\n    *   Since 535 > 507, accepting is better than walking away *right now*. However, making a counteroffer might be even better, especially considering the discount factor in later rounds.\n\n    Now, let's consider some potential counteroffers. I want to find a counteroffer that gives me more than 507 * 0.9 = 456.3 in the next round, or a counteroffer I am willing to accept this round. I should also consider what player 1's values *might* be given their initial offer. They offered a lot of item 2, which I value highly, so they likely value it less than I do.\n\n    If I give Player 1 all of item 2, 5 of item 1, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 6 of item 5, my value would be 0. This is a very bad offer for me.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me but still potentially acceptable to Player 1. The current offer is [2, 5, 1, 1, 4]. This means Player 1 keeps [3, 2, 2, 2, 2].\n\nI will propose giving Player 1 [3, 4, 2, 2, 4]. This means I keep [2, 3, 1, 1, 2].\nMy value: 2*18 + 3*63 + 1*1 + 1*51 + 2*33 = 36 + 189 + 1 + 51 + 66 = 343.\n\nStill not enough. I want to be above 507. Let's propose to give Player 1 [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]. This means I keep [4, 5, 3, 3, 4]. My value: 4*18 + 5*63 + 3*1 + 3*51 + 4*33 = 72 + 315 + 3 + 153 + 132 = 675. This offer is good for me.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   Accepting the current offer gives me 535.\n    *   Walking away gives me 507.\n    *   Counteroffer [1, 2, 0, 0, 2] gives me 675.\n\nTherefore, I should make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 5, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 2 + 89 x 3 + 79 x 5 + 2 x 4 + 14 x 1\n    which is 820 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 825. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 825\n   - My item values: Item 1 = 68, Item 2 = 89, Item 3 = 79, Item 4 = 2, Item 5 = 14\n   - Total items: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer later in the game is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 2, 2, 1]. This means Player 1 is giving me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n      My value for this offer: (0 * 68) + (0 * 89) + (2 * 79) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 14) = 0 + 0 + 158 + 4 + 14 = 176\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (176) is much less than my outside offer (825).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value. Let's start by considering keeping all the items and then reducing the amounts I keep until I have an offer for player 1. \n      My total value of all items: (2 * 68) + (3 * 89) + (5 * 79) + (4 * 2) + (3 * 14) = 136 + 267 + 395 + 8 + 42 = 848.\n      To avoid mistake 3, I should not offer nothing or all items.\n      Let's try to offer half the items of each category to the other player to avoid the extreme of mistake 3. That would be [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n      My value for that is:\n      (1 * 68) + (2 * 89) + (3 * 79) + (2 * 2) + (2 * 14) = 68 + 178 + 237 + 4 + 28 = 515\n      That offer isn't good enough. It's below my outside offer value. I need to think about the items with higher values to me.\n\n   Let's offer player 1: [0, 0, 4, 4, 3]\n   That would leave me with [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n   My value: (2 * 68) + (3 * 89) + (1 * 79) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 14) = 136 + 267 + 79 = 482\n   That offer isn't good enough.\n   Let's make an offer close to my outside offer, to show that I am willing to negotiate. I will offer player 1 the low value items, keeping the high value ones. I will offer [1, 1, 0, 4, 3]\n   My value: (1 * 68) + (2 * 89) + (5 * 79) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 14) = 68 + 178 + 395 = 641\n   That offer isn't good enough.\n   Let's try offering Player 1 only item 4 and item 5: [0, 0, 0, 4, 3]\n   This means I keep: [2, 3, 5, 0, 0]\n   My Value: (2 * 68) + (3 * 89) + (5 * 79) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 14) = 136 + 267 + 395 = 798\n   Still below my outside offer. \n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 3, 2] which leaves me with [2, 3, 5, 1, 1]\nMy value: (2*68) + (3*89) + (5*79) + (1*2) + (1*14) = 136 + 267 + 395 + 2 + 14 = 814\nThat's close. Not enough.\n\nLet's offer [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]. My value is [2, 3, 4, 2, 2]\n(2*68) + (3*89) + (4*79) + (2*2) + (2*14) = 136 + 267 + 316 + 4 + 28 = 751\nNot good enough.\n\nLet's offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. My value is [2, 3, 4, 3, 2]\n(2*68) + (3*89) + (4*79) + (3*2) + (2*14) = 136 + 267 + 316 + 6 + 28 = 753\nNot good enough.\n\nIt's Round 1, so the discount factor isn't too severe yet. I will make a counteroffer that is above my outside offer.\nIf I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 2, 1], my value is (2*68) + (3*89) + (5*79) + (2*2) + (2*14) = 136 + 267 + 395 + 4 + 28 = 830\nI will make that offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n   I should propose a counteroffer to try to get closer to my ideal outcome.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n    *   My outside offer value is 825.\n    *   My values for the items are: item 1 = 68, item 2 = 89, item 3 = 79, item 4 = 2, item 5 = 14.\n    *   The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n    *   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.9 times the value of the items, and in round 3, 0.9^2 times the value.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n        (0 \\* 68) + (2 \\* 89) + (2 \\* 79) + (0 \\* 2) + (0 \\* 14) = 0 + 178 + 158 + 0 + 0 = 336\n        Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 336 * 0.9 = 302.4\n    *   **Comparison to outside offer:** 302.4 is much less than my outside offer of 825. Accepting the current offer would be a mistake.\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to create a counteroffer that results in a value greater than 825 / 0.9 = 916.67 for me (before discounting).\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 the following:\n    *   Item 1: 0 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 0 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n\n    This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n\n    My value would be:\n    (2 \\* 68) + (3 \\* 89) + (5 \\* 79) + (0 \\* 2) + (0 \\* 14) = 136 + 267 + 395 + 0 + 0 = 798\n    798 < 916.67\n\n    Let's try another offer:\n    *   Item 1: 0 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n\n    This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n\n    My value would be:\n    (2 \\* 68) + (3 \\* 89) + (3 \\* 79) + (0 \\* 2) + (0 \\* 14) = 136 + 267 + 237 + 0 + 0 = 640\n    640 < 916.67\n\n    Let's try another offer:\n    *   Item 1: 0 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 0 units\n    *   Item 4: 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n\n    This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n\n    My value would be:\n    (2 \\* 68) + (3 \\* 89) + (5 \\* 79) + (4 \\* 2) + (3 \\* 14) = 136 + 267 + 395 + 8 + 42 = 848\n    848 < 916.67\n\n    This suggests I need more items. Player 1 clearly doesn't value item 4 much and seems to want item 2. Let's try offering them very little of anything.\n    * Item 1: 0\n    * Item 2: 0\n    * Item 3: 0\n    * Item 4: 0\n    * Item 5: 0\n    This gives me 848. 848 * 0.9 = 763.2, which is < 825\n\n    I think my best bet is to offer Player 1 the items they seem to not value as much, and keep what I value most. Let's go for it.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    I will propose the following counteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 4, 3]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 456. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 648 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 4, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 2 + 46 x 2 + 24 x 4 + 13 x 0 + 39 x 2\n    which is 454 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 456.

Given it is round 1, the negotiations have the maximum value as no discount is applied yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Currently, no offer is on the table.\n   - I need to decide on an initial counteroffer to Player 2. I'm looking to ensure that the value of items I keep is higher than my outside offer value of 370.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - To maximize my value, I want to keep a high-value combination of items.\n   - As an example, let's calculate if I give away [1, 1, 0, 2, 2] (offering this division to Player 2).\n\n   Now, calculate the value with what I keep:\n   - I keep 3 units of item 1, giving me 3 * 32 = 96\n   - I keep 1 unit of item 2, giving me 1 * 15 = 15\n   - I keep 1 unit of item 3, giving me 1 * 20 = 20\n   - I keep 3 units of item 4, giving me 3 * 3 = 9\n   - I keep 1 unit of item 5, giving me 1 * 61 = 61\n\n   Total value = 96 + 15 + 20 + 9 + 61 = 201, which is less than my outside offer of 370. \n\n   Since the total value is less than my outside offer, I will try another calculation until the value exceeds 370. Let's update my kept and offered items:\n   - Adjust my initial proposal to see if I can have a value above 370 by keeping more of high-value items:\n   \n   Let's try:\n   - Keep [4, 2, 1, 4, 3] and offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\n   Calculate the value:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 32 = 128\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 15 = 30\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 20 = 20\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 3 = 12\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 61 = 183\n\n   Total value = 128 + 30 + 20 + 12 + 183 = 373, which is greater than my outside offer of 370. \n\nThus, I will propose the following counteroffer to Player 2 and offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\nFinal action: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 0, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 3 + 1 x 2 + 20 x 0 + 21 x 4 + 64 x 3\n    which is 440 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 445. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 445.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 54, item 2 = 1, item 3 = 20, item 4 = 21, item 5 = 64.\n*   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now. For example, an offer worth 445 now is only worth 445 * 0.9 = 400.5 in round 2, and 445 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 360.45 in round 3.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value would be: (0 * 54) + (0 * 1) + (0 * 20) + (1 * 21) + (0 * 64) = 21.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 21 is significantly less than my outside offer of 445.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 445. Let's consider a few possibilities:\n\n    *   **Keep all items:** 4 * 54 + 2 * 1 + 1 * 20 + 5 * 21 + 3 * 64 = 216 + 2 + 20 + 105 + 192 = 535. This means I should offer them something.\n    *   Let's try offering them 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. That would mean I keep everything, and my value is 535.\n    *    Let's try offering Player 1 one unit of item 1. That would be 1 * 54 = 54 given to them. Then I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 3 of item 5 for a total value of 3 * 54 + 2 * 1 + 1 * 20 + 5 * 21 + 3 * 64 = 162 + 2 + 20 + 105 + 192 = 481.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible (21 << 445). I should definitely make a counteroffer. Offering Player 1 one unit of item 1 will yield me a value of 481, which is better than my outside offer of 445. I am going to make them a counteroffer where I give them 1 of item 1 and keep the rest. This should be better for both of us.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Thus, I should try to improve it further if I can.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\n- **Current offer** is not greater than my outside offer (32 is much less than 370), so I will not accept.\n- **Walking away** would give me a guaranteed value of 370.\n- **Counteroffer:** \n  - If I keep all items except what I previously offered, I have a value of 373.\n  - Let's attempt a better offer proposal. Offer Player 2 slightly more but within the bounds that ensure my value stays over 370.\n\nLet's propose giving:\n- 1 unit of Item 1 (as they offered me 1 last round)\n- 0 units of Item 2 (Slightly valued by them, and very low value to me)\n- 0 units of Item 3\n- 1 units of Item 4 (Low value to me)\n- 1 units of Item 5 (High value to me, but offering partial)\n\nIf I retain [3, 2, 1, 4, 2] I get:\n- Value = (3 \u00d7 32) + (2 \u00d7 15) + (1 \u00d7 20) + (4 \u00d7 3) + (2 \u00d7 61)\n- Value = 96 + 30 + 20 + 12 + 122 = 280 (Not sufficient)\n\nThus, let's revise what I give slightly to improve the value to me till above my outside offer. If I make an offering like [1, 0, 0, 3, 0], my new evaluation should be:\n- Retain [3, 2, 1, 2, 3]:\n- Value = (3 \u00d7 32) + (2 \u00d7 15) + (1 \u00d7 20) + (2 \u00d7 3) + (3 \u00d7 61)\n- Value = 96 + 30 + 20 + 6 + 183 = 335 (still not enough)\n\nLet's improve it minimally further:\n- Offer: [2, 0, 0, 4, 0] to them, keeping [2, 2, 1, 1, 3]:\n  - Value = (2 \u00d7 32) + (2 \u00d7 15) + (1 \u00d7 20) + (1 \u00d7 3) + (3 \u00d7 61)\n  - Value= 64 + 30 + 20 + 3 + 183 = 300\n\nDue to the discrepancy between achievable values and outside, we'd make the best counter-offer possible by slightly tweaking values:\n\n- **Final Counteroffer Proposal**:\n- Offer: [1, 1, 0, 4, 0], keeping [3, 1, 1, 1, 3].\n  - Value to me= (3 \u00d7 32) + (1 \u00d7 15) + (1 \u00d7 20) + (1 \u00d7 3) + (3 \u00d7 61)\n  - Value= 96 + 15 + 20 + 3 + 183 = 317\n\nHowever, given these facts still bound by prior result eventual outcomes not ensuring over fallback \u2014 the strategic best at bound despite with an adjusted counter, but likely in real terms, we'd have a hard press against competing deviations. \n\nResultantly, decision bends towards walking away due to inadequacy to hike a counter over existing outside offer certainty.\n\n### Action:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 2, 7, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 5 + 50 x 2 + 59 x 7 + 54 x 4 + 69 x 5\n    which is 1559 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1560. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 98) + (0 * 50) + (1 * 52) + (1 * 49) + (1 * 91) = 0 + 0 + 52 + 49 + 91 = 192\n    *   This is much less than my outside offer of 1670, so I should not accept.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1670. Let's start by calculating the value of keeping everything for myself:\n    *   (5 * 98) + (4 * 50) + (8 * 52) + (5 * 49) + (6 * 91) = 490 + 200 + 416 + 245 + 546 = 1897\n\n    Since the total value of all items is 1897, and my outside offer is 1670, any reasonable offer where I keep most of the items should be greater than my outside offer.\n\n    I should try to take advantage of the fact that Player 1 offered relatively small quantities. I should offer them items that I value less and keep items that I value more.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nI should not accept the current offer. I should make a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside offer. Let's try offering the other player all of item 2 and all of item 4, while also giving them some of item 3.

How about offering them just the initial offer back plus one unit of item 3 to look flexible: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]?\nThis means I keep [5, 4, 6, 4, 5].\n* My value: 5 * 98 + 4 * 50 + 6 * 52 + 4 * 49 + 5 * 91 = 490 + 200 + 312 + 196 + 455 = 1653\nToo low.\n\nI need to secure more items to pass my outside offer threshold.\nLet's try offering them only one of item 3 and one of item 4, offering [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], while keeping everything else.\nMy value = 5 * 98 + 4 * 50 + 7 * 52 + 4 * 49 + 6 * 91 = 490 + 200 + 364 + 196 + 546 = 1796\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation following the guide:\n\n1. **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1560.\n   - My private values per unit are: \n     * Item 1: 97\n     * Item 2: 50\n     * Item 3: 59\n     * Item 4: 54\n     * Item 5: 69\n   - Total pool of items:\n     * Item 1: 5 units\n     * Item 2: 4 units\n     * Item 3: 8 units\n     * Item 4: 5 units\n     * Item 5: 6 units\n   - The discount factor implies the value of accepting an offer in the current round is higher than in future rounds due to the decreasing value of delayed acceptance.\n\n2. **Value Assessment:**\n   - **Value of Current Offer:** (amount I'm being offered)\n     * Item 1: 0 units, contribution to value: 0\n     * Item 2: 0 units, contribution to value: 0\n     * Item 3: 1 unit, contribution = 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n     * Item 4: 1 unit, contribution = 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n     * Item 5: 0 units, contribution = 0\n     * Total current offer value = 59 + 54 = 113\n\n   This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1560, and hence not acceptable.\n\n3. **Decision Making:**\n   - **Accept Offer?**: No, as the value (113) < outside offer (1560).\n   - **Walk Away?**: No, I will consider a counteroffer before walking away.\n   - **Counteroffer:** I need to propose an allocation that secures me more than 1560 in value.\n\n   Let's compute the values for several potential counteroffers:\n   - If I keep all of item 1: 5 units worth 97 each gives 485 total\n   - If I keep 3 of item 2: 3 units worth 50 each gives 150 total\n   - If I keep 7 of item 3: 7 units worth 59 each gives 413 total\n   - If I keep all of item 4: 5 units worth 54 each gives 270 total\n   - If I keep 1 of item 5: 1 unit worth 69 gives 69 total\n\n   Adding these, my value would be:\n   - Total = 485 + 150 + 413 + 270 + 69 = 1387\n\n   While this total value is still less than my outside offer, some adjustments are needed. Let's try some modifications:\n\n   Let's try:\n   - Keep all 5 of Item 1\n   - Keep 4 of Item 2 (all)\n   - Keep 8 of Item 3 (all)\n   - Keep 4 of Item 4 (offer 1)\n   - Keep 5 of Item 5 (offer 1)\n\n   Recalculating my value:\n   - Item 1: 5 units = 485\n   - Item 2: 4 units = 200\n   - Item 3: 8 units = 472\n   - Item 4: 4 units = 216\n   - Item 5: 5 units = 345\n\n   My total value = 485 + 200 + 472 + 216 + 345 = 1718\n\n   This proposed counteroffer gives me 1718 in value, which is greater than my outside offer of 1560.\n\nThus, my action is to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1670. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1670. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1020 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 8, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 5 + 50 x 4 + 52 x 8 + 49 x 4 + 91 x 4\n    which is 1666 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1670. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1670\n   - Item values: Item 1: 98, Item 2: 50, Item 3: 52, Item 4: 49, Item 5: 91\n   - Total items: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] (I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5).\n     - My value if I accept: (0 * 98) + (0 * 50) + (0 * 52) + (1 * 49) + (1 * 91) = 140.\n     - This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1670.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer. Let's consider a few options, aiming for an offer that Player 1 might accept, based on their previous offers. They seem to want item 3, 4 and 5, but maybe they don't value 3 much and aren't willing to give up much of item 1 or 2.\n    \n    - **Option 1 (More for me):** Give Player 1: [1, 0, 2, 2, 2].  I keep [4, 4, 6, 3, 4]. My value: (4 * 98) + (4 * 50) + (6 * 52) + (3 * 49) + (4 * 91) = 392 + 200 + 312 + 147 + 364 = 1415. This is less than my outside offer of 1670, so I should not make this offer.\n    - **Option 2 (More for me):** Give Player 1: [0, 0, 3, 2, 2].  I keep [5, 4, 5, 3, 4]. My value: (5 * 98) + (4 * 50) + (5 * 52) + (3 * 49) + (4 * 91) = 490 + 200 + 260 + 147 + 364 = 1461. This is less than my outside offer of 1670, so I should not make this offer.\n    - **Option 3 (Closer to my outside offer):** Give Player 1: [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]. I keep [5, 4, 6, 4, 6]. My value: (5 * 98) + (4 * 50) + (6 * 52) + (4 * 49) + (6 * 91) = 490 + 200 + 312 + 196 + 546 = 1744. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is unacceptable (140 << 1670).\n   - Option 3 seems like a reasonable counteroffer, giving away some of what the other player seems to value while exceeding my outside offer value. Also, it is important to not make an offer that's less than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make counteroffer [0, 0, 2, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 711. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1122 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 1 + 76 x 2 + 86 x 3 + 53 x 4 + 71 x 0\n    which is 710 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 711. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 3, 2, 3, 4].

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 2 + 45 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 30 x 1 + 62 x 0\n    which is 38 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 40. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Any proposed division should prioritize high-value items based on my values:\n     \n     - If I take 0 units of item 1 and offer all 5 units (0 \u00d7 4 = 0)\n     - If I take 2 units of item 2 and offer 3 units (2 \u00d7 45 = 90)\n     - If I take 3 units of item 3 and offer 2 units (3 \u00d7 63 = 189)\n     - If I take 3 units of item 4 and offer 3 units (3 \u00d7 30 = 90)\n     - If I take 1 unit of item 5 and offer 0 units (1 \u00d7 62 = 62)\n\n     Total value = 0 + 90 + 189 + 90 + 62 = 431\n\n     This proposed division gives me a total value of 431, which is much higher than my outside offer of 40.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Since this proposed counteroffer results in a total value well above my outside offer, it is a strategically sound initial offer.\n\nSo, I will propose the following initial offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 3, 2, 3, 0]}\n```",

I need to construct a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer value of 840.\n\nLet's try a few potential divisions and calculate their values to me:\n\n1. **Offer [3, 1, 1, 0, 0] (giving the rest to Player 2):**\n   - My units: \n     - Item 1: 4 (since total 7, giving 3)\n     - Item 2: 1 (since total 2, giving 1)\n     - Item 3: 3 (since total 4, giving 1)\n     - Item 4: 4 (since total 4, giving 0)\n     - Item 5: 3 (since total 3, giving 0)\n   - My value:\n     - 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n     - 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n     - 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n     - 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n     - 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n   - Total value to me = 392 + 37 + 75 + 300 + 216 = 1020\n\nThis total value (1020) is greater than my outside offer of 840, so my proposed offer is indeed better than the fallback option.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that the calculated total value exceeds my outside offer, I will propose this as my initial offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 265. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 762 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 312. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 711 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 58 x 5 + 88 x 0 + 7 x 3\n    which is 311 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 312. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n    (1 * 9) + (2 * 75) + (0 * 58) + (0 * 88) + (0 * 7) = 9 + 150 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 159\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 159 < 312. Accepting this offer would be worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 312. Let's consider keeping all of items 3 and 4, and offering them to Player 1. This gives me:\n    * item 3 = 6 * 58 = 348\n    * item 4 = 3 * 88 = 264\n    * Total = 612. Then I can offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which give a value of 0.\n\n    *I'm keeping all of items 3 and 4, so the current offer would be offering the other player 0 units of items 3 and 4.*\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. I should not accept it. I need to make a counteroffer that benefits me more than my outside offer.\n\nLet's aim to secure items 3 and 4. The total number of item 1 = 3, item 2 = 4, item 3 = 6, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 4.\nI will give Player 1 all of items 1, 2, and 5.

In this case, walking away remains the optimal action unless I can determine a new balance that maximizes my item values over my outside offer under the given constraints. Proposing anything inefficient would result in walking away. Then, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 912. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 912. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 990 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 5, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 5 + 84 x 3 + 32 x 5 + 89 x 0 + 71 x 3\n    which is 895 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 912. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To navigate this negotiation strategically, let's consider the decision in a structured manner:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My guaranteed fallback is 912.\n- **Item Values to Me**:\n  - Item 1: 54\n  - Item 2: 84\n  - Item 3: 32\n  - Item 4: 89 (note, there are 0 units available)\n  - Item 5: 71\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n\n- **Discount Factor**: The impact of negotiating over multiple rounds with a discount factor of \\( \\gamma = 0.9 \\) suggests that delaying a resolution past the first round might reduce the effective value of concluding in the subsequent rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer from Player 2.\n- **Counteroffer Consideration**: \n  - I must propose a division that leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer of 912. \n\nGiven there's no offer on the table, I need to devise a counteroffer that ensures I get a value greater than 912 immediately. Proposing to keep a majority of high-value items could guarantee an acceptable outcome for me, considering Player 2's values remain unknown, and further negotiations might reduce the effective value due to the discount factor.\n\nAssuming I attempt to maximize my total value by keeping all units to the extent possible:\n- **Let\u2019s evaluate this potential allocation before formalizing an offer:**\n\n  If I choose to keep: [5 of Item 1, 3 of Item 2, 5 of Item 3, 0 of Item 4, 3 of Item 5], I offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 2.\n\n  Calculating my total value:\n  - 5 units of Item 1: \\( 5 \\times 54 = 270 \\)\n  - 3 units of Item 2: \\( 3 \\times 84 = 252 \\)\n  - 5 units of Item 3: \\( 5 \\times 32 = 160 \\)\n  - 0 units of Item 4: \\( 0 \\times 89 = 0 \\)\n  - 3 units of Item 5: \\( 3 \\times 71 = 213 \\)\n\n  **Total Value**: \\( 270 + 252 + 160 + 0 + 213 = 895 \\)\n\nSince 895 is less than my outside offer of 912, keeping this particular division of items is not acceptable. I need to tweak further to ensure above 912 value.\n\n**Revised Strategy:**\n\nTry another allocation:\n- I attempt to keep all units of items 1, 2, 3 and reducing 1 unit from higher valued item 3 or 2 for adjustment with the constraint:\n\n If I propose:\n- Keep: [5 of Item 1, 3 of Item 2, 4 of Item 3, 0 of Item 4, 3 of Item 5]\n- Offer: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n  \nMy total value becomes:\n- 5 units of Item 1: \\( 5 \\times 54 = 270 \\)\n- 3 units of Item 2: \\( 3 \\times 84 = 252 \\)\n- 4 units of Item 3: \\( 4 \\times 32 = 128 \\)\n- 0 units of Item 4: \\( 0 \\times 89 = 0 \\)\n- 3 units of Item 5: \\( 3 \\times 71 = 213 \\)\n\n**Total Value**: \\( 270 + 252 + 128 + 213 = 863 \\)\n\nAt this point, I realize I need a significantly beneficial offer to exceed a value of 912. None of my primary attempts exceeded my fallback decision value satisfactorily.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the valuation calculation results:\n- The total values of my proposed item divisions are consistently less than my fallback option.\n\nThus, I will choose to walk away, ensuring I receive at least as much value as my outside offer guarantees without undertaking subpar negotiations amidst unknown preferences.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 6, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 3 + 27 x 3 + 85 x 6 + 14 x 3 + 28 x 4\n    which is 916 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 917. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 6, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 3 + 27 x 3 + 85 x 6 + 14 x 3 + 28 x 4\n    which is 916 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 917. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 917\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 57, Item 2: 27, Item 3: 85, Item 4: 14, Item 5: 28\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of accepting it in round 1, and accepting in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times the value of accepting it in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 4, 3, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 57 = 57\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 27 = 108\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 85 = 255\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 14 = 14\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 28 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 57 + 108 + 255 + 14 + 0 = 434\n    *   Value adjusted by discount factor (0.9^(2-1) = 0.9): 434 * 0.9 = 390.6\n\n    Since 390.6 < 917, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to calculate if there is a counteroffer that is better than my outside option.\n    I currently have 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\n    Let's consider an offer where I give Player 1 'a' of item 1, 'b' of item 2, 'c' of item 3, 'd' of item 4, 'e' of item 5.\n    My value would be (4-a)*57 + (4-b)*27 + (6-c)*85 + (5-d)*14 + (4-e)*28.\n    We want to find a, b, c, d, e such that (4-a)*57 + (4-b)*27 + (6-c)*85 + (5-d)*14 + (4-e)*28 > 917 / 0.9 = 1018.89\n    My total value is 4*57 + 4*27 + 6*85 + 5*14 + 4*28 = 228 + 108 + 510 + 70 + 112 = 1028.\n\n    Since it is round 2, let's ensure that the potential offers are greater than 917/0.9 = 1018.89\n\n    Let's look at the history.\n    Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 2] in Round 1. This suggests they value item 5 and item 4 more.\n    I offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I don't care too much about item 3, which would be a good negotiating point.\n    Now Player 1 offered [1, 4, 3, 1, 0]. This suggests that they value item 2 and item 3 highly.\n\n    Let's try offering player 1 all of item 2, a lot of item 3, and some of item 4, keeping the rest. So offer Player 1 [0, 4, 5, 3, 0]\n\n    My value would be:\n    4*57 + 0*27 + 1*85 + 2*14 + 4*28 = 228 + 0 + 85 + 28 + 112 = 453\n\n    453 < 1018.89\n\n    Let's try to improve this.\n    Let's offer player 1 [0, 4, 2, 1, 0]\n    My value would be\n    4*57 + 0*27 + 4*85 + 4*14 + 4*28 = 228 + 0 + 340 + 56 + 112 = 736\n\n    736 < 1018.89\n    Looks like I can't create an acceptable offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is bad and I can't seem to create a valid counteroffer, I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value, and in round 3, it is worth 0.81 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I get all the items.\n   - My total value for all items is (3 * 22) + (2 * 12) + (4 * 50) + (5 * 67) + (2 * 25) = 66 + 24 + 200 + 335 + 50 = 675.\n   - 675 is much greater than my outside offer of 251.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 675, which is much better than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away gives me a value of 251.\n   - Since the other agent is offering me everything, they likely don't value the items as much as I do. Let's try and get an even better offer. My goal here is to offer them something such that, keeping the remainder, I get a value more than my outside offer, and they accept it.\n\nLet's consider giving them the items I value the least, like items 1 and 2, completely, and one unit of item 5.\nMy offer would be [3, 2, 0, 0, 1].\nMy remaining items would be [0, 0, 4, 5, 1]. The value would be:\n0*22 + 0*12 + 4*50 + 5*67 + 1*25 = 0 + 0 + 200 + 335 + 25 = 560.\n\nLet's consider offering them one unit each of items 1 and 2, zero of items 3, and all of items 4 and 5.\nMy offer would be [1, 1, 0, 5, 2].\nThen I keep [2, 1, 4, 0, 0]. The value would be:\n2*22 + 1*12 + 4*50 + 0*67 + 0*25 = 44 + 12 + 200 + 0 + 0 = 256.\nThis is greater than my outside offer, so it is good.\n\nI will make a counteroffer to try to secure a better deal, while ensuring I get more than my outside offer.\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 5, 2]}\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 849. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 849. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 4, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 3 + 19 x 2 + 93 x 4 + 69 x 5 + 18 x 1\n    which is 848 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 849. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 5, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 5, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 1 + 64 x 1 + 93 x 2 + 43 x 1 + 12 x 0\n    which is 298 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 299. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 299.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 5, 64, 93, 43, and 12, respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of the value of accepting it in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]. This means I get:\n      - 0 units of item 1: 0 * 5 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 64 = 64\n      - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 93 = 279\n      - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 43 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 12 = 12\n      - Total value: 0 + 64 + 279 + 0 + 12 = 355\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would keep and offer the rest to Player 1.  Since my outside offer is 299, any offer I make to Player 1 needs to leave me with a value greater than 299.  Also I need to consider that it is round 1.\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer of 355 is significantly better than my outside offer of 299.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me 355, which is greater than my outside offer of 299.\n   - Walking away gives me 299.\n   - Making a counteroffer could potentially yield a higher value, but there's also a risk of the negotiation breaking down and getting only 299.\n   - It's round 1, and the current offer is already quite good.  However, I want to see if I can get something better by countering. Player 1 is currently offering me nothing of item 1 and item 4.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 the opposite, giving them everything of item 2 and item 5, while giving nothing to them of item 1, item 3, and item 4.\nCounteroffer: [0, 2, 0, 1, 2]\nThis means that I get:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 5 = 10\n- 0 unit of item 2: 0 * 64 = 0\n- 7 units of item 3: 7 * 93 = 651\n- 0 unit of item 4: 0 * 43 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 12 = 12\nTotal value: 10 + 0 + 651 + 0 + 12 = 673\n\nThis value is extremely high.\n\nLet's go back and accept the initial offer of [0, 1, 3, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Given a gamma of 0.9, each subsequent round decreases the value. Thus, achieving a high immediate payoff is preferable to mitigate this factor.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nCurrently, there is no offer on the table, so we must consider a counteroffer that provides a value higher than my outside offer of 278.\n\n#### Calculating the Total Value for Potential Offers:\n\nLet's start by ensuring any counteroffer I make keeps my value above 278, considering full retention of some high-value items:\n\n- If I retain full high-value items initially (e.g., item 4), as a simple scenario:\n  \n  Let's assume I keep:\n  - Item 4: 5 units (worth 100 each)\n  - A couple of additional high-value items like some units of item 3 or 1.\n\n#### Example Counteroffer (keeping my value high):\n\nProposal to Player 2:\n- Offer 3 units of item 1\n- Offer 2 units of item 2\n- Offer 1 unit of item 3\n- Offer 0 units of item 4\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5\n\n**Value Retained (My Items)**:\n- Item 1: 1 unit = 66 \u00d7 1 = 66\n- Item 2: 1 unit = 65 \u00d7 1 = 65\n- Item 3: 3 units = 95 \u00d7 3 = 285\n- Item 4: 5 units = 100 \u00d7 5 = 500\n- Item 5: 2 units = 14 \u00d7 2 = 28\n\n**Total Value = 66 + 65 + 285 + 500 + 28 = 944**\n\nThis value significantly exceeds my outside offer of 278.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\n- Given the calculated division, my retained value (944) far exceeds my outside offer (278). \n- Since this offer ensures I avoid Mistake 2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer), and Mistake 1 (offering worse conditions in future rounds), it's a strategic offer.\n\nConsidering the analysis, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 3 + 65 x 1 + 95 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 14 x 1\n    which is 277 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 278. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 278\n   - Values of the items:\n     - Item 1: 66\n     - Item 2: 65\n     - Item 3: 95\n     - Item 4: 100\n     - Item 5: 14\n   - Total pool of items: [4, 3, 4, 5, 3]\n   - Discount factor: Each subsequent round reduces the effective value by a factor of 0.9\n\n2. Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     - Value: 1 * 66 = 66\n     - This is less than my outside offer of 278.\n   - Potential counteroffers:\n     I'll calculate a counteroffer where I keep more valuable items and see if it surpasses the value of my outside offer.\n\n   Let's consider keeping mostly, item 3 and 4, since they have high value:\n   Suppose I propose that Player 2 gets [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]:\n   - I keep [4, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n   - My total value: \n     - Item 1: 4 * 66 = 264\n     - Item 2: 2 * 65 = 130\n     - Item 3: 2 * 95 = 190\n     - Item 4: 3 * 100 = 300\n     - Item 5: 1 * 14 = 14\n     - Total value = 264 + 130 + 190 + 300 + 14 = 898\n\n   This value of 898 is far better than my outside offer value of 278.\n\n3. Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since the current offer from Player 2, [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], gives me only 66 in value, I should definitely not accept it.\n   - Walking away is also not ideal because my calculated counteroffer gives much more value at 898.\n   - Therefore, I should make a counteroffer that maximizes my value, ensuring that it is above the outside offer, which it is.\n\nGiven my analysis, I will propose a counteroffer that ensures my value exceeds my outside offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in round 2 yields 0.9 times its actual value to me, and in round 3, 0.9^2 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    My value from this offer would be: (0 * 65) + (1 * 100) + (2 * 78) + (2 * 77) + (2 * 15) = 0 + 100 + 156 + 154 + 30 = 440.\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 440 * 0.9 = 396. This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1100.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1100 / 0.9 = 1222.22. It's round 2, and I want to reach a beneficial agreement now, otherwise my outside option is my best option.\n    I have [4, 3, 4, 5, 3] units of items in total. Giving player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] results in me keeping [4, 3, 4, 5, 3], which has a value of (4 * 65) + (3 * 100) + (4 * 78) + (5 * 77) + (3 * 15) = 260 + 300 + 312 + 385 + 45 = 1302.

Discounted is 843.3.\n    I would need to be receiving at least 1222.22 / 0.9 = 1358.02 value in the final round.\n\n    Given the offers, Player 1 seems to not value item 1 as much. If I give them a lot of Item 1, maybe I will get item 2 back. Let me offer the player a lot of item 1 and item 5 and see if the player wants to close a deal with me.\n    Counteroffer [3, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n    This gives me: 1 * 65 + 3 * 100 + 3 * 78 + 4 * 77 + 1 * 15 = 65 + 300 + 234 + 308 + 15 = 922, discounted it is 829.8, less than my outside offer.\n\n    Let me re-evaluate my offers and the opponent's.\n    I need to get above 1100/0.9 = 1222.\n    The other player's last offer was giving me [0, 1, 2, 2, 2] = 440.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 3 + 65 x 1 + 95 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 14 x 1\n    which is 277 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 278. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

However, creating a new offer would not be fruitful as an offer better than discount-adjusted 324 seems unlikely given the constraints.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current offer provides a better value than my fallback outside offer, so it\u2019s a rational choice to accept this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that accepting an offer later will result in a lower overall value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 6, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 84) + (6 * 16) + (0 * 26) + (0 * 16) + (0 * 28) = 84 + 96 = 180\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 180 < 299. The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to make sure the counteroffer is better than my outside offer. I have:\n\n*   4 units of item 1\n*   6 units of item 2\n*   2 units of item 3\n*   3 units of item 4\n*   5 units of item 5\n\nSince player 1 is offering all the item 2 I can guess they do not value it so highly.\n\nLet's consider keeping all the items I value above 28: all item 1, all item 3 and all item 5. I can't offer 0 of any item. The total pool is 4 units of item 1, 6 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 5 of item 5. I need to give the other player at least one of each item. Let's try giving player 1: [1,1,1,1,1]. That would mean I keep [3,5,1,2,4]\n\nValue of [3,5,1,2,4] is:\n(3 * 84) + (5 * 16) + (1 * 26) + (2 * 16) + (4 * 28) = 252 + 80 + 26 + 32 + 112 = 502.\n\nThat's better than my outside offer, so let's proceed with that.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable because it's worth less than my outside offer. I will make a counteroffer.\n\nMy counteroffer to Player 1 is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    84 x 1 + 16 x 0 + 26 x 1 + 16 x 3 + 28 x 5\n    which is 298 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 299. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 299\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 84, Item 2: 16, Item 3: 26, Item 4: 16, Item 5: 28\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer (to me):** [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] - I receive 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept: (0 * 84) + (1 * 16) + (0 * 26) + (0 * 16) + (1 * 28) = 16 + 28 = 44\n    *   Discounted value if I accept: 44 * 0.9^(2-1) = 44 * 0.9 = 39.6\n    *   This is much less than my outside offer of 299. Accepting would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that leaves me with a value greater than 299 * 0.9 = 269.1 (the discounted value of my outside offer in the next round).\n\n    *   Let's consider a scenario where I keep most of the valuable items:\n        *   I keep: [4, 5, 2, 3, 4]\n        *   I offer: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n        *   My value: (4 * 84) + (5 * 16) + (2 * 26) + (3 * 16) + (4 * 28) = 336 + 80 + 52 + 48 + 112 = 628\n        *   This is a valid counteroffer.\n\n    *   Let's try to offer something different to the opponent to see if it will make the negotiation continue:\n        *   I keep: [3, 4, 1, 2, 4]\n        *   I offer: [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n        *   My value: (3 * 84) + (4 * 16) + (1 * 26) + (2 * 16) + (4 * 28) = 252 + 64 + 26 + 32 + 112 = 486\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is terrible (value is only 39.6, far below my outside offer of 299).\n*   I could walk away and get 299.\n*   I can make a counteroffer.\n\nSince it is only round 2, let me make a counteroffer such that I get a value higher than my outside offer multiplied by the discount factor.\n\nLet me make the counteroffer [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] as that gives me a value of 486, and the discounted value of my outside offer is 269.1.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 2, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 941. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 0, 7, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 6 + 71 x 3 + 6 x 0 + 78 x 7 + 30 x 3\n    which is 939 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 941. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 1, 4, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 1, 4, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n    *   My outside offer value: 941\n    *   My values for items: 15 (item 1), 71 (item 2), 6 (item 3), 78 (item 4), 30 (item 5)\n    *   Total pool of items: 6 (item 1), 3 (item 2), 1 (item 3), 7 (item 4), 3 (item 5)\n    *   Discount factor: 0.9.  This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me than offers in earlier rounds.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [3, 3, 1, 4, 3]. This means I get:\n        *   3 units of item 1\n        *   3 units of item 2\n        *   1 unit of item 3\n        *   4 units of item 4\n        *   3 units of item 5\n    *   Value of current offer: (3 * 15) + (3 * 71) + (1 * 6) + (4 * 78) + (3 * 30) = 45 + 213 + 6 + 312 + 90 = 666\n    *   Comparison to outside offer: 666 < 941. The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n3.  **Consider potential counteroffers:**  Since the current offer is bad, I should make a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while offering Player 1 enough to make them accept. I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer of 941. Let's try keeping all of items 1, 2, and 4, and none of 3 and 5. This means keeping [6, 3, 0, 7, 0].\n    *   Value of keeping [6, 3, 0, 7, 0]: (6 * 15) + (3 * 71) + (0 * 6) + (7 * 78) + (0 * 30) = 90 + 213 + 0 + 546 + 0 = 849\n    *   This value is still less than my outside offer. Let's try keeping all of items 1, 2, and 4 and one unit of item 5. This means keeping [6, 3, 0, 7, 1].\n        *   Value of keeping [6, 3, 0, 7, 1]: (6 * 15) + (3 * 71) + (0 * 6) + (7 * 78) + (1 * 30) = 90 + 213 + 0 + 546 + 30 = 879\n    *   Still less than my outside offer. Let's try keeping all of items 1, 2, and 4 and two units of item 5. This means keeping [6, 3, 0, 7, 2].\n        *   Value of keeping [6, 3, 0, 7, 2]: (6 * 15) + (3 * 71) + (0 * 6) + (7 * 78) + (2 * 30) = 90 + 213 + 0 + 546 + 60 = 909\n    *   Still less than my outside offer. Let's try keeping all of items 1, 2, and 4 and three units of item 5. This means keeping [6, 3, 0, 7, 3].\n        *   Value of keeping [6, 3, 0, 7, 3]: (6 * 15) + (3 * 71) + (0 * 6) + (7 * 78) + (3 * 30) = 90 + 213 + 0 + 546 + 90 = 939\n        *   Still less than my outside offer.\n        \n    Let's instead try keeping all units of items 1, 2, and 5 and giving Player 1 the entire unit of item 3. That is keeping [6, 3, 0, 0, 3].\n        *   Value of keeping [6, 3, 0, 0, 3]: (6 * 15) + (3 * 71) + (0 * 6) + (0 * 78) + (3 * 30) = 90 + 213 + 0 + 0 + 90 = 393\n        *   That's terrible.\n        \n    Since item 4 is my highest valued item, let's focus on getting all of that and giving Player 1 the rest. So I keep [0, 0, 0, 7, 0].\n        *   Value of keeping [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]: (0 * 15) + (0 * 71) + (0 * 6) + (7 * 78) + (0 * 30) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 546 + 0 = 546\n    \n    Let's try to calculate what I would need of item 4 to equal my outside offer: x * 78 = 941 => x = 12.06. Therefore, if I kept all of item 4 I would need 941 - 546 = 395 more value.\n    395 / 71 = 5.56. Since I only have 3 units of item 2, this will not work.\n    395 / 15 = 26.33. Since I only have 6 units of item 1, this will not work.\n    395 / 30 = 13.17. Since I only have 3 units of item 5, this will not work.\n    It seems I must keep some units of item 4 and others. I need to keep more than 7 items to be higher than 941.\n    Let's aim for roughly equal split to start the negotiation and keep as many units of items 2 and 4 as possible to increase my values.\n    Let's try offering [3, 1, 0, 3, 1]\n    If Player 1 accepts, I have [3, 2, 1, 4, 2]: \n        Value = 3 * 15 + 2 * 71 + 1 * 6 + 4 * 78 + 2 * 30 = 45 + 142 + 6 + 312 + 60 = 565\n    This is far worse than my outside option, so this won't work.\n    I should keep at least half the units, so I'm going to offer only 1 unit of item 2.\n    Let's keep everything else: [6, 2, 1, 7, 3].\n    My value is 6 * 15 + 2 * 71 + 1 * 6 + 7 * 78 + 3 * 30 = 90 + 142 + 6 + 546 + 90 = 874\n    Let's increase my offer of item 5, offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    6 * 15 + 3 * 71 + 1 * 6 + 7 * 78 + 3 * 30 = 90 + 213 + 6 + 546 + 90 = 945\n\n    I'm keeping [6, 3, 1, 7, 3] which is a total value of 945, which is greater than 941. \n    My offer is therefore [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n**Decision:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 3, 0, 7, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 6 + 71 x 3 + 6 x 0 + 78 x 7 + 30 x 3\n    which is 939 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 941. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 1, 4, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 941\n   - My item values: item 1=15, item 2=71, item 3=6, item 4=78, item 5=30\n   - Total items: 6 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]. This means I get 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n      (2 * 15) + (1 * 71) + (0 * 6) + (2 * 78) + (1 * 30) = 30 + 71 + 0 + 156 + 30 = 287\n\n   - This value (287) is much less than my outside offer of 941.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to calculate a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 941. Let's analyze the remaining items that I would have if I made a counteroffer. The current total available item pool is 6 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 3 of item 5. Player 1's offer is [2, 1, 0, 2, 1], which implies they would receive those items.\n   \n   I currently believe offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is not strategically sound, as the instructions specifically tell me to avoid making offers of no items or all items.\n   I am aiming to develop an offer that is better than my outside offer of 941. Let me try to offer Player 1 a different distribution of items: [4, 2, 1, 5, 2]. This leaves me with the quantities [2, 1, 0, 2, 1], which gives me a total value of 287 (as calculated above). This is less than my outside option, so this option is undesirable.\n\n   Now consider offering Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this case, the number of items I would keep for myself are [6, 3, 1, 7, 3], and this is worth\n   (6 * 15) + (3 * 71) + (1 * 6) + (7 * 78) + (3 * 30) = 90 + 213 + 6 + 546 + 90 = 945.\n   In this case, the total value of keeping these items is 945, which is *greater* than my outside offer of 941.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n   - The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n   - Offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] yields a total value higher than my outside offer.\n   - It is round 2, so there is still room for negotiation.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 1 + 30 x 0 + 100 x 1 + 5 x 1 + 60 x 2\n    which is 276 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 277. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Current Situation Analysis\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 277.\n\n2. **Item Values and Quantities**:\n   - Item 1: 5 units, value 51 per unit\n   - Item 2: 4 units, value 30 per unit\n   - Item 3: 3 units, value 100 per unit\n   - Item 4: 1 unit, value 5 per unit\n   - Item 5: 3 units, value 60 per unit\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items**:\n   - Total units = 5 (Item 1) + 4 (Item 2) + 3 (Item 3) + 1 (Item 4) + 3 (Item 5) = 16 units\n\n4. **Discount Factor**: Since it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't currently apply. However, it's a crucial element for rounds 2 and 3 should the negotiation extend that far.\n\n### Step 2: Assessing Offer Values\n\nI have no current offer to accept; hence, I need to formulate a potential initial offer that meets my objectives without being suboptimal.\n\n1. **Potential Counteroffer (Initial Offer)**:\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer (277) while also being reasonable for Player 2.\n\n   Let's explore an initial distribution proposal.\n\n   Consider keeping the higher value items for myself:\n   - **Keep**: 4 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 5.\n   - **Offer**: 1 unit of Item 1, 4 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5.\n\n   Calculation of my kept items:\n   - 4 units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 51 = 204\n   - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n   - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 60 = 120\n\n   Total proposed value to me = 204 + 300 + 120 = 624\n\n2. **Analyze against the Outside Offer**:\n   - My proposed offer value (624) is substantially higher than my outside offer value (277).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince my proposed offer is greater than my outside offer value and provides a strong starting point for negotiation:\n\n**Decision**: Propose a COUNTEROFFER that maximizes my value based on the items I intend to keep. \n\nHere's the specific counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Accepting an offer later means my value is multiplied by 0.9^(r-1).  So round 2 = 0.9, round 3 = 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 4, 0, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 1 unit offered, so I keep 5 - 1 = 4 units. Value = 4 * 91 = 364\n      - Item 2: 4 units offered, so I keep 4 - 4 = 0 units. Value = 0 * 87 = 0\n      - Item 3: 0 units offered, so I keep 3 - 0 = 3 units. Value = 3 * 9 = 27\n      - Item 4: 1 unit offered, so I keep 1 - 1 = 0 units. Value = 0 * 55 = 0\n      - Item 5: 1 unit offered, so I keep 3 - 1 = 2 units.

Since this is round 1, I should aim for more than 527/0.9 or 585.\n\n   Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer the other player only item 3 and item 5.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 1 + 30 x 0 + 100 x 1 + 5 x 1 + 60 x 2\n    which is 276 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 277. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of the value of an offer accepted in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of the value of an offer accepted in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [4, 0, 1, 3, 2]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n\n    My value for this offer is: (4 * 52) + (0 * 67) + (1 * 46) + (3 * 83) + (2 * 18) = 208 + 0 + 46 + 249 + 36 = 539\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer (539) is significantly less than my outside offer (865). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\nNow, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to find an offer that is better than my outside offer for me.\nSince Player 1 offered me almost half of Item 1, a little less than half of Item 4, and half of Item 5, they might not value those items as much as Items 2 and 3. I could try to take a large portion of the value in Item 4, and retain Item 2.\n\nI need to offer Player 1 something. Let's aim for an offer that gives me at least 865.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I keep [6, 1, 2, 6, 4]\nMy value would be: (6 * 52) + (1 * 67) + (2 * 46) + (6 * 83) + (4 * 18) = 312 + 67 + 92 + 498 + 72 = 1041\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of 1041 which is greater than my outside offer, so that's good.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. I should make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal. I should propose the counteroffer that gives player 1: [2, 0, 0, 1, 0].

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 27 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 24 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 9. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Here are a few calculations for potential offers to optimize my total value:\n\n- **Offer giving 1 unit of Item 2 and 1 unit of Item 5 to Player 2 (keeping the rest):**\n\n  - My units:\n    - Item 1: 2 x 76 = 152\n    - Item 2: 2 x 70 = 140\n    - Item 3: 2 x 84 = 168\n    - Item 4: 4 x 91 = 364\n    - Item 5: 3 x 55 = 165\n  - Total value: 152 + 140 + 168 + 364 + 165 = 989\n\n- **Evaluate against outside offer:** 989 is greater than 265. Thus, this offer is better than walking away with the outside offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nBased on the above analysis and valuations, I'll make a counteroffer that maximizes my value while offering some items to Player 2.

This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 58) + (1 * 57) + (0 * 39) + (0 * 47) + (1 * 77) = 57 + 77 = 134.\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer's value (134) is significantly less than my outside offer (700).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to calculate potential counteroffers to see if I can get a better deal. I need to keep in mind the total number of items available. Since my goal is to maximize my payoff, I should aim for a value higher than my outside option.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep all of item 1, item 2, item 3, item 4, and item 5, offering nothing to Player 1, i.e. Player 1 gets [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n    My value would be: (2 * 58) + (3 * 57) + (2 * 39) + (4 * 47) + (4 * 77) = 116 + 171 + 78 + 188 + 308 = 861.\nThis is a much better outcome than my outside offer. It also appears Player 1 is undervaluing Items 2 and 5 compared to me.\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer that gives them some of the higher value items from my perspective, so they are more likely to accept. I'll offer them 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\nThis means I keep 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\nMy value: (1 * 58) + (2 * 57) + (2 * 39) + (3 * 47) + (3 * 77) = 58 + 114 + 78 + 141 + 231 = 622. This is still worse than my outside offer. I need to do better.\nI will keep 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5, meaning I offer them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get the full value of 861.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible (134 << 700).\n*   Walking away would give me 700.\n*   I should make a counteroffer that gets me a better deal than 700. I will offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means I keep everything.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 265. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1128 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 70 x 1 + 84 x 1 + 91 x 0 + 55 x 2\n    which is 264 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 265. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 265. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 265. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1128 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 70 x 1 + 84 x 1 + 91 x 0 + 55 x 2\n    which is 264 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 265. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

The value in this round is as-is.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n  - My total value if I accept: \\( 76 \\times 0 + 70 \\times 0 + 84 \\times 0 + 91 \\times 0 + 55 \\times 2 = 110 \\)\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:** \n  - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 110.\n  - My outside offer is 265.\n  - The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - I aim to formulate a counteroffer such that the value I keep is greater than 265.\n\nLet's calculate a viable counteroffer justifying it based on values:\n- Suppose I want to keep both high-value items for myself, for instance, the two full units of item 3 and the two full units of item 4 (item 3: 84 per unit, item 4: 91 per unit), which are highly valuable to me:\n  - Keeping 0 units of item 1 (0 value)\n  - Keeping 0 units of item 2 (0 value)\n  - Keeping 2 units of item 3 gives me \\( 84 \\times 2 = 168 \\)\n  - Keeping 2 units of item 4 gives me \\( 91 \\times 2 = 182 \\)\n  - Keeping no units of item 5 gives 0\n  \n  So, a hypothetical offer that would work maximally better for me can be devised by giving away the lesser valued items, particularly item 5.\n  \n- A counter offer could be [2, 3, 0, 2, 0], giving them mainly of the lesser tasks they want.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nSince any offer I make needs to be better than the outside offer, and walking away gives me a guaranteed value of 265, it may serve my interest to secure that known fallback rather than risk a lower expected utility especially if Player 2 might have no such care.\n\nTherefore, the decision seems clear based on all derived assessments:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Then, the value to me is:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 29 = 0\n- 8 units of item 4 = 8 \u00d7 86 = 688\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n- Total value = 1138\n\nThis total value (1138) is very close to my outside offer value but slightly less, so I need to adjust it to make it a valid offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accept**: Not applicable as there's no offer.\n- **Walk Away**: I should reserve this for when counteroffers fail to meet my requirement.\n- **Counteroffer**: Modify to ensure payoff is greater than 1139.\n\n### Counteroffer Idea\n\nTo ensure my total value exceeds 1139, I can adjust the units as follows: \n\n- **Keep [4, 2, 0, 7, 4] and offer [0, 2, 4, 1, 0]** to Player 2. This gives me:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 29 = 0\n  - 7 units of item 4 = 7 \u00d7 86 = 602\n  - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n  - Total value = 1150, which is greater than my outside offer of 1139.\n\nMy action will be: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 4, 1, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 711. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 711. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 960 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 65 x 2 + 67 x 4 + 28 x 2 + 64 x 4\n    which is 710 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 711. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 4, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 4, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 711\n*   **Item values:** Item 1 = 96, Item 2 = 65, Item 3 = 67, Item 4 = 28, Item 5 = 64\n*   **Total items:** Item 1 = 4, Item 2 = 4, Item 3 = 4, Item 4 = 8, Item 5 = 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting later offers is slightly less valuable.\n\n2. **Assess the value of the current offer:**\nThe current offer is [0, 2, 4, 1, 0] (what Player 1 is offering to *me*). This means I would receive:\n\n*   0 units of item 1\n*   2 units of item 2\n*   4 units of item 3\n*   1 unit of item 4\n*   0 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this offer would be:\n(0 * 96) + (2 * 65) + (4 * 67) + (1 * 28) + (0 * 64) = 0 + 130 + 268 + 28 + 0 = 426\n\n3. **Compare to outside offer:**\nThe current offer's value (426) is significantly less than my outside offer (711). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake #4).\n\n4. **Consider a counteroffer:**\nI need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 711. Let's consider several options, focusing on keeping items I value highly (item 1, item 2, item 3, item 5).\nTo avoid offering nothing to the opponent, I should offer at least one unit of each item (or at least, most items)\n\nLet's start by giving the other player [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nThat would leave me with:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 7\nItem 5: 3\n\nValue:\n(3 * 96) + (3 * 65) + (3 * 67) + (7 * 28) + (3 * 64)\n288 + 195 + 201 + 196 + 192 = 1072\n\nThis is much higher than my outside offer. Let's see if we can make an offer where Player 1 gets closer to half (a \"fair\" distribution) while still remaining above our outside offer.\n\nLet's try [2,2,2,4,2] for player 1.\n\nThat would leave me with:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 2\n\nValue:\n(2 * 96) + (2 * 65) + (2 * 67) + (4 * 28) + (2 * 64)\n192 + 130 + 134 + 112 + 128 = 696\n\nThat offer is less than my outside option. Now, let's find the middle ground!\nLet's try giving them one less of item 4 and one more of item 3.\nMy counteroffer: [2,2,1,3,2]\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 2\nValue:\n(2 * 96) + (2 * 65) + (3 * 67) + (5 * 28) + (2 * 64)\n192 + 130 + 201 + 140 + 128 = 791\n\nThis is also greater than my outside offer. This seems reasonable.\n\n5. **Make a decision:**\nThe current offer is bad. The counteroffer [2,2,1,3,2] is better than my outside offer.\nThe game is at round 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

I should attempt a counteroffer to secure a better value for myself.\n\n- Let's try to develop a counteroffer that gives me a total value above 1139.\n  - I can try maximizing the high-value items for myself: keep more of Item 1 and Item 4. \n\n  For example, offering [0, 4, 4, 0, 4] would mean I keep:\n  - All 4 of Item 1: 4 x 98 = 392\n  - None of Item 2: 0 x 50 = 0\n  - None of Item 3: 0 x 29 = 0\n  - All 8 of Item 4: 8 x 86 = 688\n  - None of Item 5: 0 x 14 = 0\n  - Total value = 392 + 0 + 0 + 688 + 0 = 1080\n\nThis value is still below my outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 65 x 2 + 67 x 4 + 28 x 2 + 64 x 4\n    which is 710 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 711. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 4, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 4, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 4, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 711\n   - My item values: item 1 = 96, item 2 = 65, item 3 = 67, item 4 = 28, item 5 = 64\n   - Total items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 4, item 3 = 4, item 4 = 8, item 5 = 4\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 2, 4, 0, 4]. This means I get:\n      - item 1: 0\n      - item 2: 2\n      - item 3: 4\n      - item 4: 0\n      - item 5: 4\n\nMy value for this offer is: (0 * 96) + (2 * 65) + (4 * 67) + (0 * 28) + (4 * 64) = 0 + 130 + 268 + 0 + 256 = 654.\n\nSince it is round 2, we discount the current offer by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Discounted value = 654 * 0.9 = 588.6\n\n   - This value (588.6) is less than my outside offer (711). Therefore, accepting this is not ideal.\n\nNow let's consider some potential counteroffers, keeping in mind my outside offer. I need to make an offer that would give me a value greater than 711.\n\nIf I were to keep all items, my value is (4 * 96) + (4 * 65) + (4 * 67) + (8 * 28) + (4 * 64) = 384 + 260 + 268 + 224 + 256 = 1392.\n\nSince my outside offer is 711 and it is the second round, I need to get at least 711/0.9 = 790.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I give the other player only the items I value least, which is item 4:\nI give [0, 0, 0, 8, 0] to Player 1, and keep [4, 4, 4, 0, 4]. My value will be:\n(4 * 96) + (4 * 65) + (4 * 67) + (0 * 28) + (4 * 64) = 384 + 260 + 268 + 0 + 256 = 1168. This means that the discounted value will be 1168 * 0.9 = 1051.2. This is higher than outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer (when considering the discount).\n   - I should not accept the current offer.\n   - Walking away gives me 711.\n   - A possible counteroffer is [0, 0, 0, 8, 0], and if player 1 accepts, the discounted value will be 1168 * 0.9 = 1051.2.\n\nI will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 8, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 1 + 7 x 1 + 33 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 63 x 2\n    which is 167 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 168.

However, let's explore a counteroffer to see if we can potentially improve our outcome further. Since player 1 offered all the units of item 2 and item 5, it's possible they value those items less than I do. I could propose a counteroffer where I get more of item 4. Since I don't value item 4 that highly, I can offer more units of that item. Since I value item 3 the most, I want to keep it.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5. The value is 2*11 + 3*95 + 1*100 + 1*20 + 2*55 = 22 + 285 + 100 + 20 + 110 = 537. This means I offer the rest.\n\nCounteroffer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nThis division would give me: 2 * 11 + 3 * 95 + 1 * 100 + 1 * 20 + 2 * 55 = 22 + 285 + 100 + 20 + 110 = 537\n\nWhich is greater than my outside offer of 46. The initial offer gives me 395. The proposed counteroffer could give me 537. Since the current round is round 1, I can make a counteroffer without significant penalty given the discount factor.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is good, but I will propose a counteroffer that favors me more.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 168. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 540 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 1 + 7 x 1 + 33 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 63 x 2\n    which is 167 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 168. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, it is beneficial to settle early if the value is sufficient.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I will consider making a beneficial initial counteroffer.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\nTo maximize my value, I will consider possible divisions of items where the value to me exceeds my outside offer of 774.\n\nLet's conduct a few scenarios:\n\n- **Keep 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5**:  \n\n  Calculating my value:\n  - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 98 = 490\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n  - Total value = 936\n\nThis division gives me a value well above my outside offer of 774 without offering either too much or too little to Player 2. This proposal should prevent most common negotiation mistakes, such as making an offer worse than my outside offer or offering no items.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nBased on this analysis, I will propose a counteroffer where I offer Player 2 the remaining items:\n\n- Offering Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nThis effectively results in the following division:\n\n**Counteroffer to Player 2**: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nNow, let's proceed with the action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 297. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 0 + 50 x 2 + 9 x 0 + 98 x 2 + 11 x 0\n    which is 296 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 297. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 297.\n   - My values for the items are: Item 1 = 35, Item 2 = 50, Item 3 = 9, Item 4 = 98, Item 5 = 11.\n   - The total pool of items is: 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n   - The current offer is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means Player 1 is offering me 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - My value for the current offer is (2 * 35) + (1 * 50) + (1 * 9) + (1 * 98) + (1 * 11) = 70 + 50 + 9 + 98 + 11 = 238.\n   - This is less than my outside offer of 297.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\n   - I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 297.\n\nLet's analyze some potential counteroffers, keeping in mind my item valuations: I highly value items 2 and 4.\n\n**Counteroffer 1:** Keep all of items 2 and 4, give away all of items 3 and 5, and give away some of item 1.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 0 + 50 x 2 + 9 x 0 + 98 x 2 + 11 x 0\n    which is 296 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 297. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [5, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 297\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 35, Item 2: 50, Item 3: 9, Item 4: 98, Item 5: 11\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less than offers in earlier rounds.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [3, 1, 1, 1, 1] (what I receive).

I need to make an offer that gives me a value higher than my outside offer and is also realistic, given the previous offers. I should consider what Player 1 may value based on their offers. They seemed to not value Item 1 so much. Let's try offering them more of Item 1 and keep more of items 2 and 4 for myself. How about offering [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]?\n\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 4\n    *   Item 3: 2\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 2\n    My value for this offer is: 3 * 35 + 4 * 50 + 2 * 9 + 2 * 98 + 2 * 11 = 105 + 200 + 18 + 196 + 22 = 541.\n    This is greater than 297, so it's a viable option.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [3, 1, 1, 1, 1] is not better than my outside offer.\nWalking away would give me my outside offer value of 297.\nA counteroffer of [4, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me a value of 541 which is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\nNow consider discount factor of 0.9:\n* If I accept the current offer I get: 273 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 245.7.\n* If I make a counteroffer and it is accepted I get: 541 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 486.9.\n* If I walk away I get 297\n\nSince I can make an offer that greatly increases the potential outcome for me, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 89 x 3 + 14 x 4 + 43 x 6 + 31 x 1\n    which is 612 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 613. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means Player 1 is offering me 2 units of each item.\n    *   My value for this offer is: (2 * 58) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 23) + (2 * 52) = 116 + 142 + 48 + 46 + 104 = 456.\n    *   Since 456 is greater than my outside offer of 225, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.

The current offer of [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] to me yields a value of 456. The opposite allocation means that I give Player 1 [4-2, 7-2, 5-2, 6-2, 3-2] = [2, 5, 3, 4, 1]. The value I keep is 456 which is much more than the outside offer.\n\n    Let's explore a few possible counteroffers. I must provide what *I offer* to the other player. Keeping the same values might be ideal, considering player 1's offering is valuable to me. Let's try to improve this value even more with a counter offer.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]** (Offering Player 1 one of each item)\n        *   What I keep: [3, 6, 4, 5, 2]\n        *   My value: (3 * 58) + (6 * 71) + (4 * 24) + (5 * 23) + (2 * 52) = 174 + 426 + 96 + 115 + 104 = 915\n        *   This is better than my outside offer, and significantly better than the other player's initial allocation, giving me a higher amount of all items.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]** (Offering Player 1 nothing)\n        *   What I keep: [4, 7, 5, 6, 3]\n        *   My value: (4 * 58) + (7 * 71) + (5 * 24) + (6 * 23) + (3 * 52) = 232 + 497 + 120 + 138 + 156 = 1143\n        *   This offer is better than the outside offer.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3: [2, 3, 3, 4, 1]**\n        *   What I keep: [2, 4, 2, 2, 2]\n        *   My value: (2 * 58) + (4 * 71) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 23) + (2 * 52) = 116 + 284 + 48 + 46 + 104 = 598\n        *   This offer is better than the outside offer.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 4: [3, 5, 3, 4, 1]**\n        *   What I keep: [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n        *   My value: (1 * 58) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 23) + (2 * 52) = 58 + 142 + 48 + 46 + 104 = 398\n        *   This offer is better than the outside offer.\n\n    Based on the current situation, I want to try to maximize my earnings, the goal is to receive as much items as possible. The first counteroffer has the largest value than any other calculated counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] gives me 456.\n*   Counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] gives me 915.\n*   Counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me 1143.\n*   My outside option is 225.\n\nIt is best to propose the counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], since that yields a high value and might be acceptable to Player 1. It's also important to note that offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] might signal a lack of interest in negotiation, potentially leading the other player to walk away, which would give me the value of my outside offer (225).\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 613. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 567 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 89 x 3 + 14 x 4 + 43 x 6 + 31 x 1\n    which is 612 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 613. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

It reduces the effective value of the negotiated settlement in comparison to my outside offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer from Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]**\n     - My total value if I accept this offer (discount factor applied, round 2):\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n       - Total value = 12 + 89 + 14 + 43 + 31 = 189\n       - Discounted value = 189 \u00d7 0.9 = 170.1\n     - The value of this offer, 170.1, is significantly less than my outside offer of 613.\n   \n   - **Potential Counteroffer Analysis:**\n     - I'll explore keeping more valuable items to improve my position while trying to exceed my outside offer value after the discount is applied.\n     - Example: Let me calculate keeping [1, 3, 5, 3, 2] (offering the rest [3, 4, 0, 3, 1] to Player 2):\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n       - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 14 = 70\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n       - Total value = 12 + 267 + 70 + 129 + 62 = 540\n       - Discounted value = 540 \u00d7 0.9 = 486\n       - 486 is still less than my outside offer, so this is not an optimal counteroffer yet.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - After analyzing multiple counteroffers and comparing them against the outside offer, I will avoid making any of the mistakes by striving to propose a division that maximizes my value adjusted for the discount factor and exceeds my outside alternative.\n   - Given the current standings, continuing the negotiation to aim for a better offer would be judicious compared to simply accepting an inferior deal.\n\nI will offer a division better than my previous offers but still within reason to tempt Player 2 to accept. It will not be as ineffective as my outside value payout, but further concessions could adjust dynamics favorably in the final round. \n\nMy decision is to propose a better-optimized counteroffer. Offer [3, 4, 0, 2, 0] to Player 2. Here's the calculation:\n\n- Keeping [1, 3, 5, 4, 3]:\n  - My value: 1x12 + 3x89 + 5x14 + 4x43 + 3x31 = 12 + 267 + 70 + 172 + 93 = 614 (before discount)\n  - Discounted: 614 \u00d7 0.9 = 552.6\n\nStrategically aiming to reverse the balance toward a beneficial last round outcome.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 0, 2, 0]}",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 89 x 3 + 14 x 4 + 43 x 6 + 31 x 1\n    which is 612 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 613. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

We are considering the final round value directly.\n\n### Evaluating the Current Offer:\n\n5) **Current Offer Value:**\n   - The current offer is [1, 4, 0, 4, 0], meaning I receive:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n     - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n     - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n     - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 43 = 172\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 31 = 0\n   - Total value = 12 + 356 + 172 = 540\n\n6) **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n   - The current offer's value is 540, which is less than my outside offer value of 613.\n\n### Decision:\n\nSince the current offer gives me a value of 540, which is less than my outside offer value of 613, accepting this current offer would be a mistake as per Mistake 4 and Mistake 5.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 5, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 4 + 18 x 2 + 24 x 5 + 65 x 4 + 12 x 5\n    which is 632 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 633. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine my course of action, I will analyze the current situation based on the step-by-step questions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 633.\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 39\n  - Item 2: 18\n  - Item 3: 24\n  - Item 4: 65\n  - Item 5: 12\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, will reduce the overall value each round. Since this is round 2, the value of any deal made in this round will be multiplied by gamma^1 = 0.9.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] offered to me means:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n  - Total value = 39 + 0 + 24 + 65 + 12 = 140\n  - Adjusted by discount factor: 140 \u00d7 0.9 = 126\n  - This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 633.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - To beat my outside offer of 633:\n    - Suppose I keep [3, 2, 4, 3, 5], then offer the rest [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2:\n      - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n      - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n      - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 24 = 96\n      - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n      - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 12 = 60\n      - Total value = 117 + 36 + 96 + 195 + 60 = 504 is pre-discount\n      - Adjusted by discount factor: 504 \u00d7 0.9 = 453.6 which is less than my outside offer of 633.\n\nTherefore, I need a total offer that provides more value than 633 when considering discounting.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Accept**: The current offer gives me only 126, far below my outside offer of 633.\n- **Walk Away**: Not a good strategy as I can make a better counteroffer that aims toward my benefit.\n- **Counteroffer**: I need a practical counteroffer giving me value as follows:\n  - If I propose keeping [4, 3, 5, 4, 5] (offering remaining [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items to player 2):\n    - 4 units of item 1 = 156\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 54\n    - 5 units of item 3 = 120\n    - 4 units of item 4 = 260\n    - 5 units of item 5 = 60\n    - Total value = 650 which meets the required deal if we make it in this round alone.\n\nHowever, as a round progresses, I can simply maximize my objective directly only and propose a maximal divergence:\n\n**Optimal Counteroffer**: [0, 3, 0, 0, 6], since it will better align to my score approach meeting overestimating local context to favor keeping valuable units of mid-value items at this 0.9 steady state in Round 3.\n\nTherefore, the best strategic decision is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 6]}\n```",

This means offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 3, 0, 0, 6]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 6 of item 5. My value is: (0 * 57) + (3 * 89) + (0 * 48) + (0 * 60) + (6 * 64) = 0 + 267 + 0 + 0 + 384 = 651\n*   **Value of accepting current offer adjusted by discount factor:** 651 * 0.9^(2-1) = 651 * 0.9 = 585.9\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 651. With the discount, it gives me a value of 585.9. This is much less than my outside offer of 950. Thus, accepting is not a good idea.\n\nWalking away guarantees me 950, but it might be possible to get more with a counteroffer.\n\nLet's explore a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I need to keep items such that the sum of their values is greater than 950.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 145. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 1 + 44 x 0 + 17 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 99 x 1\n    which is 144 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 145. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]. This means I would get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value for this offer is:\n        (0 * 28) + (2 * 50) + (3 * 39) + (0 * 82) + (0 * 55) = 0 + 100 + 117 + 0 + 0 = 217\n\n    *   Since my value for the current offer (217) is much less than my outside offer (592), I should definitely not accept this offer.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that would give me a value greater than my outside offer. Let's consider keeping all the items myself, as calculated previously:\n        (3 * 28) + (4 * 50) + (3 * 39) + (2 * 82) + (1 * 55) = 84 + 200 + 117 + 164 + 55 = 620\n        This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    *   Let's consider keeping just enough items to reach above the outside offer.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer is terrible for me.\n    *   Walking away would give me 592.\n    *   I can definitely construct a counteroffer that gives me more than 592. I will make a counteroffer.  To avoid mistakes, I must make sure my value is greater than my outside offer of 592.\n\n    I'll offer Player 1 very little, but not zero to avoid Mistake 3. I will offer them only 1 unit of Item 1. This means I keep 2 unit of Item 1, 4 units of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5.\n\n    My value then becomes:\n    (2 * 28) + (4 * 50) + (3 * 39) + (2 * 82) + (1 * 55) = 56 + 200 + 117 + 164 + 55 = 592\n    Since my value equals my outside offer, I will add 0 units of item 2,0 units of item 3,0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5, so that I have a little bit more than my outside offer.\n\n    Thus, I will offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1, keeping [2, 4, 3, 2, 1] for myself. My value for my counteroffer is calculated below:\n    (2 * 28) + (4 * 50) + (3 * 39) + (2 * 82) + (1 * 55) = 56 + 200 + 117 + 164 + 55 = 592\n\n    I will keep 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5.\n    My value is\n    (3 * 28) + (4 * 50) + (3 * 39) + (2 * 82) + (1 * 55) = 84 + 200 + 117 + 164 + 55 = 620\n\n    Then, I will offer them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. But it may be considered as mistake 3. So I will offer them 1 unit of Item 1.\n    Thus, I will offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1, keeping [2, 4, 3, 2, 1] for myself. My value for my counteroffer is calculated below:\n    (2 * 28) + (4 * 50) + (3 * 39) + (2 * 82) + (1 * 55) = 56 + 200 + 117 + 164 + 55 = 592\n    Therefore, the best strategy is to walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means each round the potential value of accepting an offer reduces slightly. Accepting a good offer earlier prevents more discounting.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Currently, there is no offer on the table from the other player since I have the first move.\n   - I need to propose an initial offer that ensures my value from the deal is greater than my outside offer of 357.\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\n   - Calculating for different proposed divisions to maximize the value for myself while being better than the outside offer:\n     \n     Let's attempt to keep items that have higher values based on my valuation:\n\n     If I keep:\n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2 (85 x 2 = 170)\n     - 1 unit of item 3 (22 x 1 = 22)\n     - 2 units of item 4 (1 x 2 = 2)\n     - 4 units of item 5 (54 x 4 = 216)\n     - Total value = 170 + 22 + 2 + 216 = 410\n\n   This total is 410, which is greater than the outside offer value of 357. This potential offer retains value above my fallback and avoids reducing my outcome by excessive compromises.\n\nHere's the counteroffer:\nI offer Player 2 the items [2, 3, 6, 2, 0] which means I am keeping [0, 2, 1, 2, 4] for myself, ensuring my value is at least 410.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 6, 2, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 2 + 100 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 78 x 0\n    which is 22 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 47.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 1 + 87 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 61 x 1 + 64 x 0\n    which is 79 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 80. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 6, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 6, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision for the negotiation, I will follow the structured approach laid out in the step-by-step questions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **My outside offer value is 457.** This is the minimum threshold for any negotiation outcome.\n- **Values of the items per unit:**\n  - Item 1: 17\n  - Item 2: 43\n  - Item 3: 23\n  - Item 4: 23\n  - Item 5: 35\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - Item 1: 8 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n- **Discount factor:** This affects the value of the deal if accepted in later rounds. However, as this is the first round, the value is not yet discounted.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current offer:** None\n- **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 457.\n\n#### Calculation of possible divisions:\nGiven the constraint that my kept value should exceed 457, I will calculate the utility of a few divisions retaining the required combination:\n\n1. Let me propose to keep 8 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 myself. I will calculate the value:\n   - Value = (8 \u00d7 17) + (1 \u00d7 43) + (2 \u00d7 23) + (3 \u00d7 23) + (2 \u00d7 35)\n   - Value = 136 + 43 + 46 + 69 + 70 = 364\n\n2. Let me adjust offer to: 8 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 2 of item 5 (myself):\n   - Value = (8 \u00d7 17) + (3 \u00d7 43) + (3 \u00d7 23) + (4 \u00d7 23) + (2 \u00d7 35)\n   - Value = 136 + 129 + 69 + 92 + 70 = 496 (appropriate since above 457)\n\nAfter recalculating to secure my base value above outside offer 457 with these options, the second combination keeps my value over 457 and respects competitive negotiation leverage.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nBased on the above calculations, the second distribution gives me a value greater than my outside offer. Hence, I will offer Player 2 what I believe to be a fair distribution for my counteroffer:\n\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 2\n\nMy action will thus be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1966\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 91, Item 2: 25, Item 3: 78, Item 4: 98, Item 5: 76\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 8, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in later rounds is worth less than the same deal made in earlier rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\nThe current offer gives me [0, 0, 2, 1, 2], meaning I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This means I keep 8 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nThe total value of this offer to me is:\n(8 * 91) + (3 * 25) + (3 * 78) + (4 * 98) + (2 * 76) = 728 + 75 + 234 + 392 + 152 = 1581\n\nThe value of the current offer to me is 1581, which is less than my outside offer of 1966.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nI need to create a counteroffer that benefits me more than my outside offer. I will retain more of the highly valued items (1, 4, and 5) and offer more of the less valued items (2 and 3) to Player 1. Let's try keeping [8, 3, 5, 5, 4] and offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nMy value would be:\n91 * 8 + 25 * 3 + 78 * 5 + 98 * 5 + 76 * 4 = 728 + 75 + 390 + 490 + 304 = 1987.\n\nNow let's try offering [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This would mean I keep [8, 3, 4, 4, 4]:\n91 * 8 + 25 * 3 + 78 * 4 + 98 * 4 + 76 * 4 = 728 + 75 + 312 + 392 + 304 = 1811\n\nSince the current offer of 1581 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1966, and I need to ensure any offer I make is better than my outside offer value, I'm going to make a counteroffer. Player 1 seems to be undervaluing Item 3, 4, and 5, and not caring as much about item 1 and 2, which I value highly. I will try to exploit this by offering 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and keeping the rest.\n\nI will offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] which gives me:\n(8 * 91) + (3 * 25) + (4 * 78) + (4 * 98) + (4 * 76) = 728 + 75 + 312 + 392 + 304 = 1811\n\nThis is still less than 1966, so let's try offering less, maybe offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], giving me:\n91*8 + 25*3 + 78*5 + 98*5 + 76*4 = 728 + 75 + 390 + 490 + 304 = 1987. This is above my outside offer.\n\nHowever, there's no point in giving a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], since it's an absurd offer. I will offer Player 1 a mix of the items I value less, while keeping enough to exceed my outside offer.\n\nI will try offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep [8, 2, 5, 5, 4]\n91*8 + 25*2 + 78*5 + 98*5 + 76*4 = 728 + 50 + 390 + 490 + 304 = 1962. Still less than my outside offer of 1966.\n\nLet me try to offer one less unit of item 5 than in the current offer and instead offer one unit of item 2. Let me try offering [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This leaves me with [8, 2, 3, 4, 3].\n91*8 + 25*2 + 78*3 + 98*4 + 76*3 = 728 + 50 + 234 + 392 + 228 = 1632.\n\nLet me try offering [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].

Then I have [8, 3, 4, 5, 4].\n91*8 + 25*3 + 78*4 + 98*5 + 76*4 = 728 + 75 + 312 + 490 + 304 = 1909\n\nLet me try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].

I will then have [8, 3, 5, 5, 4]\n91*8 + 25*3 + 78*5 + 98*5 + 76*4 = 728 + 75 + 390 + 490 + 304 = 1987\n\nLet me try offering [0, 1, 1, 1, 1].

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 5, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 43 x 2 + 23 x 5 + 23 x 5 + 35 x 4\n    which is 456 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 457. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I'll analyze and calculate the values as instructed:\n\n1. **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 457.\n   - My values per unit are: Item 1 = 17, Item 2 = 43, Item 3 = 23, Item 4 = 23, Item 5 = 35.\n   - Total pool of items: Item 1 = 8, Item 2 = 3, Item 3 = 5, Item 4 = 5, Item 5 = 4.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) of 0.9 means the value of any offer I take would be multiplied by 0.9. Since this is Round 2, the overall value of the negotiation now is multiplied by 0.9 compared to if accepted in Round 1.\n\n2. **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1] means I keep 8, 3, 4, 4, 3 units respectively:**\n     - Item 1: 8 \u00d7 17 = 136\n     - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n     - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 23 = 92\n     - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 23 = 92\n     - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n     - Total value without discount: 554.

Accepting this offer yields a higher value.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 25 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 52 x 6 + 93 x 0\n    which is 312 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 313. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 9, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 3, 9, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation and decide on the best action for round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 313\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 30, Item 2: 25, Item 3: 75, Item 4: 52, Item 5: 93\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 9, Item 5: 6\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\nThe current offer to *me* is [2, 1, 3, 9, 2].

However, I should consider if a counteroffer could result in an even better outcome.\nI want to think about making a counteroffer.\n\n*   What if I offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? This means I keep [5, 3, 3, 9, 6]. This has a value to me of:\n    (5 * 30) + (3 * 25) + (3 * 75) + (9 * 52) + (6 * 93) = 150 + 75 + 225 + 468 + 558 = 1476\n    This is better than the current offer to me, however, it is not a strategic offer to make early on, and will probably result in a walk next round.\n*   Given the current offer is so generous, I can try to improve it by asking for more items that are of high value to me but of low value to Player 1.\n*   I will aim to keep items 3 and 5.\n\nLet's propose an counteroffer of [3, 2, 0, 9, 0]. This means I keep [2, 1, 3, 0, 6], with a value of:\n(2 * 30) + (1 * 25) + (3 * 75) + (0 * 52) + (6 * 93) = 60 + 25 + 225 + 0 + 558 = 868\nThis is worse than the current offer.\n\nHow about [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? Then I keep [5, 3, 3, 9, 6] = 1476. Player 1 will likely walk in response.\n\nMaybe ask for one more unit of item 5, so I keep [2, 1, 3, 9, 3]. Then I offer [3, 2, 0, 0, 3]\n(2 * 30) + (1 * 25) + (3 * 75) + (9 * 52) + (3 * 93) = 60 + 25 + 225 + 468 + 279 = 1057.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is good (964 > 313). Proposing [3, 2, 0, 0, 3] is better (1057 > 313).\nGiven that I am in round 1, making a counteroffer has more value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

Thus, it is more beneficial to secure a good deal earlier.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table.\n- **My Initial Proposal Considerations**:\n  - I must propose a division that results in a total value for me greater than 318.\n  - I can keep a substantial amount of high-value items for myself: specifically, I should aim to optimize what I keep based on the values and quantities available.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Objective**: Ensure my retained item value exceeds my outside offer of 318.\n- **Calculate Potential Counteroffer Values**:\n  - Keeping all units of Item 2 and one Item 5:  \n    - Value = (0 \u00d7 2) + (66 \u00d7 4) + (0 \u00d7 7) + (0 \u00d7 49) + (38 \u00d7 1) = 264 + 38 = 302, which is less than 318.\n  - Keeping all units of Item 2, one Item 1, and both Item 5:  \n    - Value = (2 \u00d7 1) + (66 \u00d7 4) + (0 \u00d7 7) + (0 \u00d7 49) + (38 \u00d7 2) = 2 + 264 + 76 = 342, which exceeds my outside offer.\n\nBased on these calculations, I should keep all of Item 2, one unit of Item 1, and both units of Item 5 for the maximum advantage (342), which is better than my outside alternative (318).\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 4, 0, 0]}\n```\n\nThis counteroffer implies I provide Player 2 with:\n- 2 units of Item 1\n- 0 units of Item 2\n- 4 units of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4 (none available)\n- 0 units of Item 5",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 99. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 49 x 2 + 84 x 0 + 39 x 0 + 72 x 0\n    which is 98 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 99. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 99\n    *   My values for the items: item 1 = 30, item 2 = 49, item 3 = 84, item 4 = 39, item 5 = 72\n    *   Total items: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting a deal in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 4, 0, 0].\n        This means I would get:\n        *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 30 = 60\n        *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 49 = 0\n        *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 84 = 336\n        *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 39 = 0\n        *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 72 = 0\n        *   Total value of current offer: 60 + 0 + 336 + 0 + 0 = 396\n\n    *   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 396, which is much better than my outside offer of 99.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get if I make a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while considering the other player's potential values and the discount factor. I also want to avoid making offers that are worse than my outside offer or my previous offer.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   Since the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer (396 > 99), accepting it is a strong option.\n    *   However, it's round 1, and I might be able to get a better deal by making a counteroffer. I will create a counteroffer.\n\n    To start, let's see what happens if I give Player 1 all of item 3 since I value it significantly. In the current offer Player 1 is offering me all of item 3. I think Player 1 does not highly value item 3, so maybe I can get Player 1 to give me more item 5.\n\n    Let's construct an offer where I give Player 1 4 units of item 3. This leaves me with:\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 30 = 90\n        *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 49 = 196\n        *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 84 = 0\n        *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 39 = 0\n        *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 72 = 144\n        *   Total value = 90 + 196 + 0 + 0 + 144 = 430\n\n    This is a significant improvement over the current offer. I will test an offer to Player 1 of [3, 4, 0, 0, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 0, 9] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 23 x 0 + 33 x 4 + 1 x 0 + 93 x 9\n    which is 969 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 970. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 42 x 1 + 84 x 0 + 88 x 0\n    which is 48 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 50. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 0 = 6 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n    My total value for accepting this offer would be: (3 * 27) + (2 * 74) + (3 * 35) + (6 * 21) + (0 * 100) = 81 + 148 + 105 + 126 + 0 = 460.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (460) is less than my outside offer (493). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than 493. Let's consider a potential counteroffer where I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.\nThis would mean I offer the other player: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\n\nValue = (2 * 27) + (2 * 74) + (3 * 35) + (5 * 21) + (1 * 100) = 54 + 148 + 105 + 105 + 100 = 512.\nThis offer would be good for me since 512 > 493.\n\n**Decision:** Since the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 0, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 3 + 45 x 1 + 90 x 0 + 62 x 6 + 50 x 0\n    which is 555 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 557. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, the effective value of accepting this offer is: 812 * 0.9 = 730.8\n\n2) **Outside Offer Comparison:**\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 557\n- The value of accepting the current offer (730.8) is greater than my outside offer (557).\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffers:**\nTo ensure that the counteroffer is beneficial to me, it should be greater than the current effective value of 730.8 under consideration of the discount.\n\n4) **Decision and Mistakes Based on Given Rules:**\n- Mistake 2 and Mistake 4 are to be avoided by ensuring my resulting value if I make a counteroffer is higher than 557.\n- Mistake 5 should be avoided by not rejecting an offer better than my fallback.\n\nWith these points considered, since the current effective value of the offer I am considering accepting (730.8) is significantly higher than my outside offer (557), and higher than making an unnecessary counteroffer, the best action here is to accept.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 1 + 70 x 1 + 80 x 0 + 16 x 1 + 81 x 2\n    which is 297 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 298. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action in this negotiation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 298\n*   **Item values:** Item 1 = 49, Item 2 = 70, Item 3 = 80, Item 4 = 16, Item 5 = 81\n*   **Total items:** 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\nThe current offer is [1, 1, 1, 0, 2] to *me*. This means I get:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   1 unit of item 3\n*   0 units of item 4\n*   2 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n\n(1 * 49) + (1 * 70) + (1 * 80) + (0 * 16) + (2 * 81) = 49 + 70 + 80 + 0 + 162 = 361\n\n3) **Compare to outside offer:**\n\nThe current offer's value to me (361) is greater than my outside offer (298). Therefore, accepting is better than walking away *at this moment*. However, before I accept, I should check to see if there is a better counteroffer possible.\n\n4) **Consider Counteroffers:**\n\nLet's evaluate a counteroffer. A naive offer is to split the items in half:\n* Item 1: 1.5 each\n* Item 2: 1.5 each\n* Item 3: 1 each\n* Item 4: 1.5 each\n* Item 5: 1 each\nSince we can't split items, let's see if giving all of items 1 and 4 works better than the current offer. This would look like [3, 0, 0, 3, 0] to Player 1. That means I get:\n\n*   0 units of item 1\n*   3 unit of item 2\n*   2 units of item 3\n*   0 units of item 4\n*   2 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n\n(0 * 49) + (3 * 70) + (2 * 80) + (0 * 16) + (2 * 81) = 0 + 210 + 160 + 0 + 162 = 532\n\nWow! That's a lot better.\n\n5) **Decision**\nSince this counteroffer returns 532, and the current offer only returns 361, and my outside offer returns 298, let's make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 3, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 2 + 37 x 3 + 78 x 3 + 100 x 6 + 64 x 0\n    which is 1029 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1030. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 6, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 6, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 1030\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 42, Item 2: 37, Item 3: 78, Item 4: 100, Item 5: 64\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 0\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and in round 3, it's worth 81%.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 1, 6, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 42 = 168\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 37 = 111\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 78 = 156\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 100 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 64 = 0\n    *   Total value: 168 + 111 + 156 + 0 + 0 = 435\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 435 < 1030. Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1030. I also need to consider what Player 1's values might be. Player 1 is giving me all 6 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 3. This *might* indicate they don't value item 4 highly, or they really want item 3. Let's try offering them items they seem to want and keeping the items I value.\n    * Try to give Player 1 one unit of item 3 and no units of other items (keep everything else):\n    *Value to me if Player 1 receives [0,0,1,0,0] = 4 * 42 + 3 * 37 + 2 * 78 + 6 * 100 + 0 * 64 = 168 + 111 + 156 + 600 + 0 = 1035\n    * this is only slightly better than outside offer. So it does not leave much for bargaining in later rounds.\n\n    * Let us try to offer Player 1 one unit of Item 1. and one unit of item 3:\n    *Value to me if Player 1 receives [1,0,1,0,0] = 3 * 42 + 3 * 37 + 2 * 78 + 6 * 100 + 0 * 64 = 126 + 111 + 156 + 600 + 0 = 993\n    * Value is worse than outside offer.\n\n    * Let us try to offer 0 of Item 3, all of Item 1 and no other items:\n    *Value to me if Player 1 receives [4,0,0,0,0] = 0 * 42 + 3 * 37 + 3 * 78 + 6 * 100 + 0 * 64 = 0 + 111 + 234 + 600 + 0 = 945\n    * Value is worse than outside offer.\n\n    * Let us try to offer one unit of Item 1 and one of Item 2:\n    *Value to me if Player 1 receives [1,1,0,0,0] = 3 * 42 + 2 * 37 + 3 * 78 + 6 * 100 + 0 * 64 = 126 + 74 + 234 + 600 + 0 = 1034\n    * Value is slightly better than outside offer.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I should make a counteroffer.\nI will offer Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1689. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1689. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1185 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 7, 1, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 4 + 89 x 7 + 80 x 1 + 71 x 3 + 76 x 6\n    which is 1688 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1689. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1625\n   - Item values: item 1: 35, item 2: 83, item 3: 34, item 4: 74, item 5: 68\n   - Total items: item 1: 6, item 2: 7, item 3: 1, item 4: 6, item 5: 7\n   - Discount factor: 0.9. This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 0, 3, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - Item 1: 1 unit * 35 = 35\n      - Item 2: 0 units * 83 = 0\n      - Item 3: 0 units * 34 = 0\n      - Item 4: 3 units * 74 = 222\n      - Item 5: 1 unit * 68 = 68\n      - Total value of current offer: 35 + 0 + 0 + 222 + 68 = 325. This is much less than my outside offer of 1625.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to calculate the value of keeping certain amounts of each item and offering the rest to Player 1. My goal is to get a total value greater than 1625. Since the total value of all items is 1745, simply giving away a small amount would easily be better than my outside offer. I want to make a counter offer that is better for me than accepting the current offer and possibly better than the walk away.\n\nHere's a potential counteroffer: I offer Player 1 half of what is available, rounded down, of each item.\n      - Item 1: Offer 3, keep 3. Value of kept items = 3 * 35 = 105\n      - Item 2: Offer 3, keep 4. Value of kept items = 4 * 83 = 332\n      - Item 3: Offer 0, keep 1. Value of kept items = 1 * 34 = 34\n      - Item 4: Offer 3, keep 3. Value of kept items = 3 * 74 = 222\n      - Item 5: Offer 3, keep 4. Value of kept items = 4 * 68 = 272\n      - Total value of counteroffer to me: 105 + 332 + 34 + 222 + 272 = 965. This is better than accepting current offer, but less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try keeping more items:\n\nI offer Player 1 the following, to see if I can exceed my outside offer:\n      - Item 1: Offer 1, keep 5. Value of kept items = 5 * 35 = 175\n      - Item 2: Offer 2, keep 5. Value of kept items = 5 * 83 = 415\n      - Item 3: Offer 0, keep 1.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1689. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1185 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 7, 1, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 4 + 89 x 7 + 80 x 1 + 71 x 3 + 76 x 6\n    which is 1688 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1689. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1689. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1185 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 7, 1, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 4 + 89 x 7 + 80 x 1 + 71 x 3 + 76 x 6\n    which is 1688 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1689. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

In round 3, the present value of the negotiated outcome will be multiplied by \\(0.9^{2}\\) or 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n     - Value of this offer to me: \n       - 0 \u00d7 79 (item 1) = 0\n       - 1 \u00d7 89 (item 2) = 89\n       - 0 \u00d7 80 (item 3) = 0\n       - 0 \u00d7 71 (item 4) = 0\n       - 0 \u00d7 76 (item 5) = 0\n     - Total current offer's value: 89.\n     - Adjusted for round 3 discount: 89 \u00d7 0.81 = 72.09.\n   - Compare to my outside offer of 1689. The current offer is significantly less valuable to me than my outside offer.\n\n   Potential counteroffers:\n   - When considering counteroffers, I need to ensure the total value of what I keep is greater than 1689.\n   - I'll attempt to create an offer where I keep [4, 6, 1, 3, 7]:\n     - Value of items I intend to keep:\n       - 4 \u00d7 79 = 316 (item 1)\n       - 6 \u00d7 89 = 534 (item 2)\n       - 1 \u00d7 80 = 80 (item 3)\n       - 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (item 4)\n       - 7 \u00d7 76 = 532 (item 5)\n     - Total value = 1675.\n     - Adjust for round 3 (1675 \u00d7 0.81 = 1356.75).\n   - My intended offer must exceed the discounted fallback value (1689 \u00d7 0.81 = 1368.09). Thus, I need a different offer to secure a better deal.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is significantly less than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting it is not beneficial, and neither is making a counteroffer based on 1689.\n   \n   **Action:**\n   - Since the only viable option to avoid major loss given the circumstances is to walk away, as accepting or counter-offering potentially non-beneficial offers are not advantageous.\n   \n   ```json\n   {\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n   ```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 192. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 549 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 92 x 1 + 15 x 0 + 30 x 2 + 13 x 3\n    which is 191 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 192. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 192\n   - My item values: item 1: 33, item 2: 92, item 3: 15, item 4: 30, item 5: 13\n   - Total items: item 1: 3, item 2: 4, item 3: 3, item 4: 2, item 5: 6\n   - Discount factor: 0.9. This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer: I receive [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]. This means Player 1 receives [2, 3, 1, 1, 4].\n   - My value from current offer: (1 * 33) + (1 * 92) + (2 * 15) + (1 * 30) + (2 * 13) = 33 + 92 + 30 + 30 + 26 = 211\n\n3) **Compare to Outside Offer:**\n   - The value of the current offer (211) is greater than my outside offer (192).\n\n4) **Potential Counteroffers:**\n   - I need to consider whether I can get an even *better* offer by making a counteroffer. However, it is Round 1, and rejecting the current offer means I take on the discount factor of 0.9.\n\n5) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth 211, which is greater than my outside offer of 192, accepting is a good option. Let's think about a counteroffer. To beat 211, I need to get more value.\n\nIf I keep [3,4,3,2,6], I get 650, and I offer them nothing, so I keep [0,0,0,0,0] for myself, which is 0.\n\nIf I offer them [0,0,0,0,0], I keep [3,4,3,2,6], which is 650.\nIf I offer them [1,1,1,1,1], I keep [2,3,2,1,5], which is 2*33+3*92+2*15+1*30+5*13 = 66+276+30+30+65 = 467\nIf I offer them [2,3,1,1,4], I keep [1,1,2,1,2], which is 211.\nIf I offer them [3,4,3,2,6], I keep [0,0,0,0,0], which is 0.\n\nIt's difficult to know Player 1's values, so let's stick with what gives me the best payoff right now.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n",

This means I *receive* 5 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (5 * 99) + (4 * 47) + (1 * 70) + (3 * 48) + (1 * 48) = 495 + 188 + 70 + 144 + 48 = 945\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (945) is *less* than my outside offer (946).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer (945) is worse than walking away (946).\n*   I should not accept the current offer.\n*   I need to consider a counteroffer or walking away. Since it is only round 1, let's try a counteroffer that provides me with a value higher than my outside offer. Player 1 clearly undervalues item 1, since they're giving all 5 units of it to me. I want to keep as much of item 1 as possible.\n\nLet's try to keep all of Item 1, and a good portion of the other items, but give Player 1 enough to likely be better than their outside offer. I'll try offering them the following: [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nValue of this offer to me (what I keep):\nItem 1: 5 * 99 = 495\nItem 2: 2 * 47 = 94\nItem 3: 2 * 70 = 140\nItem 4: 2 * 48 = 96\nItem 5: 1 * 48 = 48\nTotal Value: 495 + 94 + 140 + 96 + 48 = 873. Still not good enough.\n\nLet's try to keep more. Let's try offering them: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nValue of this offer to me (what I keep):\nItem 1: 5 * 99 = 495\nItem 2: 3 * 47 = 141\nItem 3: 3 * 70 = 210\nItem 4: 3 * 48 = 144\nItem 5: 2 * 48 = 96\nTotal Value: 495 + 141 + 210 + 144 + 96 = 1086\n\nOkay, 1086 is better than my outside offer of 946.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 50 x 1 + 94 x 0 + 38 x 0 + 75 x 0\n    which is 50 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 70. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 50 x 1 + 94 x 0 + 38 x 0 + 75 x 0\n    which is 50 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 70. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 4, 1, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 0, 3, 1, 2] (This is what *I* receive).\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 68) + (0 * 88) + (3 * 33) + (1 * 1) + (2 * 86) = 0 + 0 + 99 + 1 + 172 = 272\n    *   This is less than my outside offer of 329.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few options to illustrate the process. I need to calculate the value to *me* of different divisions.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer Example 1:** I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 3, 1, 2]. This means I keep:\n        *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n        *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n        *   Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3\n        *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n        *   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3\n        *   My value: (2 * 68) + (1 * 88) + (3 * 33) + (2 * 1) + (3 * 86) = 136 + 88 + 99 + 2 + 258 = 583\n\n    *   **Counteroffer Example 2:** I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything.\n        *   Item 1: 3\n        *   Item 2: 1\n        *   Item 3: 6\n        *   Item 4: 3\n        *   Item 5: 5\n        *   My value: (3 * 68) + (1 * 88) + (6 * 33) + (3 * 1) + (5 * 86) = 204 + 88 + 198 + 3 + 430 = 923\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer (value 272) is worse than my outside offer (329). Mistake 4.\n*   Walking away gives me 329.\n*   I need to consider making a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 329.\n*   The longer I wait, the more the discount factor hurts me.\n*   Counteroffer Example 2 gives me the maximum value possible. It is likely that Player 1 values item 3 less than I do.\n\nLet's try another counteroffer. I value item 5 highly.\n\n*   **Counteroffer Example 3:** I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 6, 3, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 1\n    *   Item 3: 0\n    *   Item 4: 0\n    *   Item 5: 5\n    *   My value: (3 * 68) + (1 * 88) + (0 * 33) + (0 * 1) + (5 * 86) = 204 + 88 + 0 + 0 + 430 = 722\n\nThis is also significantly better than my outside option.\n\nLet's go with Counteroffer Example 3, as it likely is better than what Player 1 expects to get given that they offered almost all of the item 3 to me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 3, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 1 + 23 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 45 x 3\n    which is 231 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 232. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 0 + 63 x 1 + 18 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 41 x 1\n    which is 104 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 106. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since my outside offer is 402, I need to ensure that the value I retain is better than or at least meets this threshold.\n\n#### Example Calculations for Possible Counteroffers\n\n- **Counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]**:\n  - Keep: 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4 \n  - Value: \\(5 \\times 75\\) + \\(6 \\times 60\\) + \\(2 \\times 95\\) + \\(5 \\times 69\\) + \\(0 \\times 50\\) = 1270\n\nThe above division gives a significantly higher value than 402, meeting the requirements.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on my calculations, I should propose a counteroffer that retains a value greater than my outside offer. The values suggest keeping all units except for the least valuable, single unit of item 5.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the following offer:\n\n- Offer all 0 units of items 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the single unit of item 5 given to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```\n\nThis offer ensures that my value is significantly above my outside offer value, making it an optimal choice at this stage.",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1.  **Current Situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 354\n    *   My values for the items: item 1 = 89, item 2 = 49, item 3 = 11, item 4 = 64, item 5 = 43\n    *   Total items: item 1 = 2, item 2 = 3, item 3 = 6, item 4 = 2, item 5 = 5\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2.  **Assess the Value of the Current Offer:**\n    The current offer gives me [1, 2, 2, 1, 3]. This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1\n    * Item 2: 3 - 2 = 1\n    * Item 3: 6 - 2 = 4\n    * Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n    * Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2\n    My value for this: (1 * 89) + (1 * 49) + (4 * 11) + (1 * 64) + (2 * 43) = 89 + 49 + 44 + 64 + 86 = 332\n\n    Since 332 < 354, accepting the current offer would be worse than my outside offer. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than 354 for me. I will explore a possible counteroffer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything.\nMy value: (2 * 89) + (3 * 49) + (6 * 11) + (2 * 64) + (5 * 43) = 178 + 147 + 66 + 128 + 215 = 734. Since 734 > 354, this is better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]. This is halfway between keeping everything and the current offer. This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1\n    * Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2\n    * Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3\n    * Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n    * Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3\nMy value for this: (1 * 89) + (2 * 49) + (3 * 11) + (1 * 64) + (3 * 43) = 89 + 98 + 33 + 64 + 129 = 413. Since 413 > 354, this is better than my outside offer.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n\n    *   The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n    *   Walking away gives me 354.\n    *   I can make a counteroffer that gives me more than 354.\n    *   Since it's round 1, there's time to negotiate, so walking away now might be premature.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, and also not too greedy so that Player 1 might consider accepting it. I'll offer [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 2, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 1 + 7 x 3 + 89 x 2 + 24 x 1 + 6 x 5\n    which is 272 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 273. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 29 x 1 + 50 x 2 + 68 x 0 + 1 x 1\n    which is 130 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 131. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 1, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action for round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 131.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 47, item 2 = 29, item 3 = 50, item 4 = 68, item 5 = 1.\n   - Total items: 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 7 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means later rounds are worth less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 2, 1, 1, 5]. This means I get:\n      - Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n      - Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n      - Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n      - Item 4: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n      - Item 5: 7 - 5 = 2 units\n      My value for this offer: (4 * 47) + (4 * 29) + (3 * 50) + (0 * 68) + (2 * 1) = 188 + 116 + 150 + 0 + 2 = 456\n      Since 456 > 131, accepting this offer would be better than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what Player 1 might value and craft a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer but also potentially attractive to Player 1. Since it is round 1 and discount factor is 0.9, I can make an offer a bit more aggressive towards me.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 456, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 131. However, it's the first round, and I want to maximize my potential gains. I will attempt to create a counteroffer that's still beneficial to me but potentially more attractive to player 1 than walking away.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 a little more of items I value less and keeping more of what I value more. I will keep 4 of Item 1 (since that is the total amount available, and it has a relatively high value for me), 4 of item 2 (2 more than their offer, and lower value), 3 of item 3 (2 more than their offer, and higher value), 0 of item 4 (1 less than their offer, and high value), and 2 of item 5 (same as their offer, and low value). This means I will offer Player 1 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\nValue to me = (4*47) + (4*29) + (3*50) + (0*68) + (2*1) = 188 + 116 + 150 + 0 + 2 = 456.\n\nLet's improve this. Try offering Player 1 more of item 3 as well. Keep 4 of Item 1 (47), 3 of item 2 (29), 2 of item 3 (50), 0 of item 4 (68), 2 of item 5 (1). Offer Player 1: 0, 3, 2, 1, 5\nValue to me = 188 + 87 + 100 + 0 + 2 = 377. This is already good. Let's see if there are improvements to make from here.\nLet's keep 4 of Item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 2 of item 5. Offer: 0, 2, 1, 1, 5.\nValue to me = 188 + 116 + 150 + 0 + 2 = 456.\nLet's keep 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 2 of item 5. Offer: 0, 3, 1, 1, 5\nValue to me = 188 + 87 + 150 + 0 + 2 = 427.\nLet's try to include item 4. Keep 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 2 of item 5. Offer: 0, 3, 1, 0, 5\nValue to me = 188 + 87 + 150 + 68 + 2 = 495\n\nNow consider offering them more of item 5, since I value it the least.\nKeep 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5. Offer: 0, 3, 1, 0, 7\nValue to me = 188 + 87 + 150 + 68 + 0 = 493.\nLet's stick with the offer: 0, 3, 1, 0, 5.\nValue to me = 495. This seems like a strong offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 0, 5]}\n```",

Thus, it's not beneficial to accept the current offer.\n\n### Counteroffer Calculation\n\nI need to propose a counteroffer that exceeds my outside value of 772 when not discounted (since the current round is 2, we apply the discount next only if proceeding to round 3):\n\nIf I keep [4, 1, 3, 1, 2] and offer [0, 5, 1, 0, 5] to Player 2:\n- Value:\n  - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n  - **Total Value:** 640\n  \nAnother iteration is necessary:\nIf I keep [4, 0, 3, 1, 0] and offer [0, 6, 1, 0, 7] (added remainder of all item quantities based on what's left):\n- Value:\n  - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 62 = 0\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 12 = 0\n  - **Total Value:** 554\n\nFor a third check:\nIf I keep [4, 0, 4, 1, 3] and offer [0, 6, 0, 0, 4]:\n- Value:\n  - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 62 = 0\n  - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 63 = 252\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n  - **Total Value:** 653 \n\nHence, when I receive [4, 0, 4, 1, 3], it is valid but not close enough. Thus, let's try increasing allocation on 1 high value item such as Item 1 and Item 4:\n\nIf I keep [3, 1, 4, 1, 3], and offer [1, 5, 0, 0, 4] to Player 2:\n- Value:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n  - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 63 = 252\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n  - **Total Value:** 628\n\nSince all attempts yield values less than 772, I'll re-assess the negotiations thus:\n\nMy own outside offer value exceeds possible constructs for a counteroffer, under rational parameters that don't trigger incompatible offers to own outside.\n\nBased on this analysis, I should keep my position solid as declines surpass benefits by walking over sub-opts.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action aligns as such:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I need to make a counteroffer that improves my value. Let's explore some options, keeping in mind I want a value greater than 1109. Also, player 1 seems to not value item 5 very much and does not value item 3 at all.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of all items:\n(4 * 54) + (2 * 81) + (4 * 69) + (4 * 65) + (5 * 52) = 216 + 162 + 276 + 260 + 260 = 1174\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5:\n(3 * 54) + (2 * 81) + (3 * 69) + (4 * 65) + (4 * 52) = 162 + 162 + 207 + 260 + 208 = 999\nThis is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 4 of item 5:\n(4 * 54) + (2 * 81) + (4 * 69) + (3 * 65) + (4 * 52) = 216 + 162 + 276 + 195 + 208 = 1057\nThis is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 3 of item 5:\n(4 * 54) + (2 * 81) + (4 * 69) + (4 * 65) + (3 * 52) = 216 + 162 + 276 + 260 + 156 = 1070\nThis is still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 5 of item 5:\n(4 * 54) + (2 * 81) + (3 * 69) + (4 * 65) + (5 * 52) = 216 + 162 + 207 + 260 + 260 = 1105\nStill a bit short.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5:\n(4 * 54) + (2 * 81) + (4 * 69) + (4 * 65) + (4 * 52) = 216 + 162 + 276 + 260 + 208 = 1122\n\nThis is finally above my outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1109. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 963 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 3, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 4 + 81 x 2 + 69 x 3 + 65 x 4 + 52 x 5\n    which is 1105 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1109. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 3, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 3, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1109.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 54, 81, 69, 65, and 52, respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 4, 2, 4, 4, and 5 units, respectively.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 3 will be worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value, compared to 0.9 in round 2, and 1 in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 3, 4].  This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 54 = 54\n      - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 81 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 69 = 69\n      - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 65 = 195\n      - 4 units of item 5: 4 * 52 = 208\n      - Total value of the current offer: 54 + 0 + 69 + 195 + 208 = 526\n   - This value of 526 is much lower than my outside offer of 1109.\n\n   - **Consider a possible counteroffer:**\n    Let's try to determine a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside offer, and that also takes into account that Player 1 might be undervaluing some of these items. Based on their offers in previous rounds, they may not be valuing item 5 highly. I currently have 5 units of item 5. Let's try to give them back 4 and keep 1. I also have all 2 units of item 2 which I value at 81 each.\n\n    I will offer Player 1 [3, 2, 3, 3, 4]. This means I keep:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 54 = 54\n      - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 81 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 69 = 69\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 65 = 65\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 52 = 52\n    - Total value: 54 + 0 + 69 + 65 + 52 = 240. This is still bad.\n    \n    Okay, let's try another approach. I want to make an offer that would give me at least 1109 now, so I will calculate my value of keeping all items:\n    4 * 54 + 2 * 81 + 4 * 69 + 4 * 65 + 5 * 52 = 216 + 162 + 276 + 260 + 260 = 1174\n\n    Since I want to keep at least 1109, and the total is 1174, I can give away a maximum of 65 in value to Player 1.\n    If I offered them 1 unit of item 4, then the value they receive is 65, and my value would be 1109.\n    Thus, I'll offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. I keep [4, 2, 4, 3, 5].\n    4*54 + 2*81 + 4*69 + 3*65 + 5*52 = 216 + 162 + 276 + 195 + 260 = 1109\n    Therefore, I'm indifferent between accepting this and walking away.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is 526, far below my outside option of 1109. I will propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If negotiations extend to further rounds, the effective value decreases due to the discount. Thus, securing a good deal early on is beneficial.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - No current offer from Player 2 is available.\n   - I need to create a counteroffer that gives me a total value greater than my outside offer, 767.\n   - I will assess the value of a potential offer by keeping a substantial portion of higher-value items while ensuring the total value exceeds 767.\n\n3) **Propose a specific counteroffer:**\n   My top priority is item 3, valued at 89 per unit. Start by maximizing the value by keeping:\n\n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 27 = 0\n   - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 74 = 0\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n   - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 43 = 215\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n\n   Total value = 635, which is lower than my outside offer. Adjust this to aim above 767, considering item 2, my second most valuable item.\n\n   Adjust offer:\n   - Keep more of item 2 and item 3:\n\n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 27 = 0\n   - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 74 = 370\n   - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n   - 1 units of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n\n   Total value = 871, which is above my outside offer.\n\n   I'll make this counteroffer by determining what to give to Player 2: \n\n   - Offer Player 2:\n     - 4 units of item 1 (all)\n     - 3 units of item 2 \n     - 1 units of item 3 \n     - 4 units of item 4 \n     - 2 units of item 5\n\nThis proposal provides me with a fair share of high-value items while potentially leaving room for negotiation with Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 1, 4, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1034. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 897 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 7, 5, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 1 + 59 x 7 + 29 x 5 + 66 x 5 + 79 x 1\n    which is 1033 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1034. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 1, 4, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 3, 1, 4, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1034. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 897 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 7, 5, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 1 + 59 x 7 + 29 x 5 + 66 x 5 + 79 x 1\n    which is 1033 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1034. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 1, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 4, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 4, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1034.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 66, item 2 = 59, item 3 = 29, item 4 = 66, item 5 = 79.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer to me: [2, 2, 2, 4, 3]. This means I receive 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - My value if I accept: (2 * 66) + (2 * 59) + (2 * 29) + (4 * 66) + (3 * 79) = 132 + 118 + 58 + 264 + 237 = 809.  Considering the discount factor, this offer is worth 809 * 0.9 = 728.1\n   - This value (728.1) is significantly less than my outside offer value of 1034.\n   - In round 1, Player 1 offered me [4,3,1,4,2] which leads to keeping [0,5,4,1,2] items. This has value\n       0*66+5*59+4*29+1*66+2*79 = 0+295+116+66+158 = 635. The discounted value is 635*0.9 = 571.5\n   - In round 2, Player 1 offered me [2,2,2,4,3] which leads to keeping [2,6,3,1,1] items. This has value\n        2*66+6*59+3*29+1*66+1*79 = 132+354+87+66+79 = 718. The discounted value is 718*0.9 = 646.2\n   - I offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] in round 1.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is worth 728.1 to me, which is less than my outside offer of 1034.\n   - Therefore, I should not accept the current offer.\n   - I also should not WALK. It's still Round 2.\n   - I need to calculate a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, accounting for the discount factor.\n   - This time, I want to propose a counteroffer. Let's say I keep [1, 7, 4, 4, 4] and offer the rest to the other party. My value would be:\n    66 x 1 + 59 x 7 + 29 x 4 + 66 x 4 + 79 x 4\n    which is 66 + 413 + 116 + 264 + 316 = 1175. Considering the discount factor, this offer is worth 1175 * 0.9 = 1057.5. Since this is better than my outside offer, it is a viable option. In this case, I offer the other player [3, 1, 1, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 0 + 59 x 1 + 81 x 1 + 1 x 2 + 16 x 5\n    which is 222 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 223. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

This means that accepting an offer later in the game is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n    *   The current offer gives me [3, 1, 2, 2, 0].\n    *   This means I get: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of this offer: (3 * 80) + (1 * 59) + (2 * 81) + (2 * 1) + (0 * 16) = 240 + 59 + 162 + 2 + 0 = 463\n    *   This value (463) is greater than my outside offer (223).\n\n3.  **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n    *   Since the current offer is better than my outside offer, I should not walk away.\n    *   I need to consider if I can make a counteroffer that gives me even more value.\n    *   To evaluate, I need to calculate the value of the items I *keep* when making a counteroffer.\n\nLet's try to find a good counteroffer. I will start by making an offer that seems favorable to me, then compare it to my outside offer. Let's try offering [1, 0, 1, 1, 3] to Player 1.

It gives me a higher value.\n\n4. **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is much better than my outside option, and it's early in the negotiation, I will make a counteroffer. The value of keeping the quantities implicit in the counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 1, 3] is 570. This is much better than the outside offer of 223.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 223. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 711 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 0 + 59 x 1 + 81 x 1 + 1 x 2 + 16 x 5\n    which is 222 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 223. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 223\n   - My values for the items: item 1: 80, item 2: 59, item 3: 81, item 4: 1, item 5: 16\n   - Total pool of items: 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - Current offer: [2, 0, 1, 1, 2] (This is what Player 1 is offering me)\n   - If I accept, I get:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 80 = 160\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 59 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 81 = 81\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 1 = 1\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 16 = 32\n     - Total value: 160 + 0 + 81 + 1 + 32 = 274\n\n3) **Compare to outside offer:**\n   - The current offer (274) is better than my outside offer (223).\n\n4) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - The current offer to me is [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would give Player 1:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - Let's consider the items they are NOT giving me: item 2 (which I value at 59) and item 5 (which I don't particularly value at 16). They are offering very little of item 1 (which I value at 80) or item 3 (which I value at 81). Since 274 > 223, it seems like making a counteroffer that gets me more of items 1 and 3 would be my best strategy.\n   - Let's try to create a counteroffer. I want to keep more of item 1 and item 3 for myself, perhaps offering them the remainder of item 5. If I offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 4], this means I am offering Player 1:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - This would leave me with\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 80 = 240\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 59 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 81 = 162\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 1 = 1\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 16 = 32\n     - Total value: 240 + 0 + 162 + 1 + 32 = 435\n\n5) **Decide on an action:**\n   - The current offer is worth 274, which is greater than my outside offer of 223.\n   - I calculated a potential counteroffer that would yield a value of 435, but it is already Round 2 and I am not sure the other player would accept.\n   - Since I am not in a position to calculate the other agent's values, and the current offer is above my outside offer, it is best for me to accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 4 + 23 x 0 + 47 x 0 + 48 x 2 + 50 x 0\n    which is 400 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 401. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 6, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 4 + 21 x 3 + 70 x 6 + 61 x 1 + 49 x 5\n    which is 977 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 987. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 220.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 26, item 2 = 34, item 3 = 29, item 4 = 92, item 5 = 54.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of what it would be worth in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 4]. This means I would have:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 26 = 26\n      - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 34 = 102\n      - 0 units of item 3: 0 * 29 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 92 = 92\n      - 4 units of item 5: 4 * 54 = 216\n      - Total value of current offer: 26 + 102 + 0 + 92 + 216 = 436\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (436) is significantly better than my outside offer (220).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is better than my outside offer. However, this is only round 1, so I may be able to get a better deal by making a counteroffer. Since the current offer is quite good, I should make a counteroffer that is still beneficial to Player 1, but gives me more.\n\nLet's calculate the value of some example counteroffers:\n\n* **Keeping most of item 4 and some of the others:** Suppose I offer [1, 2, 3, 0, 2] to Player 1. This means I keep [3, 2, 3, 2, 3].\n    * My value: 3*26 + 2*34 + 3*29 + 2*92 + 3*54 = 78 + 68 + 87 + 184 + 162 = 579\n    This is a very high value, so this could be a possible counteroffer.\n\n* **A more balanced offer:** Suppose I offer [1, 1, 2, 0, 2] to Player 1. This means I keep [3, 3, 4, 2, 3].\n    * My value: 3*26 + 3*34 + 4*29 + 2*92 + 3*54 = 78 + 102 + 116 + 184 + 162 = 642\n    This is even better!\n\nNow let's calculate the value of what Player 1 is currently offering me.  If Player 1 offered me [1, 3, 0, 1, 4], they must have kept [3, 1, 6, 1, 1].  This would be 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.  We don't know their values, so all we know is that they must prefer this current allocation to getting their outside option.\n\nSince the current offer is much better than my outside option, I shouldn't walk away. I will make the second counteroffer, as this maximizes my current value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

Let's calculate the total value:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n     - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 61 = 61\n     - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n     - Total value to me: 141 + 21 + 350 + 61 + 147 = 720\n\nThis counteroffer still does not exceed my outside offer. Let's attempt another combination for better value:\n\n   - Keeping [3, 1, 6, 2, 3] and give Player 2 [1, 3, 0, 0, 2]. Let's calculate the new total value:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n     - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 70 = 420\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n     - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n     - Total value to me: 141 + 21 + 420 + 122 + 147 = 851\n\nThis counteroffer still does not exceed my outside offer. Ensuring my outcome value aligns with my outside offer is challenging within available item constraints.\n\nGiven the challenge of making an offer that exceeds 987, depending on constraints and acceptance by the other player, it's strategic to counter with another, albeit slightly different offer within the limits. Reevaluate after this round based on remaining strategies:\n\nLet's keep focusing on item 3, offering another variation:\n\n   - Keeping [3, 3, 5, 2, 3] and give Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]. Let's calculate again:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n     - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n     - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n     - Total value to me: 141 + 63 + 350 + 122 + 147 = 923\n\nThough still not tightly achieving outside offer limit, this is close to an optimized share for immediate negotiation consideration.\n\n5) Decision: Propose the most advantageous counteroffer within constraints:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 26 for item 1, 34 for item 2, 29 for item 3, 92 for item 4, 54 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 868. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 220. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 220. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 0 + 34 x 4 + 29 x 1 + 92 x 0 + 54 x 1\n    which is 219 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 220. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 220.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 26, item 2 = 34, item 3 = 29, item 4 = 92, item 5 = 54.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 2, the current discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 26 = 26\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 34 = 34\n      - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 29 = 29\n      - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 92 = 0\n      - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 54 = 108\n      - Total value = 26 + 34 + 29 + 0 + 108 = 197\n      - Discounted value = 197 * 0.9 = 177.3\n      - This is less than my outside offer of 220.\n\n   - **Consider my previous offer:** I offered Player 1 [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]. This means I kept:\n      - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 26 = 78\n      - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 34 = 102\n      - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 29 = 116\n      - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 92 = 184\n      - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 54 = 162\n      - Total value = 78 + 102 + 116 + 184 + 162 = 642\n      - Discounted value = 642 * 0.9 = 577.8\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to make an offer that's better than my outside offer *after* discounting, and hopefully better than my previous offer to signal I'm willing to negotiate.  Item 4 is valuable to me, so I want to keep as much of that as possible. Let's try to get at least 1 unit of Item 4 in this offer to me.\n\n    If I offer [0, 2, 4, 2, 3]:\n    I would keep [4, 2, 2, 0, 2]. Value is:\n    4*26 + 2*34 + 2*29 + 0*92 + 2*54 = 104 + 68 + 58 + 0 + 108 = 338\n    Discounted value = 338 * 0.9 = 304.2. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 177.3, which is less than my outside offer of 220.\n   - Walking away gives me 220.\n   - My previous offer was relatively generous and was rejected.\n   - I will make a counteroffer with a higher value to me than my outside offer. I will offer them [0, 2, 4, 2, 3]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 4, 2, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 869. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 8, 3, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 4 + 48 x 8 + 47 x 3 + 79 x 1 + 36 x 4\n    which is 868 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 869. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, I will first analyze the current situation and calculate the value of different possible offers to me:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is valued at 869.\n   - **Values of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 30 per unit\n     - Item 2: 48 per unit\n     - Item 3: 47 per unit\n     - Item 4: 79 per unit\n     - Item 5: 36 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** [7, 8, 4, 1, 4]\n   - **Discount Factor:** As it's the first round, the discount hasn't been applied yet, so any offer has full value for me.\n\n2) **Assess Value of Offers:**\n   - Since there's no current offer from Player 2, I need to evaluate potential counteroffers.\n   - My goal is to propose a division where my retained value exceeds my outside offer of 869.\n\n3) **Calculate My Total Value for Different Proposed Divisions:**\n   - I'll consider a division where I propose offering Player 2 three units of item 1, five units of item 2, one unit of item 3, none of item 4, and two units of item 5. This way, I retain:\n     - Item 1: 4 units (value = 4 * 30 = 120)\n     - Item 2: 3 units (value = 3 * 48 = 144)\n     - Item 3: 3 units (value = 3 * 47 = 141)\n     - Item 4: 1 unit (value = 1 * 79 = 79)\n     - Item 5: 2 units (value = 2 * 36 = 72)\n   - Total retained value = 120 + 144 + 141 + 79 + 72 = 556\n\n   This proposed offer results in a retained value significantly lower than my outside offer. I should modify it to maximize my value.\n\n   **Optimal Solution:**\n   - To exceed my outside offer value, I need to maximize high-value items. Since item 4 has the highest per unit value, I should keep it. I'll also adjust the distribution to ensure my value exceeds 869.\n\nLet's try a different allocation where I keep more of the high-value items:\n   - Item 1: 4 units (value = 4 * 30 = 120)\n   - Item 2: 4 units (value = 4 * 48 = 192)\n   - Item 3: 3 units (value = 3 * 47 = 141)\n   - Item 4: 0 units (value = 0 * 79 = 0)\n   - Item 5: 4 units (value = 4 * 36 = 144)\n\nLet's compute the total retained value = 120 + 192 + 141 + 0 + 144 = 597\n\nThis division still does not exceed my outside offer. I will have to adjust again to prioritize higher valued items or lower my concessions significantly on items 2, and 3.\n\nRe-strategizing again to keep as close to maximum values:\n\n- Item 1: 3 units (value = 3 * 30 = 90)\n- Item 2: 8 units (value = 8 * 48 = 384)\n- Item 3: 3 units (value = 3 * 47 = 141)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (value = 1 * 79 = 79)\n- Item 5: 3 units (value = 3 * 36 = 108)\n\nRecalculate: 90 + 384 + 141 + 79 + 108 = 802\n\nStill unacceptable. Let's go for the minimum from items not vital, and sacrificing max high-value:\n\nOffer:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (value = 1 * 30 = 30)\n- Item 2: 2 units (value = 2 * 48 = 96)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (value = 1 * 47 = 47)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (value = 1 * 79 = 79)\n- Item 5: 3 units (value = 3 * 36 = 108)\nSum retained = 30 + 96 + 47 + 79 + 108 = 360\n\nStill less than 869 value.\n\nSince optimizing strategies is not yielding beneficial offers, in consideration of the guaranteed outside offer of 869 it's rational to start negotiating with an offer lesser for the partner, so re adjusted:\n\n [3, 3, 1, 0, 2]\n\n Ensure on next rounds or intermediate, til high-end or mid-way correct with the counterproposal, to scale greater probability end-round benefits.\n\nSo, my final offer for this round:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 1, 0, 2]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action for Player 2 in Round 2.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 1128.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 76, item 2 = 25, item 3 = 49, item 4 = 76, item 5 = 90.\n   - The total pool of items is: 7 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. Since it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any deal we make now is worth 90% of its undiscounted value.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n     - My value for this offer is: (2 * 76) + (1 * 25) + (0 * 49) + (0 * 76) + (0 * 90) = 152 + 25 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 177.\n     - The discounted value of accepting this offer in round 2 is 177 * 0.9 = 159.3\n     - This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1128. So accepting this offer is not a good idea.\n\n   - **Consider my items if I accept:** If I accept [2, 1, 0, 0, 0], I keep 5 units of item 1 (7 - 2), 7 units of item 2 (8 - 1), 4 units of item 3 (4 - 0), 1 unit of item 4 (1 - 0), and 4 units of item 5 (4 - 0). My value would be:\n     - (5 * 76) + (7 * 25) + (4 * 49) + (1 * 76) + (4 * 90) = 380 + 175 + 196 + 76 + 360 = 1187\n     - Discounted value: 1187 * 0.9 = 1068.3 which is still less than my outside offer. It is better to reject.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer (accounting for the discount factor). This means my offer to player 1 would get me more in return.\n\n   - I currently have [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] on the table. That is not a good offer as my outside offer is 1128.\n\n   - Trying to give [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]: keeping all the items\n     - (7 * 76) + (8 * 25) + (4 * 49) + (1 * 76) + (4 * 90) = 532 + 200 + 196 + 76 + 360 = 1364\n     - Discounted value: 1364 * 0.9 = 1227.6 which is greater than my outside offer. This is a good starting point.\n\n   - Trying to give [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]: keep 6 of item 1\n     - (6 * 76) + (8 * 25) + (4 * 49) + (1 * 76) + (4 * 90) = 456 + 200 + 196 + 76 + 360 = 1288\n     - Discounted value: 1288 * 0.9 = 1159.2 which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n   - Trying to give [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]: keep 7 of item 1, 7 of item 2\n     - (7 * 76) + (7 * 25) + (4 * 49) + (1 * 76) + (4 * 90) = 532 + 175 + 196 + 76 + 360 = 1339\n     - Discounted value: 1339 * 0.9 = 1205.1 which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n   - I can be more generous with item 2. The other player is undervaluing item 1 as well. If I take all of item 1, I need to compensate.\n\n   - Trying to give [1, 2, 0, 0, 1] keep [6, 6, 4, 1, 3]:\n     - (6 * 76) + (6 * 25) + (4 * 49) + (1 * 76) + (3 * 90) = 456 + 150 + 196 + 76 + 270 = 1148\n     - Discounted value: 1148 * 0.9 = 1033.2 which is less than my outside offer\n\n3. **Make a decision:**\n\n   - The current offer is terrible.\n   - Giving [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives the highest value, but will likely be rejected.\n   - Giving [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] is slightly less value, but maybe more acceptable.\n   - Giving [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] is close to the value as giving [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 one unit of item 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Given how low Player 2\u2019s offers have been, they seem highly likely to reject any substantial counteroffers.\n\n**Decision**:\nBased on this analysis, I will choose to WALK away to ensure I receive my outside offer value of 869, which is better than any offer received or counterproposal I could make given the constraints.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 12 x 4 + 30 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 79 x 0\n    which is 48 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 50. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

For now, since this is the first round, the discount factor will not yet affect the outcome.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I need to calculate a potential initial offer that ensures I retain a total value greater than my outside offer of 50.\n\nLet's devise an initial offer that maximizes my value while making it plausible for Player 2 to accept:\n\n- Suppose I offer Player 2: [0, 3, 2, 1, 5]\n  - This means I keep: [2, 3, 5, 5, 6]\n  - My value calculation:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n    - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 30 = 150\n    - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 82 = 410\n    - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 79 = 474\n  - Total value = 84 + 36 + 150 + 410 + 474 = 1154\n\nThis is clearly higher than my outside offer of 50, making it a beneficial offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 12 x 4 + 30 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 79 x 0\n    which is 48 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 50. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 2, 1, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I keep:\n- Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n- Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n- Item 3: 8 - 0 = 8 units\n- Item 4: 6 - 0 = 6 units\n- Item 5: 5 - 0 = 5 units\nMy value would be: (3 * 36) + (2 * 7) + (8 * 53) + (6 * 72) + (5 * 72) = 108 + 14 + 424 + 432 + 360 = 1338. This is way better than my outside option.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 a bit more, and see if Player 1 will accept it. I will offer [4, 3, 0, 0, 1].\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 6 - 4 = 2 units\n- Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n- Item 3: 8 - 0 = 8 units\n- Item 4: 6 - 0 = 6 units\n- Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\nMy value would be: (2 * 36) + (2 * 7) + (8 * 53) + (6 * 72) + (4 * 72) = 72 + 14 + 424 + 432 + 288 = 1230. This is still way better than my outside option.\n\nSince it is round 1, I can risk making a more aggressive offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1081. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 579 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 8, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 70 x 3 + 82 x 8 + 35 x 6 + 4 x 1\n    which is 1080 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1081. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive nothing. My value is:\n    0 * 36 + 0 * 7 + 0 * 53 + 0 * 72 + 0 * 72 = 0.

Since we're in round 3, the value is multiplied by gamma^2 = 0.81 when evaluating the acceptance of the current offer.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [6, 5, 0, 0, 0]. My value for this offer will be:\n     - item 1: 6 units x 2 = 12\n     - item 2: 5 units x 70 = 350\n     - item 3: 0 units x 82 = 0\n     - item 4: 0 units x 35 = 0\n     - item 5: 0 units x 4 = 0\n     - Total value = 12 + 350 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 362\n     - Adjusted for discount factor: 362 * 0.81 = 293.22\n\n   Comparing to my outside offer of 1081, accepting the current offer is less beneficial after considering the discount.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer gives 293.22 value, which is much worse than my guaranteed outside offer of 1081. Thus, I should not accept the current offer.\n   - Walking away will give me my outside offer value of 1081.\n   - Since it is the last round, offering a counteroffer serves no benefit because Player 2 cannot respond. Therefore, making a counteroffer would not yield a better result than walking away.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best course of action that maximizes my outcome is to walk away, securing a value of 1081 from my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 629. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 1, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 99 x 4 + 13 x 1 + 36 x 3 + 37 x 3\n    which is 628 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 629. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 629. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 1, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 99 x 4 + 13 x 1 + 36 x 3 + 37 x 3\n    which is 628 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 629. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's adjust again.\n\n    - Offering: [0, 6, 0, 1, 1]\n    - This means I keep: [0, 1, 3, 2, 3]\n      - Value = 0 \u00d7 9 + 1 \u00d7 99 + 3 \u00d7 13 + 2 \u00d7 36 + 3 \u00d7 37\n      - Value = 99 + 39 + 72 + 111 = 321 (Not enough).\n    \n    More balanced counteroffer:\n   - Offering: [0, 5, 1, 1, 0]\n   - This means I keep: [0, 2, 2, 2, 4]\n     - Value = 0 \u00d7 9 + 2 \u00d7 99 + 2 \u00d7 13 + 2 \u00d7 36 + 4 \u00d7 37\n     - Value = 198 (Item 2) + 26 (Item 3) + 72 (Item 4) + 148 (Item 5) = 444, which is again not higher than the outside offer.\n\nLet's propose one final possible offer:\n   - Offering: [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n   - Keeping: [0, 4, 3, 2, 2]\n     - Value = 0 \u00d7 9 + 4 \u00d7 99 + 3 \u00d7 13 + 2 \u00d7 36 + 2 \u00d7 37\n     - Value = 396 + 39 + 72 + 74 = 581 (Not beneficial).\n\nThis does not exceed my outside offer. Given these considerations, **I should walk away from this negotiation because I cannot construct an offer where my value exceeds 629, and accepting the current offer is also less than the outside offer**.\n\n3) **Decision**:\n   - The current offer valued after discount is less than my outside offer.\n   - Counteroffers didn't exceed the outside offer.\n   - Therefore, the best choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]. This means they keep [2, 4, 5, 3, 2].\n    *   My value if I accept: (2 * 41) + (1 * 80) + (1 * 98) + (2 * 74) + (3 * 6) = 82 + 80 + 98 + 148 + 18 = 426\n    *   Since 426 > 27 (my outside offer), accepting the current offer is better than walking away *at this round*.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider what would be involved with making a counteroffer to evaluate if it's worth doing.\n\n    To make a good counteroffer, I want to maximize my gain. That means keeping the items I value the most, and giving the items I value the least to Player 1.\n\n    I value item 3 the most (98), then item 2 (80), item 4 (74), item 1 (41), and item 5 the least (6).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 426. This is significantly higher than my outside offer of 27. Since it's only round 1, accepting seems like a good option, especially considering the discount factor in future rounds. While I could try to get a better deal with a counteroffer, it may not be worth the risk of Player 1 walking away.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 394\n   - Item values: item 1 = 80, item 2 = 24, item 3 = 98, item 4 = 36, item 5 = 51\n   - Total items: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 2, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 8\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: [2, 0, 0, 2, 3] (what I receive). This means Player 1 offered me 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n   - Value of current offer: (2 * 80) + (0 * 24) + (0 * 98) + (2 * 36) + (3 * 51) = 160 + 0 + 0 + 72 + 153 = 385\n\n   - Comparison to outside offer: 385 < 394.  Accepting this offer would be worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\n   I need to create a counteroffer that gives Player 1 some items, but leaves me with a value greater than 394. The total pool of items is 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 8 of item 5.\n\n   Let's start by calculating the total value of all items to me: (3 * 80) + (2 * 24) + (2 * 98) + (4 * 36) + (8 * 51) = 240 + 48 + 196 + 144 + 408 = 1036\n\n   I need to keep enough items to exceed 394 in value. I want to offer Player 1 very little of item 3 since that's my highest value item, and I can afford to give a bit more of item 4 or item 5 since those items have relatively lower value to me.\n\n   Let's try keeping the following for myself: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5. The value of this offer is (1 * 80) + (1 * 24) + (1 * 98) + (2 * 36) + (5 * 51) = 80 + 24 + 98 + 72 + 255 = 529. This is greater than my outside offer of 394. Therefore, I will give Player 1 the remaining amounts of each item.\n\n   My offer to Player 1 (the counteroffer) would then be: [2, 1, 1, 2, 3] (3-1=2, 2-1=1, 2-1=1, 4-2=2, 8-5=3).\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n\n   Since the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 529. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 591 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 4, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 20 x 1 + 29 x 4 + 56 x 7\n    which is 528 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 529. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Calculate the value:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 15\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 77\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 58\n     - 5 units of item 5 = 280\n     - Total value = 15 + 77 + 0 + 58 + 280 = 430\n\n3) **Compare values:**\n   - The value of accepting the current offer is 430.\n   - After 3 rounds, the value is discounted by gamma ** (r-1) = 0.9 ** (3-1) = 0.81. So the adjusted value is 430 * 0.81 = 348.3.\n   - My outside offer value is 529, which is higher than the adjusted value of the current offer.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me a value less than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting is not advantageous.\n   - As it's the last round, making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away.\n   - Thus, walking away seems to be the best option as my outside offer is higher than the current discounted value of accepting.\n\nGiven this analysis, the optimal action is to walk away. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 81 x 2 + 91 x 1 + 49 x 0 + 28 x 1\n    which is 281 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 284. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 81 x 2 + 91 x 1 + 49 x 0 + 28 x 1\n    which is 281 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 284. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means I would keep:\n\n*   3 units of item 1 (6 - 3)\n*   5 units of item 2 (5 - 0)\n*   4 units of item 3 (4 - 0)\n*   1 unit of item 4 (1 - 0)\n*   5 units of item 5 (9 - 4)\n\nMy value for this would be: (3 \\* 13) + (5 \\* 88) + (4 \\* 77) + (1 \\* 34) + (5 \\* 22) = 39 + 440 + 308 + 34 + 110 = 931\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 1007. Let's adjust this offer.\nLet's try giving Player 1: [2, 0, 0, 0, 4]. This means I would keep:\n\n*   4 units of item 1 (6 - 2)\n*   5 units of item 2 (5 - 0)\n*   4 units of item 3 (4 - 0)\n*   1 unit of item 4 (1 - 0)\n*   5 units of item 5 (9 - 4)\n\nMy value for this would be: (4 \\* 13) + (5 \\* 88) + (4 \\* 77) + (1 \\* 34) + (5 \\* 22) = 52 + 440 + 308 + 34 + 110 = 944\n\nStill less than my outside offer. Let's try giving Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]. This means I would keep:\n\n*   5 units of item 1 (6 - 1)\n*   5 units of item 2 (5 - 0)\n*   4 units of item 3 (4 - 0)\n*   1 unit of item 4 (1 - 0)\n*   6 units of item 5 (9 - 3)\n\nMy value for this would be: (5 \\* 13) + (5 \\* 88) + (4 \\* 77) + (1 \\* 34) + (6 \\* 22) = 65 + 440 + 308 + 34 + 132 = 979\n\nStill less. Let's give them more item 1:\nLet's try giving Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]. This means I would keep:\n\n*   6 units of item 1 (6 - 0)\n*   5 units of item 2 (5 - 0)\n*   4 units of item 3 (4 - 0)\n*   1 unit of item 4 (1 - 0)\n*   6 units of item 5 (9 - 3)\n\nMy value for this would be: (6 \\* 13) + (5 \\* 88) + (4 \\* 77) + (1 \\* 34) + (6 \\* 22) = 78 + 440 + 308 + 34 + 132 = 992\n\nLet's try giving Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]. This means I would keep:\n\n*   6 units of item 1 (6 - 0)\n*   5 units of item 2 (5 - 0)\n*   4 units of item 3 (4 - 0)\n*   1 unit of item 4 (1 - 0)\n*   7 units of item 5 (9 - 2)\n\nMy value for this would be: (6 \\* 13) + (5 \\* 88) + (4 \\* 77) + (1 \\* 34) + (7 \\* 22) = 78 + 440 + 308 + 34 + 154 = 1014\n\nOkay, this is better than my outside offer. Let's give Player 1 one less item 5 to keep for myself:\nLet's try giving Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would keep:\n\n*   6 units of item 1 (6 - 0)\n*   5 units of item 2 (5 - 0)\n*   4 units of item 3 (4 - 0)\n*   1 unit of item 4 (1 - 0)\n*   8 units of item 5 (9 - 1)\n\nMy value for this would be: (6 \\* 13) + (5 \\* 88) + (4 \\* 77) + (1 \\* 34) + (8 \\* 22) = 78 + 440 + 308 + 34 + 176 = 1036\n\nGreat. Since round 1 is happening, let's use that discount factor:\n1036 * (0.9 ^ 0) = 1036\nSince 1036 > 1007, this is a good counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1062. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 3, 0, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 3 + 88 x 5 + 46 x 3 + 50 x 0 + 60 x 7\n    which is 1061 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1062. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 284. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 363 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 0, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 8 x 2 + 23 x 4 + 1 x 0 + 25 x 7\n    which is 283 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 284. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 5, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the optimal action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 284\n   - My values per unit: item 1: 64, item 2: 8, item 3: 23, item 4: 1, item 5: 25\n   - Total items: item 1: 3, item 2: 2, item 3: 6, item 4: 5, item 5: 7\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2. **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 5, 1, 1] (This is what *I* receive)\n   - Value of current offer: (0 * 64) + (0 * 8) + (5 * 23) + (1 * 1) + (1 * 25) = 0 + 0 + 115 + 1 + 25 = 141\n\n3. **Compare to outside offer:**\n\n   - Current offer value (141) < Outside offer value (284)\n\n4. **Consider a potential counteroffer:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should either WALK or make a COUNTEROFFER. Let's explore potential counteroffers that would be better than my outside offer. I need to keep enough items to get a value greater than 284.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1 (Keep most valuable items):** Keep all of item 1 (3 units), item 2 (2 units), 2 units of item 3, and 7 units of item 5. Give the rest to Player 1. This gives me:\n    * 3 * 64 + 2 * 8 + 2 * 23 + 0 * 1 + 7 * 25 = 192 + 16 + 46 + 0 + 175 = 429\n    * This means the counteroffer to Player 1 would be: [0, 0, 4, 5, 0].\n    * 429 > 284, so this is a good start.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 2 (Giving a bit more to the other player):** Giving the other player 1 unit of item 3, item 4, and item 5. This would lead to:\n    * Remaining for me: 3 items of Item 1 = 3 * 64 = 192\n    * Remaining for me: 2 items of Item 2 = 2 * 8 = 16\n    * Remaining for me: 5 items of Item 3 = 5 * 23 = 115\n    * Remaining for me: 4 items of Item 4 = 4 * 1 = 4\n    * Remaining for me: 6 items of Item 5 = 6 * 25 = 150\n    * Total: 192 + 16 + 115 + 4 + 150 = 477\n    * Giving to the other player: 0 items of Item 1, 0 items of Item 2, 1 items of Item 3, 1 items of Item 4, 1 items of Item 5\n    * Offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n5. **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is 141, which is worse than my outside offer of 284. I should make a counteroffer. Let's use Counteroffer 2: offer Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 1, 1].

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 284.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 64, item 2 = 8, item 3 = 23, item 4 = 1, item 5 = 25.\n   - Total items: 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 7 of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of the same offer accepted now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 2].\n     - This means I keep: 3 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n     - My value = (3 * 64) + (0 * 8) + (6 * 23) + (4 * 1) + (5 * 25) = 192 + 0 + 138 + 4 + 125 = 459.\n     - Since 459 > 284, accepting this offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n   - **Consider my last offer:** I offered Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means I kept [3, 2, 5, 4, 6]. The value of that was 3 * 64 + 2 * 8 + 5 * 23 + 4 * 1 + 6 * 25 = 192 + 16 + 115 + 4 + 150 = 477.\n\n3. **Potential counteroffers:** I want to make sure that any counteroffer I make is better than my outside offer. Since the current offer on the table is greater than my outside offer, it might be best to accept. However, let's explore some counteroffers to see if I can do better. I'll want to avoid the mistakes outlined above, in particular mistake 1 (making an offer worse than my previous offer).\n   - My previous offer to Player 1 was [0, 0, 1, 1, 1].\n   - Player 1 last offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 2] to me.\n\nI can propose a counteroffer that gives the other player slightly less. If I offered Player 1 [0,1,1,1,1] my payoff would be (3 * 64) + (1 * 8) + (5 * 23) + (4 * 1) + (6 * 25) = 192 + 8 + 115 + 4 + 150 = 469.\n\n4. **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer of 459 is already better than my outside offer of 284. The best offer I made for myself was 477, but I'll accept the current offer of 459 since that is on the table.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 156. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 927 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 41 x 2 + 87 x 0 + 36 x 2\n    which is 154 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 156. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 156. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 927 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 41 x 2 + 87 x 0 + 36 x 2\n    which is 154 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 156. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

We're in round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me is [0, 1, 1, 1, 2].\n\n   Calculating my total value if I accept this offer:\n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 53 = 0\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 92 = 92\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 41 = 41\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n   - Total value = 0 + 92 + 41 + 87 + 72 = 292\n   - Adjusted by the discount factor for round 2: 292 \u00d7 0.9 = 262.8\n\n   - Comparing this offer's value (262.8) to my outside offer (156), accepting the current offer is significantly more beneficial in terms of value.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - The offer on the table provides a value of 262.8 after adjusting for the round discount, which is much better than my outside offer of 156.\n   - The current offer is favorable, as accepting provides a higher payoff compared to my guaranteed fallback.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the logical action would be to accept the current offer since its value is better than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Therefore, Player 1 is keeping 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 18) + (5 * 27) + (2 * 5) + (0 * 56) + (0 * 76) = 0 + 135 + 10 + 0 + 0 = 145.\n    Since 145 > 81, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *at this round*.\n\n*   **Counteroffer Considerations:** Before accepting, let's quickly consider a potential counteroffer. I want to keep items that I value highly, and give away items that I value less. Item 5 is my highest value, then item 4, then item 2, item 1, and item 3. Given that this is the first round and the discount factor is 0.9, I might want to try for a better offer, rather than accepting right away.\n    Let's make a potential counteroffer that gives away all the items that I do not value highly (item 3) and gives a significant number of the rest of the items to Player 1, except for my most valued item 5.\n    I could offer Player 1 [3, 6, 5, 1, 0]. In this scenario, I would get [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. My value for this is (0 * 18) + (1 * 27) + (0 * 5) + (0 * 56) + (1 * 76) = 27 + 76 = 103. Since 103 > 81, this would be better than walking away.\n    If Player 1 accepts this, I get 103. If Player 1 counters, I have round 2 to decide again. I think this is worth the risk of not immediately accepting the offer, so long as my new offer is more advantageous for myself.\n\n3) **Decision:**\nAccepting the current offer gives me 145.\nWalking away gives me 81.\nThe counteroffer of [3, 6, 5, 1, 0] gives me 103.\n\nSince I am in round 1, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 6, 5, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 159. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 8 x 2 + 51 x 1 + 49 x 1 + 42 x 1\n    which is 158 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 159. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 6, 5, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 6, 5, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, I need to evaluate the current offer compared to my outside offer value, as well as consider potential counteroffers.\n\n1. **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 159.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 63\n     - Item 2: 8\n     - Item 3: 51\n     - Item 4: 49\n     - Item 5: 42\n   - The total pool of items is [3, 7, 5, 1, 1].\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) will slightly reduce the value over each round, but since we're in round 2 and only one step from the final round, its influence is minimal for immediate decisions.\n\n2. **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer [3, 6, 5, 1, 0]:\n     - Value to me if accepted: \n       - 3 \u00d7 63 (Item 1) + 6 \u00d7 8 (Item 2) + 5 \u00d7 51 (Item 3) + 1 \u00d7 49 (Item 4) + 0 \u00d7 42 (Item 5) \n       - = 189 + 48 + 255 + 49 + 0 \n       - = 541\n     - This value is significantly higher than my outside offer of 159.

There is no reason to propose a counteroffer here since I would not be able to achieve a deal with a value higher than 541 if I wait for the next round due to the discount factor.\n   \nBased on this analysis, I have determined the optimal action is to accept the current offer. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 4, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 2 + 80 x 0 + 34 x 4 + 32 x 5 + 17 x 3\n    which is 451 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 452. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 5, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 5, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 4, 7, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 87 x 7 + 67 x 4 + 29 x 7 + 73 x 4\n    which is 1372 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1373. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 5, 2, 6, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 5, 2, 6, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n3.  **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n\n    I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1373.

I can either walk away or make a counteroffer. Since I can make a counteroffer that gives me a higher value than my outside offer, that's the best option.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer where I give Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 430. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 570 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 0 + 7 x 1 + 92 x 3 + 49 x 2 + 16 x 3\n    which is 429 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 430. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n    *   My outside offer value: 430\n    *   My item values: item 1 = 26, item 2 = 7, item 3 = 92, item 4 = 49, item 5 = 16\n    *   Total items: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.

Accepting the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 only items they seem to want the least. I will make sure I get at least my outside offer value.\n\nTo do this, I will offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 0 + 7 x 1 + 92 x 3 + 49 x 2 + 16 x 3\n    which is 429 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 430. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n    *   My outside offer value is 430.\n    *   My item values are: item 1 = 26, item 2 = 7, item 3 = 92, item 4 = 49, item 5 = 16.\n    *   Total items: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n    *   Discount factor gamma = 0.9. This round is round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 3, 1, 0, 3]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n        *   Value of current offer: (1 * 26) + (3 * 7) + (1 * 92) + (0 * 49) + (3 * 16) = 26 + 21 + 92 + 0 + 48 = 187\n        *   Discounted value of current offer: 187 * 0.9 = 168.3\n\n    *   **Compare to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (168.3) is significantly less than my outside offer (430). Therefore, accepting is not a good idea.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to create a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 430. Let's consider some possibilities. Since player 1 seems not to value item 3 a lot, I would like to secure item 3 to myself. Let's make an offer where I keep all of item 3, item 4, and the first unit of item 1.\n\n        *   Keeping [0, 0, 3, 3, 0] for myself, which means offering [1, 3, 0, 0, 4] to Player 1. The value to me of [0, 0, 3, 3, 0] is (0 * 26) + (0 * 7) + (3 * 92) + (3 * 49) + (0 * 16) = 0 + 0 + 276 + 147 + 0 = 423, less than 430.\n\n        *   Let's try another offer: [0, 0, 3, 3, 1] for myself. This offer gives them [1, 3, 0, 0, 3]. The value of [0, 0, 3, 3, 1] to me is (0 * 26) + (0 * 7) + (3 * 92) + (3 * 49) + (1 * 16) = 0 + 0 + 276 + 147 + 16 = 439. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   Accepting the current offer is bad.\n    *   Walking away is a possibility, guaranteeing 430.\n    *   A counteroffer of [1, 3, 0, 0, 3] to Player 1, keeping [0, 0, 3, 3, 1], yields a value of 439, which is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [1, 3, 0, 0, 3].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

                    "response": "In this situation, I need to consider my outside offer value, the value I assign to each item, and the impact of the discount factor over the three rounds of negotiation.\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1186.\n   - The values I place on each item type are:\n     - Item 1: 18\n     - Item 2: 93\n     - Item 3: 66\n     - Item 4: 70\n     - Item 5: 28\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 8 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor is 0.9, which means the potential value decreases the longer we negotiate.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Since there's no current offer from Player 2, I need to consider potential counteroffers that would maximize my value while exceeding my outside offer of 1186.\n   - To make a reasonable first offer, I will try to strike a balance that leaves me with a value slightly higher than 1186, ensuring it wouldn't be rejected immediately by leaving some value for Player 2.\n\n   Let's begin by assessing an initial potential counteroffer: Offer all items of low value to me, and keep high value ones. \n\n   Assume:\n   - I offer Player 2 a low number of item 2 (since that's valuable to me) and more of other items:\n     - [0, 6, 1, 1, 3] offered to Player 2\n   - I keep:\n     - [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n\n   Value calculation of what I keep:\n   - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n   - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n   - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n   - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n   - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n\n   Total value for me: 36 + 186 + 132 + 140 + 84 = 578 \n\n   Clearly, the total value (578) is nowhere near my outside offer of 1186. I need to retain more value.\n\n   Let me adjust and reduce some items given to Player 2.\n\n   Now I will try:\n   - Offer [0, 8, 0, 1, 4] to Player 2\n   - I keep [2, 0, 3, 2, 2]\n\n   New Value calculation of what I keep:\n   - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n   - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 93 = 0\n   - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n   - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n   - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n\n   Total value for me is 36 + 0 + 198 + 140 + 56 = 430. \n\n   This keeps me very low as well. \n\n   I will adjust once again:\n\n   Let's make another attempt:\n   - Offer [0, 7, 0, 0, 3] to Player 2\n   - I keep [2, 1, 3, 3, 3]\n\n   New Value calculation of what I keep:\n   - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n   - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n   - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 70 = 210\n   - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n\n   Total value for me is 36 + 93 + 198 + 210 + 84 = 621.\n\nThis step has shown that immediate improvisation is not leading me to a competitive offer better than my outside value recommendation of 1186.\n\nI need a drastic approach in retention, drastically reducing items granted.\n\nTry giving up:\n  - [1, 7, 0, 0, 3]\n  - I keep [1, 1, 3, 3, 3]\n\n   Value calculation of what I keep:\n   - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n   - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n   - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 70 = 210\n   - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n\n   Total value for me is 18 + 93 + 198 + 210 + 84 = 603\n\n   This offer still fails to meet my outside offer, meaning I cannot provide you with an opt-out ratio due to the constraint of the finite proliferation of available items.\n\nI must therefore propose an offer that best maintains constraints without exceeding suboptimal offers. Here is a proposed counteroffer with known logic flaws to plow the soil:\n\nOffer up:\n- [0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWith additional calculations required post-hoc.\n\nGiven these attempts don't break the desired total but allow balance. This strategic reset leads us to considering a formal \"walking away\" status.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 310. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 310. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 939 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 42 x 1 + 8 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 89 x 3\n    which is 309 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 42 x 1 + 8 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 89 x 3\n    which is 309 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 5, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 2 + 13 x 2 + 85 x 5 + 52 x 0 + 2 x 0\n    which is 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 652. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer gives me [0, 4, 2, 0, 6].

The key is to avoid the five mistakes.\n*   Let's consider what Player 1's offer implies. They're giving me all of item 2 and all of item 5. This suggests they may not value those items as highly as I do. They are keeping all units of item 1 and item 4. This suggests they highly value those items. They're keeping 3 units of item 3.\n\nNow let's consider a counteroffer. To ensure that my counteroffer avoids mistake 2 and is greater than my outside offer, I want to keep items that I value more and offer items that I value less.\n\nI could offer Player 1 the following: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis means that I keep all items for myself:\n3 units of item 1 = 3 * 54 = 162\n4 units of item 2 = 4 * 54 = 216\n5 units of item 3 = 5 * 68 = 340\n2 units of item 4 = 2 * 12 = 24\n6 units of item 5 = 6 * 31 = 186\nTotal value: 162 + 216 + 340 + 24 + 186 = 928\n928 > 528.\n\nNow, considering the other mistakes:\n\n*   Mistake 1: I have not made a previous offer, so I cannot make an offer worse than the previous.\n*   Mistake 3: I'm not offering all items.\n*   Mistake 4: This doesn't apply yet.\n*   Mistake 5: I'm not walking away from an offer better than my outside offer right now because I am considering a counteroffer.\n\nSince the current offer is only slightly better than my outside offer, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 89 x 3 + 40 x 1 + 21 x 1 + 53 x 3\n    which is 487 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 489. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 0 + 45 x 0 + 58 x 2 + 72 x 4 + 13 x 0\n    which is 404 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 405. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's calculate the value if I keep all the items.\n   - (3 * 92) + (7 * 34) + (4 * 80) + (8 * 89) + (3 * 9) = 276 + 238 + 320 + 712 + 27 = 1573. So, I need to keep enough items for a total value exceeding 969.\n\nSince the current offer of 863 is less than my outside offer value of 969, I should not accept.  Also, since it is round 1, I should make a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer where I offer the other player only 1 unit each of all items.\nThis means I keep [2, 6, 3, 7, 2] for myself.\nThe value I get is (2*92) + (6*34) + (3*80) + (7*89) + (2*9) = 184 + 204 + 240 + 623 + 18 = 1269\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 969, so it is a possible counteroffer.\n\nAnother potential counteroffer is that I offer them [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] units. Then I keep [2, 5, 3, 6, 2].\nMy value would be (2 * 92) + (5 * 34) + (3 * 80) + (6 * 89) + (2 * 9) = 184 + 170 + 240 + 534 + 18 = 1146. This is also higher than my outside offer.\n\nAnother strategy would be to make them an offer that only gives them items they may value less. Since they offered me item 2, item 4, and item 5, maybe they don't value those as much.\n\nLet's try to offer them only 1 unit each of item 1 and item 3.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 0 + 45 x 0 + 58 x 2 + 72 x 4 + 13 x 0\n    which is 404 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 405. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 2, 4, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus:\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting the offer is not beneficial.\n   - Walking away gives me a sure value of 405.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer: I need to find a division of items better than 243 which favors the most valuable items to me.\n\nTo propose a counteroffer, I should focus on item types that contribute most to my value: items 3 and 4. Let's calculate a counteroffer where I try to maximize what I keep.\n\nI will attempt:\n- Give away [0, 3, 0, 2, 3] (a different division).\n\n- My resulting value keeping [3, 4, 4, 6, 0]:\n  - 3 x 55 (item 1) = 165\n  - 4 x 45 (item 2) = 180\n  - 4 x 58 (item 3) = 232\n  - 6 x 72 (item 4) = 432\n  - 0 x 13 (item 5) = 0\n- Total Value = 1009 \n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 405, and a significant improvement over the current offer of 243.

Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means accepting an offer now is worth 0.9 times what it would be worth in round 3.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** [0, 3, 0, 2, 3] offered to me.

I also need to give Player 1 something they value to get them to accept. Let's consider a counteroffer where I give up some of item 4 since it is very valuable to me: [0, 4, 0, 4, 3].

[1, 5, 2, 0, 3]\n      My Keep would be: [2, 2, 2, 8, 0]\n      My value would be: (2 * 92) + (2 * 34) + (2 * 80) + (8 * 89) + (0 * 9) = 184 + 68 + 160 + 712 + 0 = 1124\n      Adjusted value: 1124 * 0.9 = 1011.6\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   - The current offer is worth 1139.4, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 969.\n   - The proposed counteroffer [1, 5, 2, 0, 3] nets me 1011.6 which is greater than my outside offer.\n   - Since the current offer is the best of all options I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

However, since we're in the first round, the discount factor does not yet impact the current valuation of offers.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - No current offer from Player 2.\n   - I need to consider a counteroffer that gives me a value at least equal to my outside offer (1229) or better.\n   - Calculate value if I propose giving away some units:\n\n     Let's consider an initial generous offer, as Player 1 starts the negotiation: I'll offer 0 of items with high value to me and all units of item 5 which has the least value:\n\n     - Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6] (keeping all of items 1 to 4 which are of higher value to me)\n\n     Now, calculate my value keeping this proposed counteroffer:\n     - 6 units of item 1: 6 * 71 = 426\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 32 = 64\n     - 6 units of item 3: 6 * 61 = 366\n     - 5 units of item 4: 5 * 74 = 370\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 6 = 0\n\n     Total value = 426 + 64 + 366 + 370 + 0 = 1226\n\n   - This offer gives me a value of 1226, which is slightly less than my outside offer but very close to it. However, given we are on the first round, it's strategic to start slightly lower to allow room for negotiation.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Since I cannot accept since there's no offer yet, nor should I walk away in the first round when my proposed offer is close to my fallback, I will propose the counteroffer as calculated.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 89 x 2 + 51 x 3 + 79 x 4 + 40 x 3\n    which is 767 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 768. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's adjust:\n   \n   - Revised counteroffer: [0, 0, 2, 3, 6], keeping [6, 2, 4, 2, 0]\n   - My revised retained value:\n     - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 71 = 426\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n     - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n     - Total value = 426 + 64 + 244 + 148 = 882\n\n   - This revised counteroffer results in a decreased value compared to simply walking away.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 1, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 5 + 94 x 0 + 15 x 1 + 81 x 4 + 98 x 1\n    which is 612 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 613. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 492.\n*   My values for items 1-5 are: 48, 82, 79, 28, 97.\n*   Total items available are: 8, 0, 2, 4, 4.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 1].  This means I keep: [8-2, 0-0, 2-1, 4-1, 4-1] = [6, 0, 1, 3, 3].\n    *   Value of keeping [6, 0, 1, 3, 3]: (6 * 48) + (0 * 82) + (1 * 79) + (3 * 28) + (3 * 97) = 288 + 0 + 79 + 84 + 291 = 742.\n    *   Since 742 > 492, accepting the current offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider potential counteroffers that give me a value greater than 492. The other player's offer gives me 742. If I make a counteroffer that is rejected and leads to a walk in rounds 2 or 3, I get 492 * 0.9 or 492 * 0.9 * 0.9, so I don't want to be too greedy.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I only give the other player minimal value. I should target to get at least some of each item that I value.\n\n* Consider offering [6, 0, 2, 3, 3]. This gives me [2, 0, 0, 1, 1], with value (2*48)+(0*82)+(0*79)+(1*28)+(1*97) = 96+0+0+28+97 = 221. This is way too low, worse than the outside offer.\n\n* I should consider the value of each item to me. Item 5 is the most valuable to me, followed by item 3 and item 1.\n* I want to make a counteroffer that is better for me than the current offer, while not being so greedy that it is rejected.\nThe current offer gives me [6, 0, 1, 3, 3]. I value this at 742.\nThe items are [8,0,2,4,4].\n\nLet's try a counteroffer of giving away [3, 0, 1, 2, 2]. That means I keep [5, 0, 1, 2, 2], which has value 5*48 + 0*82 + 1*79 + 2*28 + 2*97 = 240 + 0 + 79 + 56 + 194 = 569.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer of giving away [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]. That means I keep [6, 0, 2, 2, 3], which has value 6*48 + 0*82 + 2*79 + 2*28 + 3*97 = 288 + 0 + 158 + 56 + 291 = 793. This is higher than the current offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince I'm in round 1, and I can make a counteroffer, I should propose a counteroffer that increases my value while still leaving something on the table for Player 1.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]}\n",

I need a total value above 613.\n\n**Potential Counteroffer Calculation**:\n- Let's try offering Player 2: [3, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n  - My allocation then would be: [5, 0, 1, 3, 3]\n  - Value to me:\n    - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 35 = 175\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 94 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n    - Total value = 175 + 0 + 15 + 243 + 294 = 727\n\nIn this scenario, my value from the counteroffer would be 727, which is above 613. To make sure this counteroffer anticipates the opponent's values and interests, we'll proceed with it.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 492. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 492. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1002 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 3 + 82 x 0 + 79 x 0 + 28 x 2 + 97 x 3\n    which is 491 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 492. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 1 + 47 x 0 + 11 x 1 + 99 x 0 + 61 x 0\n    which is 13 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 18. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 0, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 1 + 49 x 2 + 4 x 0 + 96 x 3 + 64 x 6\n    which is 828 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 829. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 1, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 25 x 1 + 32 x 4 + 74 x 1 + 37 x 7\n    which is 486 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 487. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 1, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 25 x 1 + 32 x 4 + 74 x 1 + 37 x 7\n    which is 486 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 487. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 487\n    *   My values for items: item 1 = 10, item 2 = 25, item 3 = 32, item 4 = 74, item 5 = 37\n    *   Total items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 4, item 3 = 4, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 8\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.9 times the value, and accepting in round 3 gives me 0.9^2 times the value.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n    *   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 4, 0, 3].\n    *   This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 \\* 10) + (0 \\* 25) + (4 \\* 32) + (0 \\* 74) + (3 \\* 37) = 0 + 0 + 128 + 0 + 111 = 239.\n    *   Since it's round 2, I multiply by the discount factor: 239 * 0.9 = 215.1\n    *   215.1 < 487, therefore accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n3.  **Assess potential counteroffers:**\n\n    I need to calculate the value of keeping certain items and offering the rest to Player 1, then compare that value (discounted) with my outside offer.\n\n    *   Let's analyze the offer from Round 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]. This implies that Player 2 was keeping 2 of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 3 of Item 4 and 4 of Item 5.\n    *   My value if I kept those items: (2 \\* 10) + (2 \\* 25) + (2 \\* 32) + (3 \\* 74) + (4 \\* 37) = 20 + 50 + 64 + 222 + 148 = 504\n    *   504 * 0.9 (discount factor) = 453.6 which is lower than my outside offer of 487\n\n    To avoid mistakes I need to develop a counteroffer that will be better for me than my outside offer. Also I want it to be better than my last offer which would be mistake #1 (Making an offer worse than your previous offer.)\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 only items 1, 2 and 3:\n    *   If I offer them [2, 2, 2, 0, 0], I keep [2, 2, 2, 5, 8]\n    *   Value: (2 \\* 10) + (2 \\* 25) + (2 \\* 32) + (5 \\* 74) + (8 \\* 37) = 20 + 50 + 64 + 370 + 296 = 800\n    *   800 * 0.9 = 720, which is greater than my outside offer of 487\n    This would be a valid offer, and I would have a good outcome. But perhaps Player 1 would reject it.\n\n    Let's try an offer that gives Player 1 the remainder of my last offer, so there is some consistency between rounds. My last offer was [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]. Currently the offer on the table is [0, 0, 4, 0, 3].\n\n    Let's propose: Player 1 receives [2, 2, 4, 2, 4]. Then I receive [2, 2, 0, 3, 4].\n    Value to me: (2*10) + (2*25) + (0*32) + (3*74) + (4*37) = 20 + 50 + 0 + 222 + 148 = 440\n    440 * 0.9 = 396. That's not good enough\n\n    Let's analyze the offer of giving Player 1 zero units of items 4 and 5, to see if this improves things for me:\n    Offer Player 1 [4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n    Then I receive [0, 0, 0, 5, 8]\n    Value: (0*10) + (0*25) + (0*32) + (5*74) + (8*37) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 370 + 296 = 666\n    666 * 0.9 = 599.4. Much better\n\n    We should try this option as it is above the threshold, however Player 1 may refuse to accept it.\n\n4.  **Make a decision:**\n    The current offer is worse than my outside offer. Proposing [4, 4, 4, 0, 0] is better than my outside offer. I will choose this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 14 x 2 + 89 x 3 + 55 x 0 + 47 x 1\n    which is 342 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 343. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an agreement in a later round is worth less than an agreement now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. This means they are offering 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. Let's calculate the value to me if I accept this offer:\n      - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 1 = 1\n      - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 14 = 28\n      - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 89 = 89\n      - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 55 = 55\n      - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 47 = 47\n      - Total value = 1 + 28 + 89 + 55 + 47 = 220\n\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer (220) is less than my outside offer (343). Accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make sure the offer I give to Player 1 does not cause Mistake 2.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - I should not accept the current offer, as it is worse than my outside offer.\n   - I should not walk away immediately, as there might be potential for a better deal through a counteroffer.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer. I should offer player 1 a deal that leaves me with more value than 343.\n\nNow, let's try to find a good counteroffer. I want to keep the items I value highly, namely item 3, item 4, and item 5.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 3 + 51 x 4 + 83 x 3 + 13 x 0 + 45 x 1\n    which is 723 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 727. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - The current offer on the table is [0, 1, 2, 1, 0].

Therefore, I will not accept it.\n   - Walking away might be considered, but it's premature in round 2.\n   - Propose a counteroffer. I need a counteroffer where the items I keep have a total value exceeding the outside offer of 727.\n\n   Let's determine a potential counteroffer, focusing on maximizing my total value above 727.\n\n   **Potential Counteroffer:**\n   - Offer: [1, 4, 1, 2, 1] (Keeping [2, 0, 2, 1, 0] for myself)\n     - Calculate my value with this division:\n       - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n       - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 51 = 0\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n       - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n     - My Total Value = 150 + 0 + 166 + 13 = 329\n\n   This total value is still significantly below my outside offer value of 727. I need to propose a better weighted counteroffer while attempting not to give away too much value.\n\n   Let's adjust:\n   \n   - Offer: [0, 3, 2, 3, 0] (Keeping [3, 1, 1, 0, 1] for myself)\n     - Calculate my value with this division:\n       - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n       - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n       - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n       - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n     - My Total Value = 225 + 51 + 83 + 0 + 45 = 404\n\n   Unfortunately, this value is still less than my outside offer. To meet my objective, I'll retain even more valuable items:\n\n   Offer: [1, 3, 1, 3, 1] (Keeping [2, 1, 2, 0, 0])\n   - Calculate my value with this division:\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n     - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n     - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n     - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n   - My Total Value = 150 + 51 + 166 = 367\n\nThis offer is not feasible either. Therefore, re-evaluating:\n\nLet me offer: [0, 2, 2, 1, 0] (Keeping [3, 2, 1, 2, 1] for myself)\n- Calculate my value with this division:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n- My Total Value = 225 + 102 + 83 + 26 + 45 = 481\n\nAgain, this isn't favorable. Adjusting further:\n\nFinal attempt: Offer: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] (Keeping [2, 2, 2, 1, 0])\n- Calculate my value with this division:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n- Total Value = 150 + 102 + 166 + 13 = 431\n\nEventually, recognizing this situation, my counteroffer will be structured based:\n\nOffer: [0, 2, 1, 1, 0] (Retain 727 as potential higher values) \n- Value breakdown for me from remaining:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n  \nSo, I'll stick with the alternative offered by outside 727 to guarantee sought positive yield. Counteroffer to feasible value expecting player alignmentformedUser Player equitable, cooperative setup bases   \n\n---\n\nMaking Action Here:\n\nTherefore, I found no viable counteroffer strategy to meet 727 value threshold. Walking remains plenty given current contents sustain neg-align, preclude fault detection error sequences ascertain.\n\nMy action, therefore, is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 19. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1101 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 65 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 19. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

This means I get:\n        - 0 units of item 1\n        - 1 unit of item 2\n        - 2 units of item 3\n        - 3 units of item 4\n        - 1 unit of item 5\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 28) + (1 * 47) + (2 * 37) + (3 * 31) + (1 * 23) = 0 + 47 + 74 + 93 + 23 = 237.\n    237 < 324\n\n   - **Consider a potential counteroffer:** I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer of 324.\n   I have 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 2 of item 5 in total.\n   Let's start by calculating my maximum possible value: (4 * 28) + (3 * 47) + (5 * 37) + (6 * 31) + (2 * 23) = 112 + 141 + 185 + 186 + 46 = 670.\n\n   I will try to calculate an offer where my value is higher than my outside offer and is potentially better than my current offer, keeping in mind the other player's offer and the items they may value less.\n   - Current offer: [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n   - I have: 4 item 1, 3 item 2, 5 item 3, 6 item 4, 2 item 5.\n   - I will counter with something that might be attractive to them while getting what I want. Player 1 gave me little of item 2 and 4. I need to offer them something they want, based on what they did not offer me. I also need to retain at least my outside offer.\n\n   I will start by giving the other player more of the items I value less (1, 4, 5) and less of the ones I value more (2, 3):\n   - Offer: [2, 0, 3, 4, 0]\n   - I keep: [2, 3, 2, 2, 2]\n   - Value = (2 * 28) + (3 * 47) + (2 * 37) + (2 * 31) + (2 * 23) = 56 + 141 + 74 + 62 + 46 = 379\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is worth 237 to me, which is less than my outside offer of 324. I should reject this offer.\n   - My counteroffer of [2, 0, 3, 4, 0] yields a value of 379 for me, which is higher than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 3, 4, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 19. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 19. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1101 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 65 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 19. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 3, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 3, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer in round 3 is worth 81% of its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 5, 4, 4] (what I receive)\n   - My value from accepting: (0 * 73) + (0 * 2) + (5 * 90) + (4 * 2) + (4 * 75) = 0 + 0 + 450 + 8 + 300 = 758\n\n   - Compare to outside offer: 758 > 590. Accepting the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer (but likely unnecessary):**\n\n   Since the current offer gives me 758, which is greater than my outside offer of 590, it is already a good deal. Let's still consider a counteroffer to be thorough and avoid mistake 5, though.\n   I have items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 6, item 3 = 0, item 4 = 0, item 5 = 0.\n   The total value is: 4 * 73 + 6 * 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 292 + 12 = 304. This is much lower than 590.\n   Let's try offering only 1 unit of item 3 to Player 1. Then the values are:\n   4 * 73 + 6 * 2 + 4 * 90 + 0 + 0 = 292 + 12 + 360 = 664, also greater than my outside offer.\n   Let's try offering 2 units of item 3 to Player 1. Then the values are:\n   4 * 73 + 6 * 2 + 3 * 90 + 0 + 0 = 292 + 12 + 270 = 574, which is lower than my outside offer.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n\n   Since the current offer gives me a value of 758, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 590, and any slight changes cause the counteroffer to be lower than my outside offer, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 83 x 3 + 73 x 5 + 26 x 2\n    which is 666 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 668. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 668.\n   - The values of the items to me are: \n     - Item 1: 5\n     - Item 2: 5\n     - Item 3: 83\n     - Item 4: 73\n     - Item 5: 26\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 7 units of item 1, \n     - 2 units of item 2, \n     - 3 units of item 3, \n     - 5 units of item 4, \n     - 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) influences the value by reducing the effective value of receiving items in later rounds. Since it's now round 2, if we reach round 3, any offer will be discounted by the gamma factor.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to me:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 83 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 73 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n     - Total value = 5\n   \n   - Compare the current offer value (5) to the outside offer (668).

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 593\n*   My values for items: item 1 = 25, item 2 = 37, item 3 = 1, item 4 = 57, item 5 = 83\n*   Total items: item 1 = 7, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 3, item 4 = 5, item 5 = 2\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that the value of an offer in the next round is multiplied by 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\nThe current offer is [6, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n*   My value for this offer: (6 * 25) + (2 * 37) + (0 * 1) + (0 * 57) + (0 * 83) = 150 + 74 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 224\n\n*   If I accept, my value is 224. This is less than my outside offer of 593.\n\n3) **Consider Counteroffers:**\nSince accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer. I will explore a counteroffer. The total amounts available of each item are [7, 2, 3, 5, 2]. If I give [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5] to Player 1, I will keep [7-x1, 2-x2, 3-x3, 5-x4, 2-x5]. My value for keeping these items is:\n\nValue = 25*(7-x1) + 37*(2-x2) + 1*(3-x3) + 57*(5-x4) + 83*(2-x5)\nValue = 175 - 25x1 + 74 - 37x2 + 3 - x3 + 285 - 57x4 + 166 - 83x5\nValue = 703 - 25x1 - 37x2 - x3 - 57x4 - 83x5\n\nI need this value to be greater than 593. So:\n703 - 25x1 - 37x2 - x3 - 57x4 - 83x5 > 593\n110 > 25x1 + 37x2 + x3 + 57x4 + 83x5\n\nLet's see if I can construct an offer that satisfies this. I need to offer Player 1 enough to make them happy, but keep enough for myself to beat my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering them all of items 3, 4 and 5, since I don't value them much. My counteroffer would be [0, 0, 3, 5, 2]. The value I keep is: (7 * 25) + (2 * 37) + (0 * 1) + (0 * 57) + (0 * 83) = 175 + 74 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 249. This is still not enough.\n\nLet's try offering all of item 2, 3, 4, 5. My counteroffer is [0, 2, 3, 5, 2].\nThe value I keep is (7 * 25) + (0 * 37) + (0 * 1) + (0 * 57) + (0 * 83) = 175. This is not nearly enough.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer of [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The value I keep is:\n(4 * 25) + (2 * 37) + (3 * 1) + (5 * 57) + (2 * 83) = 100 + 74 + 3 + 285 + 166 = 628. This is better than my outside offer.\n\nSo, I'll make a counteroffer of [3, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 0 + 65 x 1 + 55 x 3 + 17 x 4 + 5 x 0\n    which is 298 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 299. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For example, if I keep [2, 2, 3, 4, 5] units (meaning I give away [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]):\n     - Value = (2 * 83) + (2 * 16) + (3 * 53) + (4 * 44) + (5 * 61) = 166 + 32 + 159 + 176 + 305 = 838\n     - Offering [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] to the other player, my remaining value (838) is way above my outside offer (241).\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Given that there's no current offer and aiming for a value significantly above my outside offer, I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while making a reasonable offer to Player 2.\n   - My aim is to propose a counteroffer where I can retain most value without risking a \"walk away\" from Player 2 too early in negotiations.\n\nI will make an initial counteroffer that gives away some less valuable items (to me) while maintaining a high total value for myself:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 322. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 322.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 86, 27, 14, 60, 70, respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 2, 4, 3, 4, 5 units, respectively.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 2, 0, 0, 0].  This means I get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is (0 * 86) + (2 * 27) + (0 * 14) + (0 * 60) + (0 * 70) = 54. This is much less than my outside offer of 322.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to calculate the value of potential counteroffers to ensure I'm not making mistakes 1, 2, or 3. Also, I need to consider the potential impact on Player 1 based on their offer, to try and discern their value.\n   - Let's calculate what I keep if I offer player 1 [2, 2, 3, 4, 5]:\n    (0 * 86) + (2 * 27) + (0 * 14) + (0 * 60) + (0 * 70) = 54. Not enough\n\n   - Let's calculate what I keep if I offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n    (2 * 86) + (4 * 27) + (3 * 14) + (4 * 60) + (5 * 70) = 172 + 108 + 42 + 240 + 350 = 912.  This is the maximum.\n\n   - Let's calculate what I keep if I offer player 1 [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]:\n    (1 * 86) + (2 * 27) + (2 * 14) + (2 * 60) + (3 * 70) = 86 + 54 + 28 + 120 + 210 = 498.  This is greater than 322.\n\n   - Let's calculate what I keep if I offer player 1 [0, 0, 3, 4, 5]:\n    (2 * 86) + (4 * 27) + (0 * 14) + (0 * 60) + (0 * 70) = 172 + 108 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 280.  This is less than 322.\n\n   - Let's calculate what I keep if I offer player 1 [2, 4, 0, 4, 0]:\n    (0 * 86) + (0 * 27) + (3 * 14) + (0 * 60) + (5 * 70) = 0 + 0 + 42 + 0 + 350 = 392.  This is greater than 322.\n\n   - How do these values compare to my outside offer value? I need to make sure any counteroffer leaves me with more than 322.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is terrible (54 << 322). I should definitely not accept it.\n   - Walking away would give me 322.\n   - I want to make a counteroffer that gives me more than 322 and hopefully is acceptable to Player 1. Player 1's offer of [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] suggests they value item 2 relatively less than the others.\n\n   - I will propose [1, 2, 1, 2, 2] to Player 1.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 552. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 816 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 0, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 1 + 51 x 3 + 49 x 0 + 70 x 2 + 78 x 3\n    which is 551 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 552. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Hence, current round values are not discounted.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2.\n   - I'm interested in finding a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer value of 552. \n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer where I maximize keeping the higher-value items based on my private values:\n\n- I'll retain more units of the higher-value items and fewer of the lower-value units.\n- My plan is to start proposing that I keep fewer items initially, assessing whether it would allow me to propose a division greater than 552.\n\nLet's propose keeping:\n- Item 1: 5 (Leaving 4 for Player 2)\n- Item 2: 2 (Leaving 2 for Player 2)\n- Item 3: 1 (Leaving 2 for Player 2)\n- Item 4: 1 (Leaving 1 for Player 2)\n- Item 5: 2 (Leaving 1 for Player 2)\n\nMy value calculation for keeping these items:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 x 24 = 120\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 x 51 = 102\n- 1 units of item 3: 1 x 49 = 49\n- 1 units of item 4: 1 x 70 = 70\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 x 78 = 156\n\nTotal value: 120 + 102 + 49 + 70 + 156 = 497\n\nThis total value is below my outside offer of 552. Therefore, I need to reconfigure my offer to increase the value of what I retain.\n\nAdjusting the proposal:\nLet's retain one more of item 5 and decrease what I give of item 1 to the opponent slightly more.\n\nRevised proposal:\n- Item 1: 5 (Keeping 4)\n- Item 2: 2 (Keeping 2)\n- Item 3: 1 (Keeping 2)\n- Item 4: 1 (Keeping 1)\n- Item 5: 3 (Keeping all)\n\nValue calculation:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 x 24 = 96\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 x 51 = 102\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 x 49 = 98\n- 1 units of item 4: 1 x 70 = 70\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 x 78 = 234\n\nTotal value: 96 + 102 + 98 + 70 + 234 = 600\n\nNow the value exceeds my outside offer of 552.

                    "response": "Certainly, let's go through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 611.\n   - My private values per unit for items are:\n     - Item 1: 43\n     - Item 2: 14\n     - Item 3: 18\n     - Item 4: 29\n     - Item 5: 73\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) will reduce the value of my payoff if the negotiation extends to subsequent rounds, but in the first round, it hasn't taken effect yet.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer for me to accept.\n   - Let's consider potential counteroffers where I aim to secure a total value greater than my outside offer of 611.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I need to propose an initial offer to Player 2. I need to ensure that the items I keep have a value greater than 611.\n\nLet's calculate a possible counteroffer. Suppose I propose keeping the majority of high-value items for myself since my outside offer is relatively high compared to the total possible value (680), and let's see how it stands up:\n\n- I'll propose offering Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\nThus, my counteroffer will be to keep:\n- 2 units of item 1 (2 \u00d7 43 = 86)\n- 0 units of item 2 (0 \u00d7 14 = 0)\n- 0 units of item 3 (0 \u00d7 18 = 0)\n- 0 units of item 4 (0 \u00d7 29 = 0)\n- 4 units of item 5 (4 \u00d7 73 = 292)\n\nThe value I get from this division:\n- Total value = 86 + 292 = 378\n\nSince 378 is less than my outside offer of 611, I'll revise the offer. Let's adjust to keep the higher-value items for myself.\n\n- I'll offer Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\nNow let's calculate my value in this scenario:\n- Keeping:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n\nTotal Value = 43 + 28 + 18 + 29 + 146 = 264\n\nSince 264 is still less than the outside offer of 611, it would be a mistake to propose this. Let's make another adjustment where I'll sacrifice lower-cost items for the higher values.\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 2 unit of item 5\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- I'm keeping:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 86\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 18\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 29\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 146\n\nTotal value = 86 + 0 + 18 + 29 + 146 = 279\n\nAgain, this is not sufficient. I'll need to maximize item 5.\n\nLet's decide based on maximizing the highest value:\n\nOffer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 86\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 58\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 146 (73 \u00d7 4 - where originally was 4)\n\nTotal value = 86 + 0 + 0 + 58 + 292 = 436\n\nNo value lowers the 611, let me re-try zeroing much of lower-value goods and keeping all 5 units:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\nI keep:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n  - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 73 = 292\n\nTotal value = 86 + 0 + 0 + 58 + 292 = 436\n\nStill, it doesn't make it greater than the outside offer, Finding no combination at first attempt increases value:\n\nAs suggested approach isn't clearing offers I will clear attempt;\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 57 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 55 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 34. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1's offer indicates they value item 3, item 4, and item 5, but maybe not item 2 as they offer me all of it. My values are such that I most highly value item 5, and fairly high for items 2 and 3.\n\n    * Let's calculate my value if I keep all of item 5 and give the rest to Player 1.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 297. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 507 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 17 x 4 + 29 x 0 + 1 x 3 + 75 x 3\n    which is 296 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 297. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 1, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means an offer in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 2, 0, 4, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n     My value if I accept: (0 * 91) + (2 * 12) + (0 * 94) + (4 * 89) + (0 * 79) = 0 + 24 + 0 + 356 + 0 = 380.\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 380 is much less than my outside offer of 963.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n     I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 963 * 0.9 = 866.7 to make a counteroffer worthwhile at this round, as the game could end now.\n     If the current offer is bad, I need to come up with a reasonable offer that is better than my outside offer after accounting for the discount factor in the next round.\n     Let's try keeping most of the items I value highly and offering the rest.\n     Consider this potential offer to Player 1: [4, 4, 4, 4, 2]. This means I would keep 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 6 units of item 5 for myself.\n        My value: (0 * 91) + (0 * 12) + (0 * 94) + (0 * 89) + (6 * 79) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 474 = 474. This is too low, so I shouldn't make this counteroffer.\n\n     How about I keep 4 of item 1, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 8 of item 5? Offering [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]:\n      My value: (4 * 91) + (0 * 12) + (4 * 94) + (4 * 89) + (8 * 79) = 364 + 0 + 376 + 356 + 632 = 1728\n      Since 1728 * 0.9 = 1555.2 > 963 and I need to make an offer that is better for me than 963 * 0.9 = 866.7, this offer might be worth considering.\n      I will now make this counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is terrible (380 < 963).\n   - I will make a counteroffer [0, 4, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 53 x 1 + 36 x 1 + 54 x 6 + 62 x 3\n    which is 599 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 600.

Let's start by considering keeping everything and slowly giving away items to Player 1 until I reach a value above my outside offer if they accept.\n   - First, let's calculate the value of keeping everything:\n      - Item 1: 6 units * 62 = 372\n      - Item 2: 3 units * 87 = 261\n      - Item 3: 2 units * 15 = 30\n      - Item 4: 7 units * 86 = 602\n      - Item 5: 9 units * 2 = 18\n      - Total value = 372 + 261 + 30 + 602 + 18 = 1283\n   - To make an offer, I need to decide which items to give away. Since Item 5 is least valuable to me, I will give all of it to the other player and slowly give units of the next least valuable items to the other player.\n   - Let's try offering all 9 of Item 5, and 0 of others, the value I keep will be = 1283 - 9 * 2 = 1265\n   - Let's now try offering all 9 of Item 5, all 2 of Item 3, the value I keep will be = 1283 - 9 * 2 - 2 * 15 = 1235\n   - Let's now try offering all 9 of Item 5, all 2 of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 1: 1283 - 9 * 2 - 2 * 15 - 1 * 62 = 1173\n   - Let's now try offering all 9 of Item 5, all 2 of Item 3, 2 units of Item 1: 1283 - 9 * 2 - 2 * 15 - 2 * 62 = 1111\n   - Let's now try offering all 9 of Item 5, all 2 of Item 3, 3 units of Item 1: 1283 - 9 * 2 - 2 * 15 - 3 * 62 = 1049\n   - Let's now try offering all 9 of Item 5, all 2 of Item 3, 4 units of Item 1: 1283 - 9 * 2 - 2 * 15 - 4 * 62 = 987\n   - Okay, so offering [4, 0, 2, 0, 9] to Player 1 results in a value of 987 for me, which is slightly better than my outside offer.\n\n4. **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n   - I can make a counteroffer that is slightly better than my outside offer.\n   - Therefore, I should make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 2, 0, 9]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 600. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 53 x 1 + 36 x 1 + 54 x 6 + 62 x 3\n    which is 599 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 600. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means I would get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 20 = 20\n    *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 26 = 26\n    *   3 units of item 3 = 3 * 67 = 201\n    *   1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 10 = 10\n    *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 52 = 52\n    *   Total value = 20 + 26 + 201 + 10 + 52 = 309\n    *   Since 309 < 684, accepting this offer is worse than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a division of items that is worth more than 684 to me. Since Player 1's offer is quite bad for me, let's think what it would be worth if I keep pretty much everything except a bit.\n\n    *What if I offered player 1 [3, 2, 5, 4, 4]? This means I keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n    * value = 20 * 1 + 26 * 1 + 67 * 1 + 10 * 1 + 52 * 1 = 175. This is terrible.\n\n    *What if I offered player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? This means I keep [4, 3, 6, 5, 5]\n    * value = 20 * 4 + 26 * 3 + 67 * 6 + 10 * 5 + 52 * 5 = 80 + 78 + 402 + 50 + 260 = 870. This is a perfect starting point.\n\n    Since I'm keeping everything at this offer, my offer will try to get closer to my outside value, to ensure I have room for negotiation. Let's try offering [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    *What if I offered player 1 [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]? This means I keep [3, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n    * value = 20 * 3 + 26 * 2 + 67 * 3 + 10 * 3 + 52 * 3 = 60 + 52 + 201 + 30 + 156 = 499. This is still a poor value.\n\n    Okay, let's offer a decent amount to test the other agent. How about [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]? This means I keep [3, 3, 5, 4, 4]\n    *value = 20 * 3 + 26 * 3 + 67 * 5 + 10 * 4 + 52 * 4 = 60 + 78 + 335 + 40 + 208 = 721\n\n    Since 721 > 684, this is a valid offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible for me.\n*   Walking away guarantees me 684.\n*   Offering [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] gives me a value of 721, which is greater than my outside offer, giving me room to negotiate if needed.\n\nTherefore, I should propose the counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 2, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 2 + 88 x 3 + 59 x 2 + 5 x 2 + 49 x 5\n    which is 783 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 784. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 1, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 5 + 14 x 3 + 9 x 1 + 41 x 2 + 47 x 3\n    which is 424 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 425. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 425\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 30, Item 2: 14, Item 3: 9, Item 4: 41, Item 5: 47\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means waiting for a better offer in future rounds is penalized by a factor of 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 2, 1, 3, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 2 * 30 = 60\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 14 = 28\n    *   Item 3: 1 * 9 = 9\n    *   Item 4: 3 * 41 = 123\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 47 = 47\n    *   Total value of current offer: 60 + 28 + 9 + 123 + 47 = 267\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 267 < 425. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer. I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value of 425.\n\nLet's try keeping all of items 4 and 5, since these are my highest value items. That would be:\n3 * 41 + 3 * 47 = 123 + 141 = 264.\nI need to get at least another 425 - 264 = 161 value from items 1, 2 and 3. Let me keep all of item 1. That gives me 5 * 30 = 150. Still need 11. Let's also keep one of item 2. That's an additional 14, giving 150+14=164, so this works!\n\nSo, if I keep [5, 1, 0, 3, 3], then I offer [0, 2, 3, 0, 0].\nMy value will be 5*30+1*14+0*9+3*41+3*47 = 150+14+0+123+141 = 428.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable as it's worth less than my outside offer. I will make a counteroffer where I keep items [5, 1, 0, 3, 3] and offer the remaining items to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 551. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 0 + 27 x 1 + 65 x 3 + 55 x 4 + 54 x 2\n    which is 550 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 551. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?
