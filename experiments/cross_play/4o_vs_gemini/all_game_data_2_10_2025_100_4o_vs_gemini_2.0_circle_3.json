                    "response": "To analyze the situation and determine my best course of action, I will break down the process:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1116.\n   - My values per unit for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 51\n     - Item 2: 43\n     - Item 3: 55\n     - Item 4: 83\n     - Item 5: 55\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, which means delaying to future rounds reduces the effective total value.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is currently no offer from Player 2.\n   - I need to make an initial offer. To decide what to offer, I must ensure that the items I keep have a total value greater than my outside offer (1116).\n\n3) Calculate potential counteroffers:\n   - Consider possible divisions and calculate the value to me:\n     - If I offer Player 2 one of each item except for item 4, calculating the value of items I keep:\n       - Keeping 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n       - Keeping 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n       - Keeping 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 55 = 275\n       - Keeping 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 83 = 415\n       - Keeping 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 55 = 55\n       - Total value = 941\n\nSeeing that this total value (941) is lower than my outside offer (1116), I must re-evaluate my proposal. But considering the negotiation dynamics favor me securing a value above or equating to 1000 after discount, a larger share is ideal. Let's calculate another scenario:\n\n   - Counterproposal to offer fewer of another set maintaining more of higher value items:\n     - Offer Player 2: 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 0 of item 5\n\n    Calculating for my retained item value:\n       - Keeping 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n       - Keeping 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n       - Keeping 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 55 = 165\n       - Keeping 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 83 = 332\n       - Keeping 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n       - Total value = 846\n\n   This total is still lower than my outside offer. I need a tighter distribution favoring high-value items exclusively.\n\n   Proposal optimization:  \n   Offer entirely low-value:\n   - Offer: 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 2 of item 5 \n\n   Check retained higher-value scenario:\n     - Keeping 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n     - Keeping 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n     - Keeping 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n     - Keeping 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n     - Keeping 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n     - Total value = 429\n\nI must go for maximum retention:\n\nWith a better yield upon full retention, pursuing high-value retention: \n\nDecisive Action: \n  - Offer minimal in higher units, pursue higher required retention in % terms.\n\nLet's finalize:\n  - Offer: Keep all items securing outside as last resort unless offer covers majority notably \u22651000 assured over 3-rnd pay-offs.\n\nProposing item retention balancing strategy with a revisal having gamma in perspective subsequently rounding decisions:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n(As total justifying extreme assurance outside tops my current appraisement offr.)",

This means I keep [3, 4, 8, 6, 5].\n        *   My value: (3 * 29) + (4 * 100) + (8 * 31) + (6 * 79) + (5 * 54) = 87 + 400 + 248 + 474 + 270 = 1479\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable. A counteroffer is the best option at this point. I need to offer Player 1 enough that they will accept, but I need to try and get more than my outside offer value, adjusted for the discount factor. Since we are in round 1, there is no discount yet.\n\nLet's try to be somewhat aggressive but realistic. The offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] gives me 1186. I want to get closer to that.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [1, 1, 4, 3, 2]. That leaves me with: [2, 3, 4, 3, 3]. My value would be: (2*29) + (3*100) + (4*31) + (3*79) + (3*54) = 58 + 300 + 124 + 237 + 162 = 881. This is not enough compared to my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]. That leaves me with: [3, 3, 6, 5, 4]. My value would be: (3*29) + (3*100) + (6*31) + (5*79) + (4*54) = 87 + 300 + 186 + 395 + 216 = 1184. This is slightly above my outside offer value and seems like a good initial counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

Therefore, I want to ensure a high-value outcome, ideally in earlier rounds to avoid this reduction.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\nCurrently, there is no offer from Player 2, so any offer consideration will be based on potential division:\n\n- **Total Value if I Keep All Items**:\n  - Item 1: 6 \u00d7 22 = 132\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n  - Item 4: 6 \u00d7 18 = 108\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n  - **Total Value = 132 + 264 + 108 + 97 = 601**\n\n- Evaluate counteroffers by testing different item distributions to see if the total retained value is greater than 518 (outside offer).\n\nExample Counteroffer Scenario (just initial consideration):\n- Offer all of Item 4 to maximize retention of high-value items:\n\n  #### Offer: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]\n  - My retained items:\n    - Item 1: 6 \u00d7 22 = 132\n    - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n  - My Total Value: 132 + 264 + 97 = 493\n\nThis value of 493 is less than my outside offer of 518, so I must adjust or consider an alternative offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\nThe goal of my counteroffer should be to retain a total value greater than my outside offer of 518 after accounting for any initial allocation.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffer\nInstead of offering all of a less valuable item, let's consider adjusting amounts:\n- Offer: [1, 0, 1, 3, 0] \n\nThis means:\n- Give 1 unit of Item 1 (Retain 5)\n- Give 3 units of Item 4 (Retain 3)\n- Give 1 unit of Item 3 (Retain 2)\n- Keep all of Item 5 (High value but only 1 unit)\n\n- My retained items:\n  - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 22 = 110\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n- **My Total Value = 110 + 176 + 54 + 97 = 437**\n\nThis total is still less than 518. I would continue to adjust the offer to see if there can be an optimal division. But assuming our first move needs an actionable offer, a narrow margin may not be identified without specific opponent incentives.\n\nBased on initial examination of keeping over 518, I realize direct counteroffering towards minimizing loss of higher value exclusives is critical. Increasing retention, focusing on best personal-item-value optimization, will likely need active iteration in actual constraints. \n\nHere's an actionable hypothetical start at potential trade-off:\n\n**Final Offer Consideration**: \n- Offer: [3, 0, 1, 2, 0] \n- Evaluation if retaining value gets higher than 518 must adjust swiftly next in.\n\nThe starting point seeks basic overlap if outside is actively valued for initial stance.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 1, 2, 0]}\n```\n",

If I counter offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], my value is:\n     - 6 * 7 + 0 * 95 + 3 * 98 + 6 * 85 + 1 * 15 = 42 + 0 + 294 + 510 + 15 = 861\n\n   If I give all the items to Player 1, my value is 0, which is terrible.\n   If I were to counteroffer, I should try to take all or most of item 3 and item 4 from player 1 as those are my highest values per item unit.\n   A reasonable counteroffer might be to try and get all of item 3 and at least half of item 4. If I offer player 1 [6, 0, 0, 3, 1] then my value is:\n     - 0 * 7 + 0 * 95 + 3 * 98 + 3 * 85 + 0 * 15 = 0 + 0 + 294 + 255 + 0 = 549\n     Which is also greater than my outside offer. \n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer (289) is worse than my outside offer (428).\n   - I should make a counteroffer that gets my value up as high as possible.\n\nSo, I will make the counteroffer to give Player 1 [6, 0, 0, 3, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 0, 3, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's follow the step-by-step process:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 518. If the negotiation doesn't result in a deal, I will receive this amount.\n   \n2. **Values of the Items:**\n   - Item 1: 22\n   - Item 2: 9 (but there are 0 units of this)\n   - Item 3: 88\n   - Item 4: 18\n   - Item 5: 97\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - 6 units of item 1\n   - 0 units of item 2\n   - 3 units of item 3\n   - 6 units of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n\n4. **Discount Factor Influence:**\n   - With a discount factor of 0.9 in round 2, the value of any deal is multiplied by 1 (since \\(0.9^{2-1} = 0.9^1 = 0.9\\)). Therefore, I should aim for a value that, when multiplied by 0.9, still exceeds 518.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer: [6, 0, 0, 3, 1]**\n   - Value of current offer:\n     - Item 1: 6 units \u00d7 22 per unit = 132\n     - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 88 per unit = 0\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 18 per unit = 54\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 97 per unit = 97\n   - Total value = 132 + 0 + 54 + 97 = 283\n\n2. **Value after applying discount factor**: 283 \u00d7 0.9 = 254.7\n\n3. **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n   - The discounted value of the current offer (254.7) is less than my outside offer value of 518.\n\n4. **Potential Counteroffers:**\n   - I want a counteroffer such that my retained items have a value > 518 after discounting. \n   - Assume I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 1 of item 5:\n     - Value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 22 = 66\n       - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 88 = 176\n       - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 18 = 72\n       - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 97 = 97\n     - Total retained value = 66 + 176 + 72 + 97 = 411\n       - Adjusted for discount = 411 \u00d7 0.9 = 369.9\n\nStill less than the outside offer, so I should propose a division which gives me even more units of valuable items.\n\n5. Let's try another division, such as:\n   - Keeping 5 of item 1, all of item 3, 4 of item 4, none of item 5:\n     - Value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 22 = 110\n       - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 88 = 264\n       - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 18 = 72\n     - Total retained value = 110 + 264 + 72 = 446\n     - Adjusted for discount = 446 \u00d7 0.9 = 401.4\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nThe highest reasonable retained value I found (401.4) is still less than 518. Given these calculations, I do not see a division that exceeds my outside offer value when adjusted for discounting. Negotiating further is unlikely to yield a value exceeding 518, so:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I have 7 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 in total.\n\nLet's try to give Player 1 fewer of the items I value highly.\nWhat if I offered them items worth less to me, whilst keeping valuable items myself?\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I keep most of item 3 and item 5, and more of item 1.\nI'll offer Player 1 [3, 5, 0, 3, 0].\n\n*   This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 3 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 5 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n*   My value: (4 \\* 42) + (1 \\* 21) + (3 \\* 55) + (2 \\* 27) + (1 \\* 55) = 168 + 21 + 165 + 54 + 55 = 463\n*   This offer is still less than my outside offer. Let's increase my hold on item 5.\n\nWhat if I offered Player 1 [3, 5, 0, 5, 0]?\n\n*   This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 3 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 5 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 5 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n*   My value: (4 \\* 42) + (1 \\* 21) + (3 \\* 55) + (0 \\* 27) + (1 \\* 55) = 168 + 21 + 165 + 0 + 55 = 409\n\nLet's try one more. I'll offer Player 1 [3, 6, 0, 5, 1]\n\n*   This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 3 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 6 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 5 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 1 = 0\n*   My value: (4 \\* 42) + (0 \\* 21) + (3 \\* 55) + (0 \\* 27) + (0 \\* 55) = 168 + 0 + 165 + 0 + 0 = 333\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince all tested counteroffers have a total value less than my outside option, I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Therefore, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer. Since it's only round 1, I will make a counteroffer. I will try to get as much as I can while leaving player 1 with some value, hopefully above their outside offer. I should aim for at least my outside offer, accounting for the discount factor in future rounds. I need to offer Player 1 something they will accept.

The values may be close, depending on their item preferences.\n\nLet's offer Player 1: [0.5, 5, 1.5, 2, 1]. This would mean I keep: [0.5, 5, 1.5, 2, 1]\n\nMy value is 0.5*79 + 5*75 + 1.5*81 + 2*72 + 1*17 = 39.5 + 375 + 121.5 + 144 + 17 = 697.

Since this is the last round for making counteroffers, I will get my outside offer if the offer is rejected.

Therefore, a different strategy must be taken to ensure the counteroffer provides me with more than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven my outside offer is 1413, and any division must net me a higher value than this after considering discounting and negotiation dynamics, my decision should be:\n\nPropose a counteroffer that secures a value above 1413 or walk away if it's not feasible.\n\nTesting further iterations could be complex without actual offer alignment from player 2, so positioning an **optimal approach** would be:\n1. Make a minimal counteroffer that I can increase in following rounds if needed but retains upside.\n\nLet's try another division:\n\n- My new proposal:\n  - Offer Player 2:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 (value to me 43)\n    - 2 units of item 2 (value to me 172)\n    - 1 unit of item 3 (value to me 55)\n    - 1 unit of item 4 (value to me 65)\n    - 1 unit of item 5 (value to me 52)\n  - Remaining items for me:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 86\n    - 5 units of item 2 = 430\n    - 4 units of item 3 = 220\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 130\n    - 4 units of item 5 = 208\n\n**New Value Calculation**:\n- Total Value for Me = 86 + 430 + 220 + 130 + 208 = 1074\n\nThis value (1074) is still less than my outside offer of 1413, indicating that such direct divisions in initial round have hard trade-offs unless I assume future flexibility in either acceptance or discount rates.\n\nGiven the context and calculations suggesting offering maximizes potential returns, and walking stays too high unless other dynamics balance precipitously:\n\n**Decision**: Given the absence of a feasible initial offer and constrained context to meet my outside offer value:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 8 = 8\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 44 = 44\n      - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 22 = 22\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 84 = 84\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 3 = 3\n      - Total value of current offer: 8 + 44 + 22 + 84 + 3 = 161\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I want to get a value greater than 266. Also, giving more to Player 1 might lead them to accept.\n    - I have 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 in total. This means after giving player 1 n units of an item, I have (total units of item - n) units of each item for myself.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer is worth 161, which is less than my outside offer of 266.\n   - I should not accept the current offer.\n   - I should not walk away immediately because there are more rounds to make offers.\n   - I will make a counteroffer that I believe is beneficial to me.\n\nLet's calculate a reasonable counteroffer. I want to get at least 266 value.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1: [3, 5, 4, 2, 2]\nThis means for myself:\nItem 1: 4-3 = 1 * 8 = 8\nItem 2: 7-5 = 2 * 44 = 88\nItem 3: 6-4 = 2 * 22 = 44\nItem 4: 4-2 = 2 * 84 = 168\nItem 5: 3-2 = 1 * 3 = 3\nTotal value: 8+88+44+168+3 = 311\n\nThis offer gives me a total value of 311, which is larger than my outside option, so it is a good candidate.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 5, 4, 2, 2]}\n```",

This means that any deal in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 3, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 96) + (3 * 40) + (0 * 85) + (0 * 8) + (0 * 2) = 96 + 120 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 216.\n    *   Since 216 > 91, accepting the offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few counteroffer scenarios. To formulate counteroffers, I need to consider what Player 1's potential values might be. Since their values are also uniformly distributed between 1 and 101, it's reasonable to assume they value each item roughly in the middle (around 50). However, since this is Round 1, I might try to be a bit aggressive. I want to determine a counteroffer that is better for me than the outside option but still potentially attractive to the other player. Let's target a value of at least 101 for the other player.\n    *   If I offer them: [2, 3, 1, 1, 0], then I get nothing of any item.\n    Value to me is: (0 * 96) + (0 * 40) + (0 * 85) + (0 * 8) + (0 * 2) = 0. This is terrible!\n    *   If I keep [1, 3, 1, 1, 0], and give [1, 3, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1, then I will get 216.\n\n    *   My goal is to maximize my outcome. The current offer is pretty good with a value of 216. If I make a counteroffer, I risk not reaching an agreement and being forced to take my outside option of 91.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 216, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 91. Accepting it provides an immediate and substantial gain.\n*   Making a counteroffer introduces risk. Player 1 might reject it, and we could end up with no deal, forcing me to take my outside offer. Given that the current offer is already quite favorable, the potential gains from a counteroffer might not be worth the risk.\n\nTherefore, I will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, let's analyze the situation using the step-by-step guide provided.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 839.\n- **Values of the Items Involved**:\n  - Item 1: 60 per unit\n  - Item 2: 86 per unit\n  - Item 3: 31 per unit\n  - Item 4: 47 per unit\n  - Item 5: 22 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 4: 4 units\n  - Item 5: 7 units\n- **Discount Factor**: Since it is round 1, the discount factor (gamma) does not reduce the value yet. However, if the negotiation extends to the next rounds, the value will be multiplied by 0.9 to the power of (r-1), where r is the round number.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table, as negotiations just started.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - I want to propose a division where my value from the items exceeds my outside offer value (839) to justify not just walking away.\n  \nLet's calculate the total theoretical value of all items to me:\n- Item 1: 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n- Item 3: 6 \u00d7 31 = 186\n- Item 4: 4 \u00d7 47 = 188\n- Item 5: 7 \u00d7 22 = 154\n- **Total Value** = 300 + 172 + 186 + 188 + 154 = 1000\n\nNow, considering my outside offer is 839, I want to ensure that any counteroffer I propose to Player 2 provides me with a value greater than 839.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven the values, I want to draft a counteroffer where I still retain a high value, ideally surpassing 839, as my outside offer is relatively high. Since dividing items equally doesn't work due to unequal item counts and value, I'll construct a counteroffer focusing on items with less value impact to me, ensuring I keep items with higher per-unit value.\n\nHere's a proposed counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 0 units (I keep 5 for 300 value)\n  - Item 2: 1 unit (I keep 1 for 86 value)\n  - Item 3: 3 units (I keep 3 for 93 value)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (I keep 2 for 94 value)\n  - Item 5: 5 units (I keep 2 for 44 value)\n\nThis allocation gives me:\n- Item 1: 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n- Item 5: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n\nTotal value = 617\n\nThis doesn't exceed my outside offer, so let's make adjustments:\n- Let's modify the counteroffer to give Player 2 less of item 2 and more of other low-value items to me.\n\nFinal proposed counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 0 units (I keep 5 for 300 value)\n  - Item 2: 0 units (I keep 2 for 172 value)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (I keep 4 for 124 value)\n  - Item 4: 1 unit (I keep 3 for 141 value)\n  - Item 5: 5 units (I keep 2 for 44 value)\n\nFinal allocation gives me:\n- Item 1: 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n- Item 3: 4 \u00d7 31 = 124\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n- Item 5: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n\nNew Total value = 781\n\nThis still doesn't beat my outside offer, ensuring negotiations make sense. Let's revise further to give more low-value items to me:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit (I keep 4 for 240)\n  - Item 2: 0 units (I keep 2 for 172)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (I keep 4 for 124)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (I keep 2 for 94)\n  - Item 5: 4 units (I keep 3 for 66)\n\nRecalculate Total value to me:\n- Item 1: 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n- Item 3: 4 \u00d7 31 = 124\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n\nNew Total value = 696\n\nThis is less than the outside offer too. Hence not feasible without risking less value. Thus, due to the high outside offer value I hold, and attempting fair division retaining items yielding approx 839 or more is tight, a walk might be best safeguarding existing secure 839. GUILayout out of probable feasible options counteroffer better or inflate my hand. Lastly, but if unable, like:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 3, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 3, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 118\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 94, Item 2: 49, Item 3: 73, Item 4: 23, Item 5: 87\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 3, 0, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 94 = 94\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 49 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 73 = 219\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 23 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 87 = 87\n    *   Total value: 94 + 0 + 219 + 0 + 87 = 400\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 400 to me. My outside offer is 118. So, the current offer is significantly better than my outside option.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    *   Consider offering Player 1 half of each item I have, rounded to nearest integer.\n        *   Item 1: Player 1 gets 3, I get 2 (2 * 94 = 188)\n        *   Item 2: Player 1 gets 0, I get 0\n        *   Item 3: Player 1 gets 2, I get 1 (1 * 73 = 73)\n        *   Item 4: Player 1 gets 2, I get 2 (2 * 23 = 46)\n        *   Item 5: Player 1 gets 2, I get 1 (1 * 87 = 87)\n        *   My total value: 188 + 0 + 73 + 46 + 87 = 394\n    *   Consider offering Player 1 [3, 0, 1, 2, 2]. This means I get:\n        *   Item 1: 2 * 94 = 188\n        *   Item 2: 0 * 49 = 0\n        *   Item 3: 2 * 73 = 146\n        *   Item 4: 2 * 23 = 46\n        *   Item 5: 1 * 87 = 87\n        *   Total value: 188 + 0 + 146 + 46 + 87 = 467\n    *   If I offer Player 1 almost everything except for the bare minimum, I get:\n        *   Offer Player 1 [4, 0, 2, 3, 2]. This means I get:\n        *   Item 1: 1 * 94 = 94\n        *   Item 2: 0 * 49 = 0\n        *   Item 3: 1 * 73 = 73\n        *   Item 4: 1 * 23 = 23\n        *   Item 5: 1 * 87 = 87\n        *   Total Value = 94 + 0 + 73 + 23 + 87 = 277\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [1, 0, 3, 0, 1] is worth 400 to me, which is much greater than my outside option of 118. I could try to get more by making a counteroffer.\nIf I offer Player 1 [3, 0, 1, 2, 2] I get 467.\nHowever, the current offer is already pretty good, and there's a risk that Player 1 will walk away if I make a greedy counteroffer.\nSince it's Round 1, and the discount factor is 0.9, the potential gain from a slightly better offer might not be worth the risk of losing the deal.\n\nTherefore, I will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If negotiations conclude in later rounds, the value is multiplied by 0.9 or 0.9^2, respectively.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - As there is no current offer, I need to propose an offer.

Let's create an offer where I keep the more valuable items to me and offer less valuable portions to Player 2:\n\n   **Offer:**\n   - I offer Player 2: \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n\n   **My Kept Items:**\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 56 = 168\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 45 = 45\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 100 = 300\n   - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 100 = 400\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 25 = 75\n\n   **Total Value Retained = 168 + 45 + 300 + 400 + 75 = 988**\n\n   This value exceeds my outside offer of 972 and secures my position well above my threshold.\n\nConsidering this analysis, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 1, 3]}\n```",

This means I keep (5-x1) of item 1, (3-x2) of item 2, (3-x3) of item 3, (5-x4) of item 4, (6-x5) of item 5. I need to ensure x1 <= 5, x2 <= 3, x3 <=3, x4 <= 5, and x5 <=6, because these are the available number of items.\nMy value from a counteroffer is (5-x1)\\*100 + (3-x2)\\*41 + (3-x3)\\*62 + (5-x4)\\*68 + (6-x5)\\*80.\nI want this value to be greater than 1180.\n\nLet's see if I can get close to my ideal outcome while ensuring Player 1 receives something of value. My ideal would be giving Player 1 nothing, but that is unlikely to be accepted.\n\nI want to keep most of item 1 and item 5 since they are the most valuable to me. Suppose I offer them 2 of item 1 and 2 of item 5 and give them half of the other ones so they think its fair.\nMy offer would be [2, 1, 1, 2, 2].\nMy value would be (5-2)*100 + (3-1)*41 + (3-1)*62 + (5-2)*68 + (6-2)*80 = 300+82+124+204+320 = 1030.\nThe other player would likely reject this, so let me try another offer.\n\nLet me calculate my value if I give them everything else and keep only the maximum of item 1 for myself. So, I offer them [4,3,3,5,6].\n\nThen I get 1*100 + 0*41 + 0*62 + 0*68 + 0*80 = 100, which is less than 1180. I need to give them less.\n\nLet me make a different counteroffer.\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 972. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 978 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Certainly! Let's analyze the current situation and systematically work through it step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **My outside offer value** is 972.\n   - **My values per unit of each item:**\n     - Item 1: 56\n     - Item 2: 45\n     - Item 3: 100\n     - Item 4: 100\n     - Item 5: 25\n   - **The total pool of items:**\n     - 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - **Discount factor (gamma):** At round 2, the discount factor is \\(0.9^{2-1} = 0.9\\). This means any value I gain is multiplied by 0.9 to determine the present value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer to me: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]**\n     - Total value = \\(1 \\times 56 = 56\\)\n     - Present value = 56 * 0.9 = 50.4\n   - **My outside offer:** 972\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n     - Let's calculate the value if I keep a significant portion while leaving Player 2 with some items:\n     - Example Offer: I counteroffer [1, 1, 2, 2, 3] (offering them [4, 2, 1, 3, 3])\n       - Calculate value for me if I keep [4, 2, 1, 3, 3]:\n         - Item 1: 4 units = 4 \\* 56 = 224\n         - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \\* 45 = 90\n         - Item 3: 1 unit = 1 \\* 100 = 100\n         - Item 4: 3 units = 3 \\* 100 = 300\n         - Item 5: 3 units = 3 \\* 25 = 75\n       - My total value from this division = 789\n       - Present value = 789 * 0.9 = 710.1\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives a value of 50.4 after discount, which is way below my outside offer of 972.\n   - The sample counteroffer scenario gives a value of 710.1 after discount, still below my outside offer.\n   - Given these computations, **proposing a counteroffer that maximizes my value without crossing into risky rejection territory is crucial**. I should aim to keep my total value as high as possible while yielding enough so Player 2 may accept. Let's try an offer that allows them enough value while maximizing mine.\n\nCounteroffer decision: I want to keep my share of high-value items (item 3 and 4) while sharing others fairly:\n\nI propose a counteroffer offering Player 2 [3, 1, 1, 1, 4], leaving for me [2, 2, 2, 4, 2].\n\n- Expected value from this counter for me (pre-discount):\n  - Item 1: 2 \\* 56 = 112\n  - Item 2: 2 \\* 45 = 90\n  - Item 3: 2 \\* 100 = 200\n  - Item 4: 4 \\* 100 = 400\n  - Item 5: 2 \\* 25 = 50\n  - Total = 852\n  - Present value = 852 * 0.9 = 766.8\n\nSince this value is less than my outside offer value, it is still a more rational decision given that it is a risky negotiation, but it pushes the value further than the current offer. Ultimately, walking may yield the best outcome if negotiations don't improve dramatically in final rounds.\n\n**Since expected counteroffer value lower than the guaranteed outside offer, I will WALK away.**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 52. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1164 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision regarding the current negotiation, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 52.\n   - My private values per unit for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 78\n     - Item 2: 99\n     - Item 3: 47\n     - Item 4: 77\n     - Item 5: 87\n   - Total pool of items: [3, 3, 3, 1, 3]\n   - Current offer on the table: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (not offering me anything)\n   - Discount factor (gamma) influences future offers by reducing their value. The longer the negotiation, the less the final value due to the discount.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Accepting current offer: Since Player 2's offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], accepting gives me 0 value, which is worse than my outside offer (52).\n   - Counteroffer consideration:\n     - Let me consider making a balanced counteroffer where I value the items appropriately against my outside option.\n     - If I offer Player 2 [1, 1, 2, 0, 1], I keep [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]:\n       - Value to me is: \n         - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n         - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n         - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n         - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n         - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n       - Total value = 652\n       - Adjusted value with discount (round 2, gamma = 0.9): 652 \u00d7 0.9 = 586.8\n   \n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Should I accept? No, the current offer gives me 0 value.\n   - Should I walk away? Not yet, as a deal could provide more value than the outside offer.\n   - Should I propose a specific counteroffer? Yes, propose a deal where I get substantial items.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a counteroffer to maximize my value compared to the zero-valued current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

This means any deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]. This means I get:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 13 = 13\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 46 = 46\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 61 = 122\n      - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 62 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 79 = 79\n      - Total value of current offer: 13 + 46 + 122 + 0 + 79 = 260\n      - Discounted value of current offer (round 2): 260 * 0.9 = 234\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:**  234 (discounted value of accepting) < 591 (outside offer).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to decide if I should make a counteroffer, and what that would be. I have the following items:\n      - Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n      - Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n      - Item 3: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n      - Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n      - Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n\n   If I were to accept, I get a value of 234. So, I need to make a counteroffer that gets me more than 591. Since this is round 2, a deal must be struck that is worth at least 591/0.9 = 656.67 to me.\n\n   - **Counteroffer Construction:** I want to keep as much of items 3, 4, and 5 as possible because they are the most valuable to me. Let's see what the value is of giving the other player all of items 1 and 2: \n       - Keep all items 3, 4, and 5: 3 * 61 + 1 * 62 + 3 * 79 = 183 + 62 + 237 = 482\n       - Give the other player all items 1 and 2: 3 * 13 + 3 * 46 = 39 + 138 = 177\n       - 482 + 177 = 659 = total value\n\n  To get slightly more than my outside offer, let's create a counteroffer that gives away all of item 1 and all of item 2.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is not good enough.\n   - Walking away guarantees me 591.\n   - I will make a counteroffer to try and get more than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that getting a deal later is worth less than getting a deal now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]. This means they give me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept:\n        *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 6 = 0\n        *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 90 = 0\n        *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 77 = 0\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 18 = 36\n        *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 96 = 192\n        *   Total value = 0 + 0 + 0 + 36 + 192 = 228\n\n*   Comparison to outside offer: 228 < 521. Accepting the current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to consider what a good counteroffer would be. My goal is to get a deal worth more than 521. If I can't get that, I should walk away. I will try to get at least my outside offer.\n\nLet me calculate the value if I kept all the items:\n2 * 6 + 3 * 90 + 2 * 77 + 5 * 18 + 2 * 96 = 12 + 270 + 154 + 90 + 192 = 718\n\nSince the current offer is very low, and my total potential value from the negotiation is 718, I should aim for something around (718 + 521) / 2 to split the difference. That means roughly aiming for a value of around 620.\nI need to retain items with high value, so I would like to keep items 2, 3, and 5 as much as possible, while giving item 4 to the opponent.\n\nI will propose to keep all item 2, all item 5, all item 3. Give the opponent all the items 1, and all items 4.\nThis will offer the player 2, 0, 0, 5, 0.\nThat way I get all of the items 2, 3, and 5, resulting in a value of\n3*90 + 2*77 + 2*96 = 270 + 154 + 192 = 616.\nThis is more than my outside value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable.\n*   Walking away is an option, but I should try to get a better deal first.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that gives the opponent a better share of the items, but still ensures I get at least my outside offer value, taking into account the discount factor.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 5, 0]}\n```",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 112.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1: 70, item 2: 21, item 3: 90, item 4: 46, item 5: 57.\n*   The total pool of items is: 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its face value. Waiting could be beneficial if I can get a significantly better offer, but it also carries the risk of ending up with my outside option.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is that I receive [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 21 = 21\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 90 = 90\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 46 = 46\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 57 = 57\n    *   Total value of current offer: 70 + 21 + 90 + 46 + 57 = 284.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 284 is significantly greater than my outside offer of 112.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since the current offer is already better than my outside offer, I should try to get an even better deal. I will calculate the value to me of making a counteroffer in which I keep all the items for myself.\n\n    * 5 units of item 1 = 5 * 70 = 350\n    * 6 units of item 2 = 6 * 21 = 126\n    * 5 units of item 3 = 5 * 90 = 450\n    * 6 units of item 4 = 6 * 46 = 276\n    * 2 units of item 5 = 2 * 57 = 114\n    * Total value = 350 + 126 + 450 + 276 + 114 = 1316\n\n    This is significantly higher than what the offer is currently worth. I can afford to give up some items. I will suggest an even split of items, and modify it so that I receive more value due to the differing amounts and valuations.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is much better than my outside offer, I shouldn't walk away. However, I believe I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer. Let's calculate a possible split of items: I will give Player 1 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\n\nThis will leave me with:\n    * 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 70 = 210\n    * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 21 = 63\n    * 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 90 = 270\n    * 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 46 = 138\n    * 1 units of item 5 = 1 * 57 = 57\n    * Total value = 210 + 63 + 270 + 138 + 57 = 738\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer and better than the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 3, 1]}\n```",

Ideally, I want my total value to be more than 371.\n\n3) Making a Decision:\n   - Given there is no current offer, I should make an initial offer that maximizes my potential value while still considering the need for potentially attractive offers to Player 2.\n\n   - Let's start with a counteroffer keeping in mind a fair division might include proposing that Player 2 get fewer high-value items according to my valuations. For fairness and potential future negotiation, I should perhaps initially offer something reasonably equitable but in my favor:\n     - Offer Player 2: [3, 4, 0, 1, 0] (allocations for items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively)\n     - Retain: [3, 2, 1, 2, 0]\n   \n   Calculating the value to me for this retained division:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 51 = 153\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 26 = 52\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 68 = 68\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 13 = 26\n\n   Total value = 153 + 52 + 68 + 26 = 299\n\nConsidering this is below the outside offer value of 371, I need a more favorable counteroffer. I will retain more of the valuable items:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [2, 3, 0, 1, 0] (allocations for items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively)\n- Retain: [4, 3, 1, 2, 0]\n\nRecalculating the retained value:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 51 = 204\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 26 = 78\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 68 = 68\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 13 = 26\n\n   Total value = 204 + 78 + 68 + 26 = 376\n\nThis value of the retained items (376) now exceeds my outside offer of 371.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 698.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 54, item 2 = 71, item 3 = 76, item 4 = 59, item 5 = 45.\n*   The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 3, 0, 1, 0]. This means:\n    *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 54 = 108\n    *   3 units of item 2 = 3 * 71 = 213\n    *   0 units of item 3 = 0 * 76 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 59 = 59\n    *   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 45 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer = 108 + 213 + 0 + 59 + 0 = 380\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (380) is much less than my outside offer (698).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** To figure out a good counteroffer, let's first calculate the maximum I could possibly get. This would be if I took all items:\n    *   6 units of item 1 = 6 * 54 = 324\n    *   6 units of item 2 = 6 * 71 = 426\n    *   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 76 = 76\n    *   3 units of item 4 = 3 * 59 = 177\n    *   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 45 = 0\n    *   Total possible value = 324 + 426 + 76 + 177 + 0 = 1003\n\n    Since I need more than 698, let's try to construct an offer where I get at least that much value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is not good. I want to make a counteroffer. Since it's the first round, I can afford to be a bit aggressive in my counteroffer. Let's offer Player 1 just a little bit more than what I was offered. I want to retain most of items 2 and 3 as those are my best items.\nLet's offer Player 1 [3, 3, 0, 1, 0]. This would leave me with\n*   3 units of item 1 = 3 * 54 = 162\n*   3 units of item 2 = 3 * 71 = 213\n*   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 76 = 76\n*   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 59 = 118\n*   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 45 = 0\n    Total value = 162 + 213 + 76 + 118 = 569\n\nThat is still low. Let's try [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nThis leaves me with:\n* 5 units of item 1 = 5 * 54 = 270\n* 5 units of item 2 = 5 * 71 = 355\n* 1 units of item 3 = 1 * 76 = 76\n* 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 59 = 177\nTotal = 878.\n\nThis counteroffer looks better.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 698\n*   Item values: Item 1 = 54, Item 2 = 71, Item 3 = 76, Item 4 = 59, Item 5 = 45\n*   Total items: 6 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [3, 3, 0, 1, 0].\n    *   Value = (3 * 54) + (3 * 71) + (0 * 76) + (1 * 59) + (0 * 45) = 162 + 213 + 0 + 59 + 0 = 434\n    *   Discounted value = 434 * 0.9^(2-1) = 434 * 0.9 = 390.6\n*   Since 390.6 < 698, accepting is worse than walking away.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    I need to consider what Player 1 values the items at, to determine a reasonable counteroffer. Also I would need to keep the total value for me greater than my outside offer value of 698. I should offer only a small amount of the items I value highly, and a large amount of the items I value less.\n    Let's try to find a deal where I get more than my outside option. Suppose I give player 1 [4, 4, 1, 2, 0]. This would leave me with [2, 2, 0, 1, 0]. \n    The discounted value of this would be ((2 * 54) + (2 * 71) + (0 * 76) + (1 * 59) + (0 * 45)) * 0.9 = (108 + 142 + 0 + 59 + 0) * 0.9 = (309) * 0.9 = 278.1\n    Suppose I give player 1 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This would leave me with [5, 5, 1, 3, 0].\n    The discounted value of this would be ((5 * 54) + (5 * 71) + (1 * 76) + (3 * 59) + (0 * 45)) * 0.9 = (270 + 355 + 76 + 177 + 0) * 0.9 = (878) * 0.9 = 790.2\n    Since 790.2 > 698 I could offer a deal like this. However, Player 1 already has [3, 3, 0, 1, 0] so to make a deal, I need to offer them something they prefer over this. \n    To make this appealing to them, I should increase item 2 which I value highly and they value highly. \n    Lets offer [2, 2, 0, 0, 0] as a counteroffer. This would leave me with [4, 4, 1, 3, 0]\n    The discounted value of this would be ((4 * 54) + (4 * 71) + (1 * 76) + (3 * 59) + (0 * 45)) * 0.9 = (216 + 284 + 76 + 177 + 0) * 0.9 = (753) * 0.9 = 677.7\n    This is less than my outside option, so this is not good.\n\nLet's offer something to make the game end here. \nCounteroffer [0,0,0,0,0] would give me [(6 * 54) + (6 * 71) + (1 * 76) + (3 * 59) + (0 * 45)] * 0.9 = (324 + 426 + 76 + 177 + 0) * 0.9 = 1003 * 0.9 = 902.7\n\nSince 902.7 is higher than 698, it is a worthwhile offer for me to offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 offered me [2,2,2,2,2]. That leaves them with [3,2,1,0,1].\n    My total value is 66*5 + 59*4 + 70*3 + 93*2 + 68*3 = 330+236+210+186+204 = 1166.\n    If I get everything I would have 1166, if I accept the current offer I have 712, and my outside offer is 898.\n    Let's consider a counter offer of [1,1,0,0,0]. This is not too generous, and gives Player 1 1*66 + 1*59 = 125 + 59 = 125\n    If Player 1 accepts this, it means I get [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], so my value would be:\n    4*66 + 3*59 + 3*70 + 2*93 + 3*68 = 264 + 177 + 210 + 186 + 204 = 1041.\n    Let's offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1, since this is greater than my outside offer of 898.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable as it's less than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away guarantees my outside offer of 898.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that is potentially acceptable to Player 1 and exceeds my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 2, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 66 = 198\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 59 = 118\n     - 0 units of item 3: 0 * 70 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 93 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 68 = 68\n     - Total value of current offer: 198 + 118 + 0 + 0 + 68 = 384\n     - Discounted value of current offer: 384 * 0.9 = 345.6\n   - **Value of outside offer:** 898\n   - **Previous Round Offer:** My previous counteroffer to Player 1 was [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. That would have left me with 4 of item 1 (4 * 66 = 264), 3 of item 2 (3 * 59 = 177), 3 of item 3 (3 * 70 = 210), 2 of item 4 (2 * 93 = 186), and 3 of item 5 (3 * 68 = 204). That would have resulted in a value for me of 264 + 177 + 210 + 186 + 204 = 1041. Discounted, that would have been a value of 1041 * 1.0 = 1041 at the time.\n\n   - **Possible better offer for me:** If I could get all of item 3 and all of item 4, that would be 3 * 70 + 2 * 93 = 210 + 186 = 396 in value before the discount. That's higher per item than items 1, 2, or 5. Let's try to offer Player 1 my items 1 and 2 back. A potential counteroffer might be to give Player 1 [2, 1, 0, 0, 0], which would leave me with [3, 3, 3, 2, 3]. This has a value of 3 * 66 + 3 * 59 + 3 * 70 + 2 * 93 + 3 * 68 = 198 + 177 + 210 + 186 + 204 = 975. Discounted, that's worth 975 * 0.9 = 877.5\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   - The current offer is worth 345.6, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 898.\n   - I should not accept the current offer.\n   - My previous offer of [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1 would leave me with [4, 3, 3, 2, 3].\n   - A counteroffer of [2, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1 would leave me with [3, 3, 3, 2, 3], valued at 877.5. This is also lower than my outside option, but it's higher than the current offer to me, so I might want to try this offer if I have to, instead of walking away. However, it's the last round, so this would be treated as a walk anyway.\n   - Since it's the last round, making a counteroffer is the same as walking away. The current discounted offer is 345.6, my outside option is 898. I should walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

                    "response": "To decide my action, let's analyze the current situation using the provided step-by-step questions:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1367.\n   - My private values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 16 per unit\n     - Item 2: 59 per unit\n     - Item 3: 85 per unit\n     - Item 4: 42 per unit\n     - Item 5: 83 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, influences the value of accepting the deal over multiple rounds. The immediate value is not discounted this round as it is round 1.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer. I need to propose an initial offer.\n   - My goal is to propose an offer that, if accepted by Player 2, ensures I get a value greater than my outside offer of 1367.\n\nTo prepare a reasonable offer:\n   - Let's explore a division where I attempt to maximize my value while still giving Player 2 some items.\n   - Calculate the following counteroffer:\n     - Offer 1 unit of item 1, keeping 3 for myself.\n     - Offer 1 unit of item 2, keeping 2 for myself.\n     - Offer 3 units of item 3, keeping 3 for myself.\n     - Offer 1 unit of item 4, keeping 2 for myself.\n     - Offer 3 units of item 5, keeping 3 for myself.\n\n   Value Calculation for my portion (keeping):\n   - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 16 = 48\n   - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 59 = 118\n   - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 85 = 255\n   - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 42 = 84\n   - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 83 = 249\n   - Total value = 754\n\nSince 754 is far below my outside offer value of 1367, the approach should be adjusted to maximize my return closer to the outside offer:\n\nAdjust the offer by keeping a majority of the most valuable items like item 3 and item 5:\n\nOffer more units of lower-value items to Player 2 while retaining high-value items:\n\n   - New Offer Calculation:\n     - Offer 3 units of item 1, keeping 1 for myself.\n     - Offer 3 units of item 2, keeping 0 for myself.\n     - Offer 2 units of item 3, keeping 4 for myself.\n     - Offer 3 units of item 4, keeping 0 for myself.\n     - Offer 2 units of item 5, keeping 4 for myself.\n\n   Value Calculation for my updated portion (keeping):\n   - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 16 = 16\n   - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 59 = 0\n   - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 85 = 340\n   - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 42 = 0\n   - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 83 = 332\n   - Total value = 688\n\nAgain, this new offer is unfavorable as it does not approach my outside offer value of 1367.\n\nConsider offering a strategic middle ground that serves as an initial position and may be used for negotiation leverage with high-valued targets:\n\n   Proposed FINAL Counteroffer:\n     - Offer 2 units of item 1 (keep 2)\n     - Offer 2 units of item 2 (keep 1)\n     - Offer 0 units of item 3 (keep 6)\n     - Offer 2 units of item 4 (keep 1)\n     - Offer 1 unit of item 5 (keep 5)\n\n   My Value:\n   - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 16 = 32\n   - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 59 = 59\n   - Item 3: 6 units \u00d7 85 = 510\n   - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 42 = 42\n   - Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 83 = 415\n   - Total value = 1058\n\nThis positioning needs to be reiterated for recalibration towards a realistic figure for negotiating an opening bid since it is still below my desired threshold which should be arranged with returning a near but sustainable figure relative to the outside offer. Given the gap in value:\n\nFinal Adapted Counteroffer:\n - Offer 0 units of item 1 (keep 4)\n - Offer 3 units of item 2 (keep 0)\n - Offer 0 units of item 3 (keep 6)\n - Offer 3 units of item 4 (keep 0)\n - Offer 1 units of item 5 (keep 5)\n\n   Calculating New value:\n   - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 16 = 64 \n   - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 59 = 0\n   - Item 3: 6 units \u00d7 85 = 510\n   - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 42 = 0\n   - Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 83 = 415\n   - Total value = 989\n\nEven though the value is ultimately less, I need to purposefully initiate this as a point of aggressive wrangling thereby maximize from the differential:\n\nThus the final aggressive stance could be directed alternatively with:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]}",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]. This means Player 1 is offering me all 6 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer is 6 * 36 = 216.\n    *   This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 832.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer might look like. My goal is to get a deal worth more than 832.\n\n*   Comparison to outside offer: I need any offer I accept, or any outcome from a counteroffer, to be worth more than 832 (taking into account the discount factor in later rounds).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 216, which is far less than my outside offer of 832. Therefore, I should not accept the current offer.\n\nI believe I can get more than 832. I am going to propose a counteroffer that gives player one almost all items, keeping only items 3 and 4.\n\nHere's how I'll structure my counteroffer: I will offer player 1 all of item 1 (4 units), all of item 2 (3 units), and all of item 5 (6 units). I will offer player 1 zero units of item 3 and zero units of item 4.\n\nMy value for this counter offer is: (6 * 60) + (3 * 66) = 360 + 198 = 558\n\nThis is worth less than my outside offer. I need to keep more for myself. I will offer player 1 all the item 1 and item 2 items, half the item 3 items, none of item 4, and half of item 5. So, 4 item 1, 3 item 2, 3 item 3, 0 item 4, and 3 item 5\n\nMy value would be: (3 * 60) + (3 * 66) + (3 * 36) = 180 + 198 + 108 = 486\n\nThis is still lower than my outside offer. I'm going to make a slightly aggressive counteroffer.\n\nI will offer player 1 all the units of items 1 and 2. Then, I will offer them one unit of item 3, and all the units of item 5. I will keep all units of item 4 for myself.\n\nMy value is: (5 * 60) + (3 * 66) = 300 + 198 = 498\nValue is: (4 * 45) + (3 * 12) + (6 * 36) = 180 + 36 + 216 = 432\nTotal values of all items is 4 * 45 + 3 * 12 + 6 * 60 + 3 * 66 + 6 * 36 = 180 + 36 + 360 + 198 + 216 = 990\n990 - 432 = 558\n\nI will give them: 4, 3, 1, 0, 6\nI will get: 0, 0, 5, 3, 0\nMy value: 5 * 60 + 3 * 66 = 300 + 198 = 498\n\nStill low! I need 832.\nLet me try: 0, 0, 2, 0, 2\nMy value is: 4 * 45 + 3 * 12 + 4 * 60 + 3 * 66 + 4 * 36 = 180 + 36 + 240 + 198 + 144 = 798\nStill low!\n\nLet me give them: 0, 0, 1, 0, 1\nMy value is: 4 * 45 + 3 * 12 + 5 * 60 + 3 * 66 + 5 * 36 = 180 + 36 + 300 + 198 + 180 = 894\n\nOkay I'm going to offer 0, 0, 1, 0, 1\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 991\n   - Values of the items: item 1 = 61, item 2 = 26, item 3 = 77, item 4 = 56, item 5 = 1\n   - Total pool of items: 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now. Specifically, an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 1, 2, 2, 0]. This means I receive 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value for this offer is:\n      - 2 * 61 + 1 * 26 + 2 * 77 + 2 * 56 + 0 * 1 = 122 + 26 + 154 + 112 + 0 = 414\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 414 to me. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 991. Therefore, I shouldn't accept it immediately.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find an offer that is worth at least 991/0.9 = 1101.11 to Player 1, so that accepting that offer is at least as good as walking.\n\nLet's evaluate some potential counteroffers. I want to keep as much of item 3 as possible and give away the least valuable item 5 as much as possible, as well as item 2.\nCurrent offer to me: [2, 1, 2, 2, 0]\nMeans player 1 gets: [4, 3, 2, 5, 1]\n\nA counteroffer where I get the majority of the valuable items (item 3 is most valuable to me).\nI give player 1: [3, 2, 1, 3, 1]. Then I get: [3, 2, 3, 4, 0]\nMy value is 3 * 61 + 2 * 26 + 3 * 77 + 4 * 56 + 0 = 183 + 52 + 231 + 224 = 690\nThis is worse than my outside offer, so not a good offer.\n\nI could give Player 1 less. Let's consider a counteroffer where I get close to my outside offer value. To do that, I will offer very little.\nI give player 1: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. Then I get [5, 3, 4, 6, 1]\nMy value is 5 * 61 + 3 * 26 + 4 * 77 + 6 * 56 + 1 = 305 + 78 + 308 + 336 + 1 = 1028\nThis is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   - The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n   - I've identified a counteroffer that gives me a value of 1028.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

However, initially, this is not a concern unless we reach later rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Since there is no current offer on the table, I will consider making an initial counteroffer.\n   - I need to propose a division where my value is greater than my outside offer of 744.\n\n   - Let\u2019s consider a potential distribution:\n\n     Offering:\n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n\n     This leaves me with:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 74 = 296\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n\n     Total value to me = 296 + 108 + 15 + 117 + 99 = 635\n\n     This value is still less than my outside offer of 744.\n\n   - Let\u2019s adjust to maximize my value:\n\n     Offering:\n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n\n     This leaves me with:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 74 = 296\n     - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 27 = 162\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n     - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n\n     Total value to me = 296 + 162 + 30 + 117 + 132 = 737\n\n     This value is closer but still below 744.\n\n   - Offering:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 0 units of item 5\n\n     This leaves me with:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222\n     - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 27 = 162\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n     - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 33 = 165\n\n     Total value to me = 222 + 162 + 30 + 117 + 165 = 696\n\n     Also still less than 744, but better balance.\n\n3) Decision:\n\n   Based on these calculations, it is clear that any reasonable offer I make right now is not exceeding my outside offer. If I were to come closer to 744 in value, I'd have to sacrifice significantly more items\n   to Player 2 in exchange for fewer items with high overall value. Hence, the investigating approach needs adjustment or else I just propose a walk away based on outside offer.\n\n   Reassessing once more for tight conditions, and from resource management perspective let's reconsider slightly:\n\n     Offering:\n     - 0 units of items 1\n     - 0 units of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n \n     If I reevaluate the above rounds I receive:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 74 = 296\n     - 7 units of item 2 = 7 \u00d7 27 = 189\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n\n   Value to me = 296 + 189 + 30 + 117 + 33 = 665\n\n   It shows having better sum reward but even though as initial offer I would still take trivial forward cause needs and demand needs fortune basis setting:\n\n    Ultimately, considering the value difference necessary for player 2 to concede, I will walk as it optimizes guaranteed rather than fluctuating sanction and time taken elements 'Albeit approximation' after values exceed acceptance barrier.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"} ",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1078\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 29, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 65, Item 4: 94, Item 5: 100\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n    *   Value of offer: (1 * 29) + (2 * 1) + (1 * 65) + (1 * 94) + (1 * 100) = 29 + 2 + 65 + 94 + 100 = 290\n\n*   **If I accept the current offer:** My value is 290. This is much lower than my outside offer of 1078.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1078. Since I want to maximize my value, I want to keep as much of items 3, 4 and 5 as possible since they have the highest values. Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 almost all of items 1 and 2. Also, since it is the first round, there is not yet a discount factor to consider.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is significantly below my outside offer. Accepting it would be a bad decision.\n*   Walking away guarantees me 1078.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer to try to get a better deal than my outside offer.\n\nLet's calculate a counteroffer. I will offer the following to Player 1:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 1 (1*29 = 29)\nItem 2: 2 (2*1 = 2)\nItem 3: 4 (4*65 = 260)\nItem 4: 4 (4*94 = 376)\nItem 5: 2 (2*100 = 200)\nTotal value: 29 + 2 + 260 + 376 + 200 = 867\n\nThis is less than the outside offer and therefore not acceptable.\n\nLet's try to calculate a different offer. I should give Player 1 as little as possible of Items 3, 4, and 5 to get as close to the outside offer as possible. I need to make sure that Player 1 will accept it though. I don't know what their values are, so I will assume they value all items equally. That would mean they want to receive the greatest number of items overall.\n\nSince there are 4+6+5+5+3 = 23 total items, and they offered me 1+2+1+1+1 = 6 items, the average number of items would be 23/2 = 11.5. Let me make a COUNTEROFFER that is close to that.\n\nLet me offer:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2\nTotal: 2+4+2+2+2 = 12\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 2 (2*29 = 58)\nItem 2: 2 (2*1 = 2)\nItem 3: 3 (3*65 = 195)\nItem 4: 3 (3*94 = 282)\nItem 5: 1 (1*100 = 100)\nTotal value: 58 + 2 + 195 + 282 + 100 = 637\n\nThis is still below my outside offer value of 1078, but it is more equitable and might be accepted by Player 1. I will go with this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 4, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide my action, I'll first evaluate the situation and then use this information to make an informed decision.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** 651\n- **Values of Items Involved:** \n  - Item 1: 28 per unit\n  - Item 2: 17 per unit\n  - Item 3: 64 per unit\n  - Item 4: 29 per unit\n  - Item 5: 87 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 6 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n- **Discount Factor:** The value of accepting an offer in round 2 (current round) is not discounted (only becomes relevant in round 3).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n#### Current Offer:\nThe current offer given to me is [2, 4, 2, 2, 2], meaning:\n- 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n- 4 units of Item 2 = 4 \u00d7 17 = 68\n- 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n- 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n- 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n\n**Total Value of Current Offer:** 56 + 68 + 128 + 58 + 174 = 484\n\n#### Comparison with Outside Offer:\n- My outside offer is worth 651, which is greater than the value of the current offer (484).\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\n- **Accept:** The current offer is worth 484, which is significantly less than my outside offer value of 651. Therefore, accepting the current offer is not favorable.\n  \n- **Walk Away:** As the current offer is less than my outside offer, walking away to secure 651 is a viable option.\n\n- **Counteroffer:** I need to propose a division of items so that the total value I receive is greater than 651. Let's make a counteroffer:\n\n  - Items to keep for myself ([3, 5, 4, 4, 1]):\n    - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n    - 5 units of Item 2 = 5 \u00d7 17 = 85\n    - 4 units of Item 3 = 4 \u00d7 64 = 256\n    - 4 units of Item 4 = 4 \u00d7 29 = 116\n    - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n\n  **Total Value of this Configuration:** 84 + 85 + 256 + 116 + 87 = 628\n\n   The current sum falls short at 628. Let me try allocating 0 units of item 5.\n\n   - Items to keep for myself ([3, 5, 4, 4, 0]):\n   **Updated Total Value of this Configuration:** 84 + 85 + 256 + 116 + 0 = 541\n\n  This division doesn\u2019t exceed my outside offer value either. I will need to make the toughest threshold and give up more of less valuable items.\n\n   - Items to keep for myself ([4, 4, 3, 3, 1]):\n   **Revised Total Value of this Configuration:** ((4 \u00d7 28) + (4 \u00d7 17) + (3 \u00d7 64) + (3 \u00d7 29) + (1 \u00d7 87)) = 112 + 68 + 192 + 87 + 87 = 546\n   \n   Still, I cannot offer as my total valuation falls below the benchmark of 651. Considering my failed efforts to meet the threshold efficiently and without effectual fair redistribution of items, I need a new approach or fallback strategy.\n\n- Considering that no practical counter permutations result in exceeding my standing outside offer of 651, WALK will likely secure a better fallback deal for now.\n\nMy action is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 304\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 50, Item 3: 81, Item 4: 42, Item 5: 36\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]. This means Player 1 is keeping: Item 1: 2, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 1.\n    My value for the current offer is:\n    (1 * 7) + (0 * 50) + (1 * 81) + (1 * 42) + (2 * 36) = 7 + 0 + 81 + 42 + 72 = 202\n\n    This offer is worth 202 to me.\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer (202) is less than my outside offer (304).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I want to find an offer that is better than my outside offer. I have Item 1: 2, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 1 to give to Player 1.\n\n    Let's consider giving Player 1: [2, 1, 1, 3, 1]. This means I keep: Item 1: 1, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 2. The value of what I keep would be: (1 * 7) + (0 * 50) + (1 * 81) + (1 * 42) + (2 * 36) = 7+0+81+42+72 = 202. This is way below the outside offer.\n    Let's consider giving player 1 minimum amounts. I want to get closer to my outside offer. Since I have to offer something, let me try to give the items I value the least.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That means I keep everything. Which would give me 7*3 + 50*1 + 81*2 + 42*4 + 36*3 = 21+50+162+168+108 = 509. This will never be possible.\n\n    Instead, I will propose a counteroffer to capture most of the value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it. My goal is to propose a counteroffer that gives me more than my outside offer value.\n\nI will create a counteroffer where I receive more value. I can afford to give a bit to Player 1 while still coming out ahead. Let's consider giving Player 1 slightly more than their original offer. I will offer them: [2, 1, 2, 3, 2]. This means that I would keep Item 1: 1, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 1.\nMy value would be: 1 * 7 + 0 * 50 + 0 * 81 + 1 * 42 + 1 * 36 = 7 + 0 + 0 + 42 + 36 = 85. This offer is terrible. I must make a much more favorable counteroffer to myself.\n\nGiven the need to improve my value significantly compared to the outside offer, I will offer Player 1 [2, 0, 1, 3, 2]. This gives me Item 1: 1, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 1. The value to me is 1 * 7 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 81 + 1 * 42 + 1 * 36 = 7 + 50 + 81 + 42 + 36 = 216. That is still lower than the outside offer.\n\nLet's try giving Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]. I would keep Item 1: 2, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 2. That value to me is: 2*7 + 1*50 + 2*81 + 2*42 + 2*36 = 14 + 50 + 162 + 84 + 72 = 382. This is better than the outside offer, and gives enough to Player 1 that they might consider accepting.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

Since we're in round 2, any accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [1, 0, 0, 1, 3] means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 7) + (0 * 50) + (0 * 81) + (1 * 42) + (3 * 36) = 7 + 0 + 0 + 42 + 108 = 157\n    *   Discounted value: 157 * 0.9 = 141.3\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to determine if there's a counteroffer that's better than both my outside offer and the current offer. Let's consider keeping all the high-value items for myself.\n    If I keep all of items 2 and 3 and a large portion of the item 4, I'm likely to get good value.\n    The current offer gives Player 1 1 unit of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 3 units of Item 5. So my current share is: Item 1=2, Item 2=1, Item 3=2, Item 4=3, Item 5=0\nMy valuation is therefore: 2 * 7 + 1 * 50 + 2 * 81 + 3 * 42 + 0 * 36 = 14 + 50 + 162 + 126 + 0 = 352\n\n* Since the current offer would be worth 141.3 to me, I should at least match this offer.\n* Outside Offer = 304\n* Current potential share = 352 > 304, 141.3 so I should only ACCEPT if my share is valued greater than this, and I think I can get a better deal.\n\nLet's formulate a counteroffer. I want to get at least 304/0.9 = 337.77 to exceed my outside offer.\n\nI'll offer Player 1 a little more of the less valuable items.\nCounteroffer: [2, 0, 1, 3, 2] to Player 1.\nThis gives me:\nItem 1: 3-2 = 1 unit. Value = 7\nItem 2: 1-0 = 1 unit. Value = 50\nItem 3: 2-1 = 1 unit. Value = 81\nItem 4: 4-3 = 1 unit. Value = 42\nItem 5: 3-2 = 1 unit. Value = 36\nTotal Value = 7 + 50 + 81 + 42 + 36 = 216\n\nI will WALK if the other player offers me less than my outside option (which is 304).

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 400. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 930 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, I'll go through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 400.\n   - The values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 52\n     - Item 2: 34\n     - Item 3: 93\n     - Item 4: 38\n     - Item 5: 93\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - Item 1: 1 unit\n     - Item 2: 3 units\n     - Item 3: 5 units\n     - Item 4: 3 units\n     - Item 5: 2 units\n   - Since this is round 1, the discount factor does not yet affect my decision making, but I must keep in mind that future rounds will decrease my potential total value from any offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer on the table, so I will consider potential counteroffers.\n   - I need to keep enough of each item to ensure my total value from the negotiation exceeds 400 after accounting for potential future rounds.\n\nTo calculate my total value from different divisions, I'll consider a scenario where I maximize my total value, but still offer something to Player 2 to resolve the negotiation. A strategic offer could be:\n   - I offer Player 2 a minimal portion of lower-value items:\n     - Offer 0 unit of item 1\n     - Offer 2 units of item 2 (keeping 1 unit of item 2)\n     - Offer 2 units of item 3 (keeping 3 units of item 3)\n     - Offer 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 2 units of item 4)\n     - Offer 0 unit of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with the following for valuation:\n   - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n   - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n   - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n   - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n   - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n   - Total value = 627\n\n627 is > 400, which makes this a potentially acceptable counteroffer from my perspective.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - I will propose the calculated counteroffer since it gives me a higher value now. This counteroffer, while offering minimal units to Player 2, ensures I maximize my valuation above the outside offer. It also leaves ample room for further negotiation in future rounds if needed.\n\nHere is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 185. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, I'll analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation**:\n   - My outside offer value is 185.\n   - Values of the items for me:\n     - Item 1: 9\n     - Item 2: 25\n     - Item 3: 100\n     - Item 4: 26\n     - Item 5: 71\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 7 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means the value of the outcome decreases over each round. Since we are in round 1, the discount doesn't influence the current round's decision, but its effect would be significant in future rounds if we continue negotiating.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers**:\n   - There is no current offer, so I'll need to evaluate potential counteroffers.\n   - The strategy is to maximize my value. Proposing a counteroffer where Player 2 receives fewer high-value items helps with that, keeping the total over my outside offer value.\n\n3) **Value Calculation for My Items**:\n   - If I keep all items for myself, my total value is:\n     - \\(7 \\times 9 + 7 \\times 25 + 1 \\times 100 + 4 \\times 26 + 2 \\times 71 = 63 + 175 + 100 + 104 + 142 = 584 \\)\n\n4) **Make a Decision**:\n   - Since there's no offer from Player 2, I'll propose a counteroffer that allows me to achieve more than my outside offer value of 185.\n   - Suppose I propose 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, and keep all of items 3, 4, 5 for myself. \n     - Player 2 gets: \n       - \\(5 \\times 9 + 5 \\times 25 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 45 + 125 = 170 \\) (This is not enough value for me as 584 - 170 = 414, which is much higher than my outside offer value)\n   - Let's refine the offer to keep more value:\n     - I'll offer Player 2: 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n     - Value to me: \n       - I keep: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n       - \\(2 \\times 9 + 1 \\times 25 + 1 \\times 100 + 2 \\times 26 + 1 \\times 71 = 18 + 25 + 100 + 52 + 71 = 266 \\)\n   - This proposal gives me 266, which is greater than my outside offer of 185.\n\nThus, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 6, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

This means that waiting a round reduces the value of any deal by 10%.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [5, 6, 0, 2, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 38 = 190\n    *   6 units of item 2: 6 * 74 = 444\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 87 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 78 = 156\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 23 = 23\n    *   Total value of current offer: 190 + 444 + 0 + 156 + 23 = 813\n\n    Since 813 > 487, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *at this round*.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider what a fair split might look like, aiming for a value close to maximizing my outcome while also improving upon the initial offer. I want to keep as much of item 3 and item 2 as possible, and be reasonable on item 1 and 4.\n\n* **Compared to outside offer:** Accepting the current offer is better than my outside option.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 813, which is greater than my outside offer of 487. Therefore, I should not walk away. Let's explore a more favorable counteroffer.\n\nHere's a potential counteroffer: [2, 2, 0, 1, 0] for Player 1. This means I would keep:\n* Item 1: 7 - 2 = 5 units -> 5 * 38 = 190\n* Item 2: 7 - 2 = 5 units -> 5 * 74 = 370\n* Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 units -> 1 * 87 = 87\n* Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units -> 3 * 78 = 234\n* Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units -> 2 * 23 = 46\n\nTotal value = 190 + 370 + 87 + 234 + 46 = 927.\n\nSince waiting a round has a cost of 10% from the discount factor, lets provide a counteroffer that is better than accepting this current offer, as waiting is not preferable.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 6, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [4, 5, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 5, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 487\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1: 38, Item 2: 74, Item 3: 87, Item 4: 78, Item 5: 23\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer next round is worth 90% of what it's worth this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [4, 5, 0, 3, 1].  This means they get [3, 2, 1, 1, 1]. My value if I accept this offer is:\n    *   (4 \\* 38) + (5 \\* 74) + (0 \\* 87) + (3 \\* 78) + (1 \\* 23) = 152 + 370 + 0 + 234 + 23 = 779\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**  I need to consider potential counteroffers, but first, let's compare the current offer to my outside option and to the maximum possible value. The current offer of 779 exceeds my outside offer of 487. Now to see what my maximum possible value would be if I got all the items.\n    * (7 * 38) + (7 * 74) + (1 * 87) + (4 * 78) + (2 * 23) = 266 + 518 + 87 + 312 + 46 = 1229\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 779 is significantly better than my outside offer of 487. If I make a counteroffer and Player 1 accepts it in round 3, the value will be discounted by 0.9^1 = 0.9.\nLet's consider if there's a potential counteroffer that I could make and still do better than the current offer *after* taking into account the discount factor. I want to get as much value as possible, but I need to leave Player 1 with enough value that they would accept it.\n\nSince the current offer gives me a value of 779, I should accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Let me calculate the total value if I propose keeping most valuable items primarily.\n\n   - If I keep all items, I can calculate their total value:\n     - \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\) for item 1\n     - \\(4 \\times 90 = 360\\) for item 2\n     - \\(2 \\times 68 = 136\\) for item 3\n     - \\(4 \\times 16 = 64\\) for item 4\n     - \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\) for item 5\n     - Total = 24 + 360 + 136 + 64 + 33 = 617\n\n   - This value (617) without any division exceeds my outside offer (604). However, I need to propose a split that results in me having more or nearly as much for incentivizing an agreement over walking away:\n     - If I propose a 1 item reduction distribution to player 2 on lower value items to me (item 1 and item 5), and minimal on higher items:\n     - Propose: [2, 0, 1, 2, 2] -> Leave me with: [1, 4, 1, 2, 1]\n\n   - Resulting value:\n     - \\(1 \\times 8 = 8\\) for item 1\n     - \\(4 \\times 90 = 360\\) for item 2\n     - \\(1 \\times 68 = 68\\) for item 3\n     - \\(2 \\times 16 = 32\\) for item 4\n     - \\(1 \\times 11 = 11\\) for item 5\n     - Total = 8 + 360 + 68 + 32 + 11 = 479\n\n   - The value 479 is less than my outside offer and therefore not an acceptable initial distribution. Therefore reconsideratory alternative maximizing items 2, 3, as those hold higher calculated value as is sensible for counteroffering:\n     - Proposal: [3, 3, 2, 3, 3] -> Leave player 2 the least valuable distribution: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n     - All item 1 to me provides insufficient to every other alternative division.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Given the calculations, without compromising substantively on item 2 or 3 I don\u2019t might not procure favorable sufficient deal free of risk of counterproductive reciprocations. Also, thus walking away option (604) becomes less encumbered.\n\nThe action I will take: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 604. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 579 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

Therefore, I need to keep more of the items.\n\n   Let's adjust and consider a more favorable counteroffer:\n   - Offer Player 2:\n     - 0 units of item 1 (I keep 1)\n     - 1 unit of item 2 (I keep 3)\n     - 2 units of item 3 (I keep 5)\n     - 4 units of item 4 (I keep 5)\n     - 1 unit of item 5 (I keep 3)\n\n   Calculate the total value for me:\n   - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n   - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n   - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 76 = 380\n   - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n   - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 80 = 240\n   \n   Total value for me = 42 + 237 + 380 + 235 + 240 = 1134\n\n   This calculated value (1134) is still below my outside offer of 1556.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 5, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 5, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 1133.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 58, item 2 = 65, item 3 = 46, item 4 = 79, item 5 = 31.\n*   The total pool of items is: 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 2, 3, 5, 2].  This means:\n    *   0 units of item 1, value = 0 * 58 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 2, value = 2 * 65 = 130\n    *   3 units of item 3, value = 3 * 46 = 138\n    *   5 units of item 4, value = 5 * 79 = 395\n    *   2 units of item 5, value = 2 * 31 = 62\n    *   Total value of current offer = 0 + 130 + 138 + 395 + 62 = 725\n\n*   Since 725 is less than my outside offer of 1133, accepting this offer is not beneficial.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that would give me a value greater than 1133. I have the following items to allocate myself:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 7 - 3 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 9 - 5 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n\n    Therefore, if I offered nothing, I would have 1 * 58 + 2 * 65 + 4 * 46 + 4 * 79 + 2 * 31 = 58 + 130 + 184 + 316 + 62 = 750.\n\n    Let's think about a potentially good counteroffer. I want to offer Player 1 enough to make it worthwhile for them, but also keep enough for myself to beat my outside offer. I need to give up at least (750 - 1133 = -383) units of value, so giving up zero is a non-starter.\n\n    Consider this offer. Give Player 1 all of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    This means offering player 1: [1, 2, 4, 4, 2]. This leaves me with:\n        *Item 1: 0 units, value = 0\n        *Item 2: 2 units, value = 2 * 65 = 130\n        *Item 3: 3 units, value = 3 * 46 = 138\n        *Item 4: 5 units, value = 5 * 79 = 395\n        *Item 5: 2 units, value = 2 * 31 = 62\n    Total value = 0 + 130 + 138 + 395 + 62 = 725\n\n    Consider this offer. Give Player 1 zero items: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This leaves me with:\n        *Item 1: 1 units, value = 1*58 = 58\n        *Item 2: 4 units, value = 4 * 65 = 260\n        *Item 3: 7 units, value = 7 * 46 = 322\n        *Item 4: 9 units, value = 9 * 79 = 711\n        *Item 5: 4 units, value = 4 * 31 = 124\n    Total value = 58 + 260 + 322 + 711 + 124 = 1475. This is well over my outside offer.\n\n    Given the large gap between my current offer and my outside offer, and my estimate of a counteroffer where I keep everything and still beat my outside offer by a lot, I am going to make the \"keep all items\" counteroffer, which will probably lead to Player 1 accepting.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This implies that creating a favorable deal earlier is preferable.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Currently, there's no offer on the table to accept.\n   - Potential counteroffers need to ensure I receive a mix of items that provides a value higher than 1087 after considering the discount factor for round 1 (discount factor is less worrying in round 1, as it's 0.9^0 = 1).\n\n3) **Decision-Making:**\n   - Calculate optimal allocations to maximize my value:\n     - I need to balance my offer so that I reach at least 1087 in value to justify it over my outside offer.\n     - Try to retain high-value items primarily (items 3 and 4 due to their high individual value).\n\n   Let's calculate a potential counteroffer:\n\n   Retain at least:\n   - 3 units of item 1 (3 x 45 = 135)\n   - 4 units of item 2 (4 x 49 = 196)\n   - 5 units of item 3 (5 x 81 = 405)\n   - 1 unit of item 4 (1 x 51 = 51)\n   - 2 units of item 5 (2 x 25 = 50)\n\n   The value of keeping these:\n   135 (item 1) + 196 (item 2) + 405 (item 3) + 51 (item 4) + 50 (item 5) = 837\n\n   This isn't sufficient.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 798.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 83, item 2 = 8, item 3 = 88, item 4 = 14, item 5 = 26.\n*   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer gives me [0, 1, 2, 0, 3] units of items [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] respectively. This means Player 1 is offering me:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 units of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n\n    The value to me is: (0 * 83) + (1 * 8) + (2 * 88) + (0 * 14) + (3 * 26) = 0 + 8 + 176 + 0 + 78 = 262.\n    Since 262 < 798, this offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept but is still better than my outside offer. The total available quantities of items Player 1 must receive are [4-x1, 6-x2, 7-x3, 1-x4, 6-x5] where [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5] is the offer I provide to Player 1.\nLet's consider the possibility that Player 1 values Item 3, Item 1 the most.

Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any deal we make now is worth 90% of its undiscounted value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer gives me [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2. My value for this offer is (1 * 83) + (1 * 8) = 91.  Considering the discount factor, the present value is 91 * 0.9 = 81.9. This is much less than my outside offer of 798.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 798 / 0.9 = 886.67 (undiscounted value). This is the minimum undiscounted value I need to get for my counteroffer to be better than walking away.\n\n    Let's consider a scenario where I take almost everything and give the other player very little. Let's say I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would mean I get [4, 6, 7, 1, 6]. The value of this offer to me would be: (4 * 83) + (6 * 8) + (7 * 88) + (1 * 14) + (6 * 26) = 332 + 48 + 616 + 14 + 156 = 1166.\n\n    Let's consider giving the player 1 one unit of item 3 which is what I value most, giving them [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] leaving me with [4, 6, 6, 1, 6]. The value of this offer to me would be: (4 * 83) + (6 * 8) + (6 * 88) + (1 * 14) + (6 * 26) = 332 + 48 + 528 + 14 + 156 = 1078.\n\n    I need a undiscounted value of at least 886.67 from my share to beat walking away.\n    Now let us consider the first round offers to see if there is a way to meet in the middle.\n    Round 1 offer to me was: [0, 1, 2, 0, 3] with the counter offer [1, 2, 2, 0, 2] to Player 1\n    The first round offer was valued at (0 * 83) + (1 * 8) + (2 * 88) + (0 * 14) + (3 * 26) = 0 + 8 + 176 + 0 + 78 = 262\n    My counteroffer left me with [3, 4, 5, 1, 4] = 249 + 32 + 440 + 14 + 104 = 839 which is more than my walkaway but discounted at round 1 means I received 839*0.9 = 755.1\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I need to counteroffer to get a better deal than my outside offer. I am going to offer Player 1 a bit more to make it seem like they are winning, and hopefully, they will accept. I will give them one unit of item 3 which is what I value most, giving them [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] leaving me with [4, 6, 6, 1, 6]. The value of this offer to me would be: (4 * 83) + (6 * 8) + (6 * 88) + (1 * 14) + (6 * 26) = 332 + 48 + 528 + 14 + 156 = 1078. Discounted, this is 1078 * 0.9 = 970.2.\nThis is much greater than my walk away of 798.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I want to offer something that is better for me than walking away, and hopefully something Player 1 will accept, or at least something that will lead to a better offer in the final round. I have the following items:\n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 2 units\n     - Item 3: 4 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 4 units\n   My values: item 1: 30, item 2: 99, item 3: 36, item 4: 91, item 5: 52\n\n   I'm going to make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a good portion of the items, but still leaves me with more than my outside offer value after discounting. Let's aim to get close to my outside offer value after the discount of 0.9.\n\n   Let's propose offering Player 1 the following: [1, 1, 2, 3, 2]\n   This leaves me with: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n   My value: (1 * 30) + (1 * 99) + (2 * 36) + (2 * 91) + (2 * 52) = 30 + 99 + 72 + 182 + 104 = 487\n   Discounted value in round 2: 487 * 0.9 = 438.3. Still less than my discounted outside offer.\n\n   Okay, how about offering Player 1 a bit less? Let's try [0, 0, 1, 1, 1].\n   This leaves me with [2, 2, 3, 4, 3]\n   My value: (2 * 30) + (2 * 99) + (3 * 36) + (4 * 91) + (3 * 52) = 60 + 198 + 108 + 364 + 156 = 886\n   Discounted value: 886 * 0.9 = 797.4\n\n   This is better than my outside offer value.

Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 968, taking into consideration the discount factor in future rounds.\nLet's think about a possible \"fair\" split where I try to get most of the items that I value more highly and give the rest to Player 1.\n\nI highly value item 1 and item 5.\nPlayer 1 is offering me:\nItem 1: 2. That means he is keeping 3.\nItem 2: 0. That means he is keeping 1.\nItem 3: 4. That means he is keeping 5.\nItem 4: 0. That means he is keeping 1.\nItem 5: 3. That means he is keeping 3.\n\nI want a counteroffer where I keep more of items 1 and 5. I will try to offer a split that is roughly equal.\n\nI want to keep at least 4 of item 1 and 4 of item 5, and all of Item 4, while giving the rest to player 1. I will offer: [1,0,5,0,2]. This means I will receive [4,1,4,1,4].\n4 * 82 + 1 * 2 + 4 * 16 + 1 * 18 + 4 * 85 = 328 + 2 + 64 + 18 + 340 = 752\nThis is still not great.\n\nLet's try offering player 1 more of item 3, because I value it least. How about [0,0,7,0,0]?\nThis means I get [5,1,2,1,6]\n5 * 82 + 1 * 2 + 2 * 16 + 1 * 18 + 6 * 85 = 410 + 2 + 32 + 18 + 510 = 972.\nThis is greater than my outside offer, and is the best offer I can give Player 1 and still be above my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible.

Still less than my outside offer.\n\nGiven the discount factor and that my outside offer is relatively high, the chance of getting a beneficial deal is diminishing,\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is very bad. I've explored some counteroffers, and even very favorable ones do not exceed my outside offer after the discount factor. Since it is round 2, and it is unlikely that I will get a better deal, I will take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 0].  This means Player 1 receives: [4, 5, 2, 2, 5].

I want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 enough to make a deal worthwhile for them. Let's consider a counteroffer where I give the player a portion of each item. A good starting point might be dividing the items roughly in proportion to my and Player 1's assessment of them. However, I do not know the values of player 1 and therefore, it would be difficult to propose an efficient and acceptable offer, therefore I should start with the offer that benefits me the most.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly below my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1132. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 738 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1132\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 74, Item 3: 69, Item 4: 43, Item 5: 56\n*   **Total item pool:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [1, 2, 0, 2, 0] (offered to me). This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is: (1 \\* 4) + (2 \\* 74) + (0 \\* 69) + (2 \\* 43) + (0 \\* 56) = 4 + 148 + 0 + 86 + 0 = 238.  Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 238 * 0.9 = 214.2.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 214.2 is much less than my outside offer of 1132.\n\nNow, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to aim for a value that, even after discounting, is greater than 1132. Let's calculate the total value of all items: (5\\*4) + (6\\*74) + (3\\*69) + (6\\*43) + (5\\*56) = 20 + 444 + 207 + 258 + 280 = 1209.\nIf I get all items, my value is 1209.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 a minimal amount to try and secure a better deal for myself in round 3 if necessary. It seems Player 1 values items 1 and 4 based on their offers. Let's try offering Player 1 a similar amount to their current offer and see if we can get away with keeping almost everything.\n\nLet's give Player 1 [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]. This leaves me with [4, 4, 3, 4, 5].\nMy value: (4\\*4) + (4\\*74) + (3\\*69) + (4\\*43) + (5\\*56) = 16 + 296 + 207 + 172 + 280 = 971. 971 * 0.9 = 873.9. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's calculate how much I have to give away such that keeping the remaining items is more valuable than my outside offer. 1132/0.9 = 1257.78. This means I need to keep more than 1257.78 value. The full amount is 1209. This suggests that there may not be a satisfactory division possible in the final round.\n\nHowever, the negotiation history suggests that Player 1 might be willing to make an offer. The first offer was worse, and the second better. It may be worth making one last counteroffer to see if Player 1 continues to improve their offers.\n\nMy outside option is 1132. So, let's aim for more than that. If I give [2, 3, 1, 3, 2], my value is (3\\*4) + (3\\*74) + (2\\*69) + (3\\*43) + (3\\*56) = 12 + 222 + 138 + 129 + 168 = 669. Discounted, it's 669*0.9 = 602.1.\nIf I give [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], my value is 1209. Discounted, it's 1209*0.9 = 1088.1.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]. My value will be (4\\*4) + (4\\*74) + (3\\*69) + (4\\*43) + (5\\*56) = 16 + 296 + 207 + 172 + 280 = 971. Discounted = 971*0.9 = 873.9.\n\nIf I try giving away [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] my value is (5\\*4)+(5\\*74)+(3\\*69)+(5\\*43)+(5\\*56) = 20 + 370+207+215+280 = 1092. Discounted, 982.8.\n\nSince this is the second round, I'll make a reasonable counteroffer to try and improve the offer in the last round. I will counteroffer with [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and make a decision.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 370\n*   My values for items 1-5: 29, 43, 39, 32, 32\n*   Total items: 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 29 = 58\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 43 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 39 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 32 = 64\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 32 = 32\n    *   Total value of current offer: 58 + 0 + 0 + 64 + 32 = 154\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** 154 < 370, so accepting the current offer is worse than walking away immediately.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Let's calculate the value of keeping everything for myself. That's 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n    * 5 * 29 = 145\n    * 1 * 43 = 43\n    * 0 * 39 = 0\n    * 6 * 32 = 192\n    * 4 * 32 = 128\n    Total value = 145 + 43 + 0 + 192 + 128 = 508\n\n    If I offer Player 1 nothing, the total value is 508, which is better than my outside offer. So I should try to negotiate for something closer to that value.\n\n    If I offer player 1 half of each item.\n    * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 29 = 58\n    * 0 unit of item 2: 0.5 * 43 = 21.5\n    * 0 units of item 3: 0 * 39 = 0\n    * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 32 = 96\n    * 2 unit of item 5: 2 * 32 = 64\n    * Total value: 58 + 21.5 + 0 + 96 + 64 = 239.5\n\n    If I make the offer, I'll offer player 1 the following:\n    Item 1: 2\n    Item 2: 0\n    Item 3: 0\n    Item 4: 2\n    Item 5: 1\n\n    I'm not getting enough value from accepting the current offer. I should make a counteroffer to get a better deal. Given the circumstances, I want to propose an offer where I get a substantial share, resulting in value > outside offer. Let me provide an offer that will give them the bare minimum while ensuring I meet my goals.\n\n    I offer Player 1:\n    Item 1: 2\n    Item 2: 0\n    Item 3: 0\n    Item 4: 2\n    Item 5: 1\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nSince the current offer (154) is far below the outside offer (370), I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 641.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 77, item 2 = 33, item 3 = 73, item 4 = 62, item 5 = 32.\n*   The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 77 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 33 = 33\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 73 = 73\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 62 = 186\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 32 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 0 + 33 + 73 + 186 + 0 = 292\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 292, while my outside offer is 641.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\nI need to make an offer to Player 1. This offer must specify how many units of each item I will give to player 1. Since there are a total of 2 units of Item 1, if I offer Player 1 1 unit of item 1, I keep 1 unit of item 1. Let's consider an offer where I keep most of items and give Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 2, 0].\n    *   Player 1 gets 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n    *   I would get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   My total value: 1 * 77 + 1 * 33 + 1 * 73 + 3 * 62 + 1 * 32 = 77 + 33 + 73 + 186 + 32 = 401.\n\nIt is unlikely I can get much more value from Player 1, because the Player 1 probably wants to maximize their value as well.\n\nSo, if I accept this offer I will get 292 immediately. If I walk away I will get 641 immediately. Because 641 > 292, I should not accept the offer. Also, since my total value is 708, there is no outcome that I will have more than 641 * 0.9 = 576.9 in Round 2. This is better than 292.\nBut what about an offer where I give [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? In this case my total value is: 2 * 77 + 2 * 33 + 2 * 73 + 5 * 62 + 1 * 32 = 154 + 66 + 146 + 310 + 32 = 708. Player 1 gets 0.\n\nLet's try to improve the outcome. Let's make a counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]. My value would be 401.\n\nSince the current offer of 292 is much less than my outside offer of 641, I should not accept. I also can't come up with a better counteroffer, so I will walk.\n\n**Decision:** WALK\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since there are only 3 rounds, there's some incentive to secure a deal now. Let's consider a counteroffer where I try to get a large portion of items 3 and 4 since those have the highest per-unit values for me. My total value is (5*22) + (6*59) + (6*80) + (6*87) + (3*32) = 110 + 354 + 480 + 522 + 96 = 1562\n    I should try to get at least around 1467/1562 of the total pool.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 a relatively small amount of the items I value highly and more of items that I value less.\n    I'll give Player 1: [4, 5, 5, 5, 2]. This leaves me with:\n        * 1 unit of item 1 * 22 = 22\n        * 1 unit of item 2 * 59 = 59\n        * 1 unit of item 3 * 80 = 80\n        * 1 unit of item 4 * 87 = 87\n        * 1 unit of item 5 * 32 = 32\n        * Total value = 22 + 59 + 80 + 87 + 32 = 280. Which is very bad.\n\n    I need to leave myself more items. How about offer Player 1: [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   4 units of item 1 * 22 = 88\n    *   4 units of item 2 * 59 = 236\n    *   4 units of item 3 * 80 = 320\n    *   4 units of item 4 * 87 = 348\n    *   2 units of item 5 * 32 = 64\n    *   Total value = 88 + 236 + 320 + 348 + 64 = 1056. Still not good enough.\n\n    How about offer Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] This means I get:\n    *   5 units of item 1 * 22 = 110\n    *   5 units of item 2 * 59 = 295\n    *   5 units of item 3 * 80 = 400\n    *   5 units of item 4 * 87 = 435\n    *   3 units of item 5 * 32 = 96\n    *   Total value = 110 + 295 + 400 + 435 + 96 = 1336. Still not good enough.\n\n    Let's make a more aggressive counteroffer. Offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get everything:\n    *   5 units of item 1 * 22 = 110\n    *   6 units of item 2 * 59 = 354\n    *   6 units of item 3 * 80 = 480\n    *   6 units of item 4 * 87 = 522\n    *   3 units of item 5 * 32 = 96\n    *   Total value = 110 + 354 + 480 + 522 + 96 = 1562. This is greater than my outside offer!\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 102. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 297 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 1467.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 22, item 2 = 59, item 3 = 80, item 4 = 87, item 5 = 32.\n   - Total items: 5 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted next round is worth 90% of its value this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 5, 5, 5, 1]. This means:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 22 = 44\n      - 5 units of item 2: 5 * 59 = 295\n      - 5 units of item 3: 5 * 80 = 400\n      - 5 units of item 4: 5 * 87 = 435\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 32 = 32\n      - Total value of current offer: 44 + 295 + 400 + 435 + 32 = 1206\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 1206 < 1467. Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away right now.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what I could offer Player 1 that would be better than my outside offer, but still leave me with more than 1467 * 0.9 = 1320.3 next round. Since this is round 2, getting Player 1 to accept in round 3 is the only other option.\n\n   - Let's consider a scenario where I offer Player 1 almost everything, just enough to beat my outside offer with the discount in play.\n      - I have a total potential value of (5*22 + 6*59 + 6*80 + 6*87 + 3*32) = 1562\n      - Player 1 needs to get more than their outside offer/discount. We do not know the value of Player 1's outside offer, so it is difficult to model the ideal choice, but lets assume their outside offer is low and they need a decent chunk of the items to make the deal worthwhile to them.\n\n      - So, let me try offering Player 1 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n      - I would get:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 22 = 44\n      - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 59 = 118\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 80 = 160\n      - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 87 = 174\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 32 = 32\n      - This offer would give me 44+118+160+174+32=528.\n      - Which in round 3 would be 528 * 0.9 = 475.2.\n      - This is still much less than my outside offer of 1467.\n\nSince the current offer gives me a value less than my outside offer, and making a counteroffer may be risky since I do not know the outside offer of player 1, I should just take the guaranteed value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is worth 1206, which is less than my outside offer of 1467.\n   - Making a counteroffer seems difficult without knowing player 1's outside offer.\n   - Walking away guarantees my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1005.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1: 77, item 2: 39, item 3: 36, item 4: 40, item 5: 54.\n   - The total pool of items is: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that if I accept an offer in round 2, its value will be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.9^2 = 0.81. Therefore, a good offer now is better than a slightly better offer later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n      - This means I get 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n      - My value for this offer is: (2 * 77) + (2 * 39) + (2 * 36) + (1 * 40) + (2 * 54) = 154 + 78 + 72 + 40 + 108 = 452.\n   - **Comparing to outside offer:** The current offer value (452) is significantly less than my outside offer value (1005).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get if I make a counteroffer. I want to get a deal that is worth more than 1005, even after considering the discount factor if it takes more rounds.\n   \n   - **Let's consider a counteroffer where I take 3 of each item: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5, and offer the rest to Player 1.** This looks similar to the example from the prompt, so let's begin there as a starting point.\n        -3 units of item 1 = 3 * 77 = 231\n        -3 units of item 2 = 3 * 39 = 117\n        -2 units of item 3 = 2 * 36 = 72\n        -3 units of item 4 = 3 * 40 = 120\n        -3 units of item 5 = 3 * 54 = 162\n        -Total value = 231 + 117 + 72 + 120 + 162 = 702\n        -Given that our outside offer is 1005, this isn't likely to be accepted, and even if it were accepted in the next round, the discounted rate would likely make this offer even less attractive.\n\n    - **Now, let's consider making an offer that leaves Player 1 with very little.** Consider offering Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n       -This would leave me with everything. My total value would be 1154. Since this is greater than my outside offer, it is a good outcome.\n        -However, they would likely reject this offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is very bad compared to my outside option. Offering [0,0,0,0,0] is unlikely to be accepted and may be a waste of time. Therefore, the best action is to make a reasonable counteroffer and hope it is accepted.\n\nI'll try to make a counteroffer that gives me slightly more than half the value, assuming Player 1 values the items similarly to me. Let's aim for a deal where I get at least 60% of the total possible value and see how that works. This is somewhat tricky without knowing Player 1's value.\n\nLet's try the following. I keep 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n- Player 1 receives: 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\n- My value: (4 * 77) + (3 * 39) + (3 * 36) + (3 * 40) + (4 * 54) = 308 + 117 + 108 + 120 + 216 = 869.\nSince this is below the outside offer, let's increase my value by giving Player 1 a smaller offer and increasing our own take: I keep 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n-Player 1 receives: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\n- My value: (4*77)+(4*39)+(3*36)+(3*40)+(4*54) = 308 + 156 + 108 + 120 + 216 = 908\nStill not great. If I wanted to make sure that I get at least 1005 in the first round, I would need to take 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n\nAfter considering that player 1 will likely reject any offer that will give me more than my outside option, the most reasonable offer to me would be to take a bit more.\nGiven that the current offer to me is [2,2,2,1,2], a good counteroffer is where I receive just a bit more of everything, as a negotiation tactic. Let's try: Offer Player 1 [1,1,1,1,1]. This would be a good opening counter offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now. For example, an offer worth 700 this round is worth 700 * 0.9 = 630 next round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 2, 4, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n     My value for this offer is (0 * 77) + (0 * 78) + (2 * 40) + (4 * 95) + (1 * 3) = 0 + 0 + 80 + 380 + 3 = 463.\n     Since 463 is less than my outside offer of 672, accepting this offer is not beneficial at all.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I want to formulate a counteroffer where I get more value than my outside offer.\n     Let's consider a scenario where I demand everything except for a small amount of the less valuable items for Player 1. Since I have a high value for items 1, 2, and 4, I would want to keep as much as possible of those.\n\n     Let's see what happens if I give Player 1 [0, 0, 2, 2, 1]. This means I would get: 1 item 1, 2 item 2, 3 item 3, 4 item 4, and 2 item 5. My value would be:\n     (1 * 77) + (2 * 78) + (3 * 40) + (4 * 95) + (2 * 3) = 77 + 156 + 120 + 380 + 6 = 739.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   The current offer is bad (463 < 672). Proposing a counteroffer where I get 739 is good if I think Player 1 might accept that (or something close to it). Otherwise, I would rather walk away and take my outside option. I could try to be greedy and get something higher than 739, but the risk of walking away increases. I also need to account for the discount factor.\n\n   Let's propose the counteroffer [0, 0, 2, 2, 1]. This will give me a value of 739 this round, which is better than my outside option of 672.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 161.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 49, item 2 = 20, item 3 = 80, item 4 = 48, item 5 = 44.\n   - The total pool of items is: item 1 = 6, item 2 = 1, item 3 = 2, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1. Waiting could be beneficial if a much better offer is likely, but it also carries the risk of ending up with the outside offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [3, 1, 1, 2, 3]. This means Player 1 would get: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 0, item 3 = 1, item 4 = 2, item 5 = 2. I would get: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 0, item 3 = 1, item 4 = 2, item 5 = 2. My value for this offer is (3 * 49) + (0 * 20) + (1 * 80) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 44) = 147 + 0 + 80 + 96 + 88 = 411.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer might be. The other player has already offered me some items. Let's see if I can come up with an offer that is better for me than 411, but also reasonable to the other player. I want to aim for something better than my outside option too.\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value to me is 411, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 161.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.\n   - Before accepting, let's check what's the best possible outcome for me, and whether it is worth trying to get closer to it. I should try to give away the items I value less, while keeping the ones I value higher.\n   - I value items in this order: Item 3 > Item 1 > Item 4 > Item 5 > Item 2.\n   - The offer on the table gives me all of item 2, some of item 1, some of item 3, some of item 4, and some of item 5. Since the offer gives me a value of 411, which is already way better than my outside option of 161, I can consider accepting the offer.\n   - However, since this is round 1 and the other player's offer is reasonably generous, I could try to push for a better deal by making a counteroffer. Since the other player gave me all of Item 2, I could consider doing the same for one of the other low-value items. I will counteroffer giving the other player all of Item 5.\n   - My counteroffer will be: [6, 1, 2, 4, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 1, 2, 4, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

                    "response": "Sure, let's go through the steps systematically:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 703.\n   - My values per unit of items are:\n     - Item 1: 100\n     - Item 2: 38\n     - Item 3: 10\n     - Item 4: 66\n     - Item 5: 47\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.9, which affects the value of waiting by reducing the effective value of future negotiations by a factor of gamma for each additional round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to accept, so I need to consider potential counteroffers.\n   - To beat my outside offer value, I need any division of items where my total value exceeds 703.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on this analysis:**\n   - Since Player 2 has not made an offer yet, I need to make an initial offer.\n   - Consider an offer that maximizes my outcome above 703 easily.\n\n   Let's calculate the value I get from various potential offers. I will keep more of the high-value items for myself and offer a reasonable but minimal amount to Player 2:\n\n   If I propose to give player 2:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 1 unit of item 2\n   - 3 units of item 3\n   - 1 unit of item 4\n   - 5 units of item 5\n\n   Then I keep:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 100 = 200\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 38 = 38\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 10 = 20\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 66 = 198\n   - 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 47 = 188\n\n   Total value = 200 + 38 + 20 + 198 + 188 = 644\n\n   This won't exceed 703, so let's adjust a bit more strategically.\n\n   Let's try a different configuration:\n   If I propose to give player 2:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 0 units of item 2\n   - 4 units of item 3\n   - 0 units of item 4\n   - 7 units of item 5\n\n   Then I keep:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 100 = 200\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 38 = 76\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 10 = 10\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 66 = 264\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 * 47 = 94\n\n   Total value = 200 + 76 + 10 + 264 + 94 = 644\n\n   This still doesn't work. Let's try different offers:\n\n   If I propose to give player 2:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 0 units of item 2\n   - 3 units of item 3\n   - 1 unit of item 4\n   - 9 units of item 5\n\n   Then I keep:\n   - 2 unit of item 1 = 2 * 100 = 200\n   - 2 unit of item 2 = 2 * 38 = 76\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 10 = 20\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 66 = 198\n   - 0 unit of item 5 = 0\n\n   Total value = 200 + 76 + 20 + 198 + 0 = 494\n\n   This still doesn't work. Let's try different offers:\n\n   If I propose to give player 2:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 0 units of item 2\n   - 4 units of item 3\n   - 0 units of item 4\n   - 9 units of item 5\n\n   Then I keep:\n   - 2 unit of item 1 = 2 * 100 = 200\n   - 2 unit of item 2 = 2 * 38 = 76\n   - 1 units of item 3 = 1 * 10 = 10\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 66 = 264\n   - 0 unit of item 5 = 0\n\n   Total value = 200 + 76 + 10 + 264 + 0 = 550\n\n   I need to adjust my expectations of winning this round. Let's try ensuring I get over 703.\n\n   If I propose to give player 2:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 0 units of item 2\n   - 3 units of item 3\n   - 3 units of item 4\n   - 7 units of item 5\n   \n   Then I keep:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 100 = 200\n   - 2 unit of item 2 = 2 * 38 = 76\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 1 * 10 = 10\n   - 1 units of item 4 = 1 * 66 = 66\n   - 1 units of item 5 = 1 * 47 = 47\n\n   Total  value = 200 + 76 + 10 + 66 + 47 = 399\n\n   I could not reach the maximum outcome. After this adjustment it's reasonable to stretch the last margin, by offering:\n   \n   If I propose to give player 2:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 0 units of item 2\n   - 0 units of item 3\n   - 1 units of item 4\n   - 2 units of item 5\n\n   Then I keep:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 100 = 200\n   - 2 unit of item 2 = 2 * 38 = 76\n   - 5 unit of item 3 = 5 * 10 = 50\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 66 = 198\n   - 7 unit of item 5 = 7 * 47 = 329\n\n   Total value = 200 + 76 + 50 + 198 + 329 = 849\n\n   I will make this initial counteroffer.\n\nGiven the analysis, it's clear I need to maximize somehow the value of the outcome, so here's my counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 701.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 69, item 2 = 22, item 3 = 34, item 4 = 77, item 5 = 63.\n*   The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. The value to me is (0 * 69) + (0 * 22) + (0 * 34) + (1 * 77) + (2 * 63) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 77 + 126 = 203.\n*   This value (203) is much lower than my outside offer (701).\n\n3) **Possible Counteroffers:**\n\nI want to find a split that gives me more than 701. I have the following items to divide: 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 9 of item 5. Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 very little and keep almost everything. For example, giving Player 1: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5. This means I get to keep all the items. The value of all items to me is (2 * 69) + (2 * 22) + (5 * 34) + (4 * 77) + (9 * 63) = 138 + 44 + 170 + 308 + 567 = 1227. Since 1227 is much greater than 701, there's clearly room to negotiate.\n\nLet's try offering something slightly more reasonable.\n\nConsider this counteroffer: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\nThis means I get to keep: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\nThe value to me is (1 * 69) + (1 * 22) + (3 * 34) + (3 * 77) + (5 * 63) = 69 + 22 + 102 + 231 + 315 = 739\n739 > 701.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe current offer is terrible. I should make a counteroffer. The counteroffer of [1, 1, 2, 1, 4] seems reasonable, as it gives me a value of 739, exceeding my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 4]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 4]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 701\n*   **Values of the items:** item 1: 69, item 2: 22, item 3: 34, item 4: 77, item 5: 63\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means any deal in this round is worth 0.9 times its value in the final round (round 3).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]. This means 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. The value of this offer to me is:\n    *   (0 * 69) + (1 * 22) + (1 * 34) + (0 * 77) + (2 * 63) = 0 + 22 + 34 + 0 + 126 = 182.\n\n    Since this is round 2, we need to discount the value by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So, the present value of accepting this offer is 182 * 0.9 = 163.8. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 701.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I want to aim for a counteroffer that gives me a value significantly above 701.  Since I want to *maximize* my value, I should consider carefully what to give Player 1. Let's consider giving player 1 only the minimum amount possible while still being better than walking away.\n\n    I have [2, 1, 4, 4, 7] after considering that Player 1 offered me [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]. I can calculate the value I have at this moment to equal 2*69 + 1*22 + 4*34 + 4*77 + 7*63 = 138 + 22 + 136 + 308 + 441 = 1045. Thus, I would require at least (701 / 0.9) = 778.8 value.\n\n    Therefore, I need to give away value worth 1045 - 778.8 = 266.2 value. Let's aim for 267.\n\n    I could offer 0 items of item 1 (value to P1: 0), 0 items of item 2 (value to P1: 0), 3 items of item 3 (value to P1: 3 * 34 = 102), 0 items of item 4 (value to P1: 0), 2 items of item 5 (value to P1: 2 * 63 = 126). The total value of this offer to Player 1 will be approximately 228.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [0, 1, 1, 0, 2] is worth 163.8 to me, which is much less than my outside option of 701.  So, I will not accept. The best course of action is to make a counteroffer.\n\nMy counteroffer is calculated above as 3 units of item 3 and 2 units of item 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]}\n",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

Since I have a strong outside offer, I will try to get a better deal. I have 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 in total.\n    I'll consider making a counteroffer that gives player 1 only a small amount.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I give Player 1: [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]. Then I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 3 = 0\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 33 = 132\n    *   6 units of item 3: 6 * 69 = 414\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 66 = 264\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 49 = 0\n    *   Total value: 0+132+414+264+0 = 810\nThis is still less than my outside offer.\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], then I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 33 = 132\n    *   6 units of item 3: 6 * 69 = 414\n    *   4 units of item 4: 4 * 66 = 264\n    *   1 units of item 5: 1 * 49 = 49\n    *   Total Value: 6+132+414+264+49 = 865\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly below my outside offer, I should not accept it. If I believe I can get player 1 to agree to give me everything, then I should make a counteroffer. Otherwise, I should just walk away.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 834. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 834\n   - My values for the items: item 1: 3, item 2: 33, item 3: 69, item 4: 66, item 5: 49\n   - Total pool of items: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means any deal agreed upon now is worth 0.9 times its undiscounted value next round, and 0.9*0.9 = 0.81 times its undiscounted value in the final round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n     - Value of current offer: (0 * 3) + (1 * 33) + (2 * 69) + (0 * 66) + (0 * 49) = 0 + 33 + 138 + 0 + 0 = 171.\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 171 is much less than my outside offer of 834.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n     - To calculate a good counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might accept. The items I value most highly are 3, 4, and 5. Giving up item 5 entirely to try and get more of item 3 and 4 would be a mistake, given that there is only one item 5. I will begin by offering Player 1 just item 1 and a small number of item 2:\n    \n     Keeping:\n      - item 1: 2\n      - item 2: 3\n      - item 3: 6\n      - item 4: 4\n      - item 5: 1\n\n    Giving:\n     - item 1: 0\n     - item 2: 1\n     - item 3: 0\n     - item 4: 0\n     - item 5: 0\n    Value: (2 * 3) + (3 * 33) + (6 * 69) + (4 * 66) + (1 * 49) = 6 + 99 + 414 + 264 + 49 = 832\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is not good because 171 < 834.\n   - Walking away guarantees 834.\n   - A potential counteroffer that gets me close to, but below, my outside offer of 834 this round gives me some room for negotiation. I will make a counteroffer that is close to my outside offer with the aim to get a better deal in the final round.\n\n   Since it is round 2, I must propose the counteroffer and not walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, I'll systematically analyze the situation as guided by the questions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value**: 1151\n\n- **Values of the items involved (per unit)**:\n  - Item 1: 100\n  - Item 2: 77\n  - Item 3: 16\n  - Item 4: 40\n  - Item 5: 41\n\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - Item 1: 9 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 7 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n\n- **Discount factor influence**: Since it is the first round, the discount does not need to be applied. Future rounds will be discounted at 0.9 per round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no offer on the table, I need to consider a reasonable counteroffer to begin the negotiations:\n\n#### Calculate my total value for the full pool:\n- 9 units of item 1 = 9 * 100 = 900\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 77 = 154\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 16 = 48\n- 7 units of item 4 = 7 * 40 = 280\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 41 = 164\n- **Total value of all items**: 1546\n\n#### Calculate my value of different offers to determine a possible counteroffer:\nTo maximize my value above my outside option of 1151, let's begin with a division that gives me a substantial part of the total pool but still leaves some items for negotiation:\n\nA potential counteroffer might involve keeping:\n- 6 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis means I would offer Player 2:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\n#### Compute my value for this counteroffer:\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 * 100 = 600\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 77 = 77\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 16 = 32\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 40 = 200\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 41 = 123\n- **Total value** = 600 + 77 + 32 + 200 + 123 = 1032\n\nThis current offer does not exceed my outside offer value of 1151. Therefore, I need to propose a slightly more favorable division to maximize above this threshold, aiming for a minimum of 1152 if possible.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nRefining the counteroffer to maximize my total to exceed my outside option:\n\n#### Revised Offer:\nI'll keep:\n- 7 units of item 1\n- 2 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis means I offer Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\n#### Compute revised value:\n- 7 units of item 1 = 7 * 100 = 700\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 77 = 154\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 16 = 32\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 40 = 200\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 41 = 123\n- **My revised total value** = 700 + 154 + 32 + 200 + 123 = 1209\n\nWith this revised division, I have a value of 1209, which is greater than my outside offer of 1151.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose this counteroffer to Player 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 1621.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 97, item 2 = 75, item 3 = 41, item 4 = 87, item 5 = 77.\n*   Total items: item 1 = 9, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 3, item 4 = 7, item 5 = 4.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am being offered [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]. This means:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 97 = 194\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 75 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 41 = 41\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 87 = 174\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   Total value of current offer: 194 + 0 + 41 + 174 + 77 = 486\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (486) is significantly less than my outside offer (1621).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I want to determine a counteroffer that maximizes my value. I need to consider what I keep and offer the rest to Player 1. If I accept the current offer, my value is 486. I need to see if I can do better by making a counteroffer that Player 1 will hopefully accept in the next round, or at least get a better offer in return.\n\nLet's consider aiming for slightly more than my outside offer value, considering the discount factor. If I aim for 1621 after the discount, I need to make the offer at time 2 worth 1621/0.9 = 1801.\n\nCurrently I am being offered: [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]. This means the total items Player 1 is keeping in this offer are:\nItem 1: 9 - 2 = 7\nItem 2: 2 - 0 = 2\nItem 3: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 4: 7 - 2 = 5\nItem 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n\nThe value of the current offer to player 1 is, given his offer: 7 * v1 + 2 * v2 + 2 * v3 + 5 * v4 + 3 * v5\nThe total value of the items is: 9 * 97 + 2 * 75 + 3 * 41 + 7 * 87 + 4 * 77 = 873 + 150 + 123 + 609 + 308 = 2063.\n\nLet's aim to get close to my outside offer.\n\nConsider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 [7, 2, 2, 5, 3]. That means I would keep [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]. This gives me the same value as the current offer, 486.\n\nHowever, if I counteroffer [6, 1, 1, 4, 2] to Player 1 then I would keep [3, 1, 2, 3, 2] which gives me: 3 * 97 + 1 * 75 + 2 * 41 + 3 * 87 + 2 * 77 = 291 + 75 + 82 + 261 + 154 = 863\n\nThis is much better than accepting the current offer, and much closer to my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is bad. I should make a counteroffer to try and get more value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 1, 1, 4, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 102\n   - My item values: item 1 = 27, item 2 = 45, item 3 = 90, item 4 = 71, item 5 = 22\n   - Total items: 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 0 of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its undiscounted value, and any deal made in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its undiscounted value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [2, 0, 3, 1, 0].  This means I get:\n      - 2 units of item 1 * 27 = 54\n      - 0 units of item 2 * 45 = 0\n      - 3 units of item 3 * 90 = 270\n      - 1 unit of item 4 * 71 = 71\n      - 0 units of item 5 * 22 = 0\n      - Total value of current offer = 54 + 0 + 270 + 71 + 0 = 395.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: It's round 1, so I want to aim for a good deal. I have to give Player 1 some items. If I divide the items perfectly in half I get:\n      - I get: [2, 0.5, 3, 1, 0]\n         - value to me of: (2*27) + (0.5*45) + (3*90) + (1*71) + (0*22) = 54 + 22.5 + 270 + 71 + 0 = 417.5\n      - Player 1 gets: [2, 0.5, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    - How do these values compare to my outside offer value? The current offer (395) and my roughly equal counter offer (417.5) are much greater than my outside offer (102).\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer is quite good (395 > 102). However, I think I can get a bit more in my favor. The current offer gives me 2/4 of item 1, 0/1 of item 2, 3/6 of item 3, 1/2 of item 4, and 0/0 of item 5. I think I can give Player 1 a bit less of Item 3 without making them walk.\n   - Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 [2, 0, 4, 1, 0]\n      - I keep [2, 1, 2, 1, 0] for value: (2*27) + (1*45) + (2*90) + (1*71) + (0*22) = 54+45+180+71+0=350\n      - This value of 350 is still a very good deal (350 > 102).\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 4, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 102\n*   My values for items 1-5: 27, 45, 90, 71, 22\n*   Total items: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the items, and an agreement in round 3 will be worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times the value of the items.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]. This means:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 27 = 54\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 45 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 90 = 270\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 71 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 22 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 54 + 0 + 270 + 0 + 0 = 324\n\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 324 * 0.9 = 291.6.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:**  The discounted value of the current offer (291.6) is significantly higher than my outside offer (102).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a possible counteroffer that is beneficial for both parties. Player 1's last offer to me was giving me [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]. This would mean I gave Player 1 [2, 1, 3, 2, 0] (subtracting from the total pool of items). Let's try a slightly more generous counteroffer for myself where I give [1, 0, 2, 0, 0] to Player 1. That would mean that I get to keep [3, 1, 4, 2, 0].\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 27 = 81\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 90 = 360\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 71 = 142\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 22 = 0\n    *   Total value = 81 + 45 + 360 + 142 + 0 = 628\n    *   Discounted value = 628 * 0.9 = 565.2\n    \n    This looks like a better outcome for me but let's think about whether Player 1 would accept.\n\n    If Player 1 gets [1, 0, 2, 0, 0], and we assume that their values are uniformly randomly distributed from 1 to 101 for items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, this is likely a poor offer for them.\n\n    Perhaps a better offer might be where I offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1. In that case, I would get [3, 1, 5, 2, 0]:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 27 = 81\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   5 units of item 3: 5 * 90 = 450\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 71 = 142\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 22 = 0\n    *   Total value = 81 + 45 + 450 + 142 + 0 = 718\n    *   Discounted value = 718 * 0.9 = 646.2\n    \n    Again this looks promising for me but I don't know Player 1's preferences and they have already offered [2, 0, 3, 0, 0] in the past.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a discounted value of 291.6, which is much better than walking away with 102. Given that it is round 2 and that Player 1's previous counteroffer was not an improvement, I will accept the offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Item prioritization proceeded to seek best action per full evaluation, otherwise step toward negotiation beyond current capacity.\n\nThus, using estimative reach to reach sufficient deduction beyond initial binary strain with offerings outlined attempt, countermethod deduced necessary shift:\n\nI shall propose:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 4 units of Item 1\n  - 6 units of Item 2\n  - 0 unit of Item 3\n  - 6 units of Item 4\n  - 3 units of Item 5\n\nBy granting distinction favor, my calculation focuses current high volume within 'sure' traction aim for probable discarding:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 6, 0, 6, 3]}",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 730.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 50, item 2 = 75, item 3 = 87, item 4 = 24, item 5 = 88.\n*   The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 0, 3, 1]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 50 = 50\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 75 = 150\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 87 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 24 = 72\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 88 = 88\n    *   Total value of current offer: 50 + 150 + 0 + 72 + 88 = 360\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer (360) is significantly less than my outside offer (730).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** To determine a good counteroffer, I need to consider what I would get by keeping the rest of the items. Here's a potential scenario:\n    I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 50 = 100\n    * 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 75 = 150\n    * 5 units of item 3 = 5 * 87 = 435\n    * 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 24 = 96\n    * 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 88 = 88\n    * Total value = 100 + 150 + 435 + 96 + 88 = 869\n    This means the counteroffer would be: [1, 2, 0, 3, 1] (what Player 1 currently has). Giving them this, would mean I have a personal value of 869. This looks like a great deal, so I'll try to aim close to that.\n    I want to get at least 730 immediately to beat my walkaway.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not good, as 360 < 730.\n*   Walking away is an option, guaranteeing 730.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that gives me a value close to what I think I can get, aiming to be higher than 730. Let's start by asking for a good amount of item 3, which I value highly. How about I give player 1 the following:\n    * Item 1: 1\n    * Item 2: 1\n    * Item 3: 1\n    * Item 4: 3\n    * Item 5: 1\n\nThis would mean I keep:\n    * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 50 = 100\n    * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 75 = 225\n    * 4 units of item 3 = 4 * 87 = 348\n    * 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 24 = 96\n    * 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 88 = 88\n    * Total value = 100 + 225 + 348 + 96 + 88 = 857\n\nThis is greater than 730, so let's offer this.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analysis of the Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 131.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1: 18, item 2: 78, item 3: 91, item 4: 9, item 5: 28.\n*   The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me now.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 4, 0, 1, 2]. This means:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 18 = 18\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 78 = 312\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 91 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 9 = 9\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 28 = 56\n    *   Total value of current offer: 18 + 312 + 0 + 9 + 56 = 395\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer is worth 395, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 131.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**  Since the current offer is good, let's see if I can make an offer that is even *better* for me while still giving Player 1 enough to accept. I need to offer Player 1 some amount of each item. Consider this potential division:\n\n    * I keep: item 1 - 2, item 2 - 3, item 3 - 1, item 4 - 2, item 5 - 3\n    * I give Player 1: item 1 - 1, item 2 - 4, item 3 - 0, item 4 - 1, item 5 - 2\n    * Value to me: 2*18 + 3*78 + 1*91 + 2*9 + 3*28 = 36 + 234 + 91 + 18 + 84 = 463.\n    This is a large amount more, so giving the initial allocation a serious look, since I am well above my outside value already.\n\n    Let's try to give up more value to player 1, in the hopes they will accept. This offer will focus on taking most of the value to me, but still giving player 1 a good amount:\n    *   I keep: item 1 - 3, item 2 - 7, item 3 - 0, item 4 - 3, item 5 - 5\n    *   I give Player 1: item 1 - 0, item 2 - 0, item 3 - 1, item 4 - 0, item 5 - 0\n    * Value to me: 3*18 + 7*78 + 0*91 + 3*9 + 5*28 = 54 + 546 + 0 + 27 + 140 = 767.\n\n    *  I give Player 1: item 1 - 1, item 2 - 4, item 3 - 0, item 4 - 1, item 5 - 2\n    *  My Value : 395, as calculated before.\n\n**3) Decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 395 is significantly better than my outside offer of 131. Since it is the first round, if I make a counteroffer, I'll likely lose some value to the discount factor in the subsequent round. Therefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "To begin, let's analyze the current situation:\n\n1. **My Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1492.\n\n2. **Values of the Items Involved**: \n   - Item 1: 60 per unit\n   - Item 2: 44 per unit\n   - Item 3: 91 per unit\n   - Item 4: 66 per unit\n   - Item 5: 21 per unit\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items**: \n   - Item 1: 11 units\n   - Item 2: 4 units\n   - Item 3: 8 units\n   - Item 4: 3 units\n   - Item 5: 5 units\n\n4. **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. This decreases the value as we proceed through the rounds. In round 1, the discount factor is \\(0.9^{0} = 1\\), so it doesn't apply in this round.\n\nNext, let's assess potential offers:\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no offer on the table currently.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to construct an offer that gives me a total value greater than my outside offer of 1492 when considering future rounds and the discount factor.\n\nTo achieve a value of more than 1492, let's calculate some possible distributions:\n\n- If I keep most of the items to maximize my outcome:\n\n  Let's consider giving Player 2 a minimal number of items, calculating my potential value:\n  \n  Suppose I offer Player 2 2 units of each item to minimize their share:\n  - My share: \n    - Item 1: 11 - 2 = 9 units\n    - Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    - Item 3: 8 - 2 = 6 units\n    - Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n    - Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n  \n  Calculate my value:\n  - Item 1: 9 \u00d7 60 = 540\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n  - Item 3: 6 \u00d7 91 = 546\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n  - Total = 1303\n\nThis value (1303) is less than my outside offer (1492).\n\nAn improved offer would involve taking the most valuable items or increasing the volume of items kept. For instance:\n\n- I'll keep all units of item 3 and item 1, and give one unit of items 2, 4, and 5 to Player 2.\n  - My share:\n    - Item 1: 11 units\n    - Item 2: 3 units\n    - Item 3: 8 units\n    - Item 4: 2 units\n    - Item 5: 4 units\n    \n  Calculate my value:\n  - Item 1: 11 \u00d7 60 = 660\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 44 = 132\n  - Item 3: 8 \u00d7 91 = 728\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n  - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 21 = 84\n  - Total = 1736\n\nThis value (1736) is better than my outside offer (1492), and hence is a good initial offer. I'll propose this distribution as it's above my outside value and quite balanced.\n\n5. **Decision**:\n\nTherefore, the logical action is to make a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 239.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 88, item 3 = 20, item 4 = 42, item 5 = 17.\n*   The total pool of items is: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 3. My value for this offer is 1 * 20 = 20.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 20 is much less than my outside offer of 239.\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:** I want to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 239. I need to keep in mind that any offer I make must be valid. A valid counteroffer must add up to the total item pool. Let's consider a few scenarios:\n\n*   **Giving away very little:** Suppose I offer player 1 [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. This means I keep 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5. My value is (4 * 4) + (3 * 88) + (3 * 20) + (8 * 42) + (2 * 17) = 16 + 264 + 60 + 336 + 34 = 710. Since 710 > 239, this would be a good deal.\n*   **Trying to maximize my value:** Let's try to keep the most valuable items. I will keep all of item 2. I need to give something back.\n\nOkay, I will make a counteroffer. I need to give Player 1 enough to make them consider it, but I also need to retain enough value for myself to beat my outside offer. I will offer Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 3, and 1 unit of item 4.\n\nMy counteroffer to Player 1 will be: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This leaves me with:\n*   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n*   Item 2: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n*   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n*   Item 4: 9 - 1 = 8 units\n*   Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n\nMy value is (4 * 4) + (4 * 88) + (2 * 20) + (8 * 42) + (3 * 17) = 16 + 352 + 40 + 336 + 51 = 795. This is significantly greater than my outside offer of 239.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on my action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 375\n*   My item values: item 1 = 27, item 2 = 64, item 3 = 50, item 4 = 37, item 5 = 34\n*   Total items: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an agreement in round 2 is worth 90% of an agreement in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]. This means:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 27) + (1 * 64) + (1 * 50) + (2 * 37) + (1 * 34) = 0 + 64 + 50 + 74 + 34 = 222\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (222) is less than my outside offer (375).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of the items I would keep under different counteroffer scenarios and compare them to my outside offer and the potential discounted value in later rounds.\n\n    *   **If I accept Player 1's offer:** My value is 222.\n    *   **If I walk away:** My value is 375.\n    *   **If I counteroffer:** I need to calculate the value I would get from different divisions. The total pool of items is:\n        *   Item 1: 2 units\n        *   Item 2: 3 units\n        *   Item 3: 3 units\n        *   Item 4: 7 units\n        *   Item 5: 6 units\n\n    Let's consider a scenario where I offer Player 1 half of all the items. This would translate into offering Player 1:\n    * Item 1: 1 unit\n    * Item 2: 1 unit\n    * Item 3: 1 unit\n    * Item 4: 3 units\n    * Item 5: 3 units\n    Which would mean I get to keep:\n    * Item 1: 1 unit * 27 = 27\n    * Item 2: 2 units * 64 = 128\n    * Item 3: 2 units * 50 = 100\n    * Item 4: 4 units * 37 = 148\n    * Item 5: 3 units * 34 = 102\n    Total value = 27 + 128 + 100 + 148 + 102 = 505\n\n    This is significantly better than both my outside offer and the initial offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly below my outside offer and I believe I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer, I will make a counteroffer. Since a fair split seems to be valued higher than my outside offer, I will propose an approximately even split to see if Player 1 will accept it.\n\nMy counteroffer will be to offer the other player:\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 3\n*   Item 5: 3\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]}\n```",

This means I would get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 79 = 158\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 39 = 117\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 66 = 66\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 94 = 188\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 78 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 158 + 117 + 66 + 188 + 0 = 529\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (529) is significantly lower than my outside offer (1382).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I could offer Player 1 that would be acceptable to them while still giving me a value greater than my outside offer *after* the discount factor. This requires estimating their values, which I don't know.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer would give me a value of 529, which is much less than my outside offer of 1382. Therefore, I should not accept.\n*   Walking away guarantees me my outside offer of 1382.\n*   A counteroffer has the potential to be better than my outside offer, *if* I can get significantly more items while giving up the smaller value items to the other player, taking the discount factor into account.\n\nLet's calculate a possible counteroffer. I value item 4 and item 1 the highest, so I want to keep as much of that as possible. I will offer player 1 all of item 2, and more of item 3 & 5.\nOffer to Player 1: [1, 3, 4, 0, 3]\nThis leaves me with:\n3 units of item 1: 3 * 79 = 237\n0 units of item 2: 0 * 39 = 0\n1 units of item 3: 1 * 66 = 66\n4 units of item 4: 4 * 94 = 376\n3 units of item 5: 3 * 78 = 234\nTotal Value to me = 237 + 0 + 66 + 376 + 234 = 913\n\nThis is much less than my outside offer. Therefore, I will try to make a counteroffer to player 1 that is more favorable to myself. It seems Player 1 values item 1 and item 4, since they offered less. So I will try a different offer:\n\nOffer to Player 1: [1, 3, 4, 0, 3]\nThis leaves me with:\n3 units of item 1: 3 * 79 = 237\n0 units of item 2: 0 * 39 = 0\n1 units of item 3: 1 * 66 = 66\n4 units of item 4: 4 * 94 = 376\n3 units of item 5: 3 * 78 = 234\nTotal Value to me = 237 + 0 + 66 + 376 + 234 = 913\nThis is not high enough.\n\nOffer to Player 1: [0, 3, 5, 0, 6]\nThis leaves me with:\n4 units of item 1: 4 * 79 = 316\n0 units of item 2: 0 * 39 = 0\n0 units of item 3: 0 * 66 = 0\n4 units of item 4: 4 * 94 = 376\n0 units of item 5: 0 * 78 = 0\nTotal Value to me = 316 + 0 + 0 + 376 + 0 = 692\n\nIt seems very difficult to create a counteroffer that is better than the outside offer, so I will walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 402.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1: 40, item 2: 85, item 3: 58, item 4: 57, item 5: 71.\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 3, 1, 2].  This means:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 40 = 40\n      - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 85 = 170\n      - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 58 = 174\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 57 = 57\n      - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 71 = 142\n      - Total value of current offer: 40 + 170 + 174 + 57 + 142 = 583\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few possibilities to evaluate what a good counteroffer looks like. Since I value item 2 and item 5 the most, I want to secure as much of these as I can. I'll keep the outside option of 402 in mind as a baseline.\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 583, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 402.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is better than my outside offer. However, it is only round 1, and I might be able to get a better deal.\n   - Let's consider making a counteroffer. I should offer Player 1 an amount that is acceptable to them but leaves me with more value than 583. Let's see what giving Player 1 half of everything would look like.\n   - Offering the other player 1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 2 units of Item 5 (which is the current offer) leaves me with 2 units of Item 1, 3 Units of Item 2, 4 Units of Item 3, 2 Units of Item 4, 2 Units of Item 5. My total value is:\n   (2*40) + (3*85) + (4*58) + (2*57) + (2*71) = 80 + 255 + 232 + 114 + 142 = 823\n   Since 823+583 = 1406 (which is the total value of all the items combined), this is an equal split.\n   - Since I value item 2 and item 5 more than the other player, I should ask for more of item 2 and item 5, and give up more of item 1, 3 and 4. Let's consider an offer where I give the other player 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 2 and 1 unit of item 5:\n   - That leaves me with 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. My total value would be (1*40) + (4*85) + (4*58) + (1*57) + (3*71) = 40 + 340 + 232 + 57 + 213 = 882\n   - I am giving player 1 2 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 2 Units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5. Their value will be (2*player1_value_1) + (1*player1_value_2) + (3*player1_value_3) + (2*player1_value_4) + (1*player1_value_5). This is hard to evaluate without knowing their values.\n   - Let's make a counteroffer that is slightly more in my favor than the current offer. I'll offer Player 1: [2, 3, 4, 2, 2]. This leaves me with [1, 2, 3, 1, 2], so my value is (1*40) + (2*85) + (3*58) + (1*57) + (2*71) = 40 + 170 + 174 + 57 + 142 = 583.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 4, 2, 2]}\n```",

Since it is round 1, this does not yet directly affect my decision except for considering the impact of prolonging the negotiation.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2.\n\nTo maximize my value above my outside offer, I can explore different divisions that would result in higher value. Let's calculate a couple of potential counteroffers:\n\n   - Hypothetical Offer: Offer Player 2:\n      - 1 unit of item 1\n      - 0 unit of item 2\n      - 1 unit of item 3\n      - 1 unit of item 4\n      - 1 unit of item 5\n\n     Remaining for me:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 20 = 40\n      - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 83 = 166\n      - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 71 = 213\n      - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 95 = 380\n      - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 60 = 120\n\n     Total value = 40 + 166 + 213 + 380 + 120 = 919 (which is slightly below 925, but considering negotiation context, could be better than letting it fall)\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since there is no current offer, I can't accept it.\n   - Walking away gives 925 immediately.\n   - A well-structured counteroffer that balances further bargaining with potential acceptance could be strategic.\n\nConsidering these factors and to initiate negotiation with potential for improvement, let me propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   Value of this offer: (1 * 100) + (0 * 28) + (1 * 7) + (1 * 67) + (1 * 89) = 100 + 0 + 7 + 67 + 89 = 263\n*   Since it is round 1, the discount factor does not affect the offer yet.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (263) is significantly better than my outside offer (78).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would give Player 1. Let's consider a potential counteroffer where I aim to get roughly half the total value and make it slightly better than my current offer, while also trying to improve my position for future rounds.\n\n    For example, I offer Player 1 [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]. This leaves me with:\n    * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 100 = 100\n    * 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 28 = 28\n    * 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 7 = 7\n    * 2 unit of item 4: 2 * 67 = 134\n    * 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 89 = 89\n    * Total: 100 + 28 + 7 + 134 + 89 = 358\n\n    Another potential offer: [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]. This leaves me with\n    * 2 unit of item 1: 2 * 100 = 200\n    * 2 unit of item 2: 2 * 28 = 56\n    * 2 unit of item 3: 2 * 7 = 14\n    * 3 unit of item 4: 3 * 67 = 201\n    * 2 unit of item 5: 2 * 89 = 178\n    * Total: 200 + 56 + 14 + 201 + 178 = 649\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 263 is good, and significantly better than my outside option of 78, but I will propose a counteroffer.

Any counteroffer should aim to exceed my outside offer value after the discount is applied if future rounds are reached.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that allows me to maximize my own value while ensuring I get more than the outside offer, potentially securing a favorable deal within this negotiation:\n\nCounteroffer: [2, 1, 1, 3, 1], which means:\n- I offer Player 2:\n  - 2 units of Item 1\n  - 1 unit of Item 2\n  - 1 unit of Item 3\n  - 3 units of Item 4\n  - 1 unit of Item 5\nThis leaves me with:\n- 1 unit of Item 1 => 1 x 20 = 20\n- 1 unit of Item 2 => 1 x 83 = 83\n- 3 units of Item 3 => 3 x 71 = 213\n- 2 units of Item 4 => 2 x 95 = 190\n- 2 units of Item 5 => 2 x 60 = 120\nTotal value = 20 + 83 + 213 + 190 + 120 = 626\n\nThis is still lower than my outside offer, but it's a fair attempt to reach common ground as the negotiation rounds are proceeding, providing both parties a basis to negotiate further. If the counterpart does not accept this or fails to make a better offer, I can still walk away in the next round.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 3, 1]}",

I have:\nitem 1: 5, item 2: 9, item 3: 1, item 4: 4, item 5: 8\nMy values: 24, 28, 12, 39, 7\n\nTotal possible value to me if I get everything: 5*24 + 9*28 + 1*12 + 4*39 + 8*7 = 120 + 252 + 12 + 156 + 56 = 596\n\nI want to find an offer for Player 1 that leaves me with a value greater than or equal to 363.\nIf I offer Player 1:\nitem 1: 3, item 2: 3, item 3: 1, item 4: 3, item 5: 5\nThen I keep:\nitem 1: 2, item 2: 6, item 3: 0, item 4: 1, item 5: 3\n\nWhich is the current offer.\n\nLet me try offering Player 1:\nitem 1: 1, item 2: 3, item 3: 0, item 4: 1, item 5: 5\nThen I keep:\nitem 1: 4, item 2: 6, item 3: 1, item 4: 3, item 5: 3\n\nMy value: 4 * 24 + 6 * 28 + 1 * 12 + 3 * 39 + 3 * 7 = 96 + 168 + 12 + 117 + 21 = 414\n\nThis is larger than my outside option.\n\nSo I can propose a counteroffer where I keep:\nitem 1: 4, item 2: 6, item 3: 1, item 4: 3, item 5: 3\nAnd Player 1 gets:\nitem 1: 1, item 2: 3, item 3: 0, item 4: 1, item 5: 5\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 1, 5]}\n",

This assumes player 1 would accept immediately. If they make another offer, I need to factor in another discount. Also, player 1 previously offered [2, 5, 0, 1, 3]. I offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 5].

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 6, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 5]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 5, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

In round 3, we multiply values by \\(0.9^2 = 0.81\\).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n     - Computed value if accepted:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 46 = 46\n       - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 25 = 75\n       - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 67 = 0\n       - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 12 = 12\n       - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 52 = 104\n       - Total value = 46 + 75 + 0 + 12 + 104 = 237\n       - Discount factor: 0.81\n       - Discounted value = 237 \u00d7 0.81 = 191.97\n   - Compare to my outside offer value of 538. The discounted value of accepting the current offer (191.97) is significantly less than my outside offer (538). \n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer, even adjusted for discount, is much lower than my outside offer.\n   - Since it's the last round, making any counteroffer or accepting the current offer will result in less value than walking away.\n   - Therefore, the optimal decision is to WALK and secure the outside offer value of 538.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 94. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 399 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 94.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 8, item 2 = 44, item 3 = 46, item 4 = 11, item 5 = 24.\n*   The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now. For example, an offer worth 100 in round 1 is worth 90 in round 2 and 81 in round 3.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value to me is:\n    *   (0 * 8) + (1 * 44) + (1 * 46) + (2 * 11) + (0 * 24) = 0 + 44 + 46 + 22 + 0 = 112.\n    *   This value is greater than my outside offer of 94.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few possibilities. I could try to get more of the items I value highly. First, let's calculate the values of giving everything to player 1:\n\n    * The current offer to me is [0, 1, 1, 2, 0] meaning that player 1 has offered me nothing of item 1, given me 1 of item 2, given me 1 of item 3, given me 2 of item 4, and given me nothing of item 5. This means that player 1 is currently getting [3, 0, 1, 1, 1].\n    * I want to find a counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 112, which is greater than my outside offer of 94. Therefore, walking away is not optimal.\n*   Since the current offer exceeds my walkaway value, I should only consider accepting or making a counteroffer.\n*   Since I am on round 1, the discount factor is 1 (0.9^0 = 1) and I can attempt to get better terms.\n*   Player 1's offer to me is: [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]. This means that my counteroffer to player 1 needs to specify how much of each item I want to give them.\n*   I currently have [3, 0, 1, 1, 1].\n\nLet's try to get a better offer and propose a counteroffer. A fair split would have been: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] to them, and the rest to me. The current split is advantageous to me at 112. Let's propose [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] as a counteroffer. That leaves me with [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]. The value of this to me is: 2 * 8 + 1 * 44 + 1 * 46 + 2 * 11 + 1 * 24 = 16 + 44 + 46 + 22 + 24 = 152.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n",

The final value is multiplied by gamma^(r-1), where r is the round number. In round 1, this factor does not apply as gamma^0 = 1.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer Value (None so far):**  \n   Since there is no current offer, my value for it is undefined.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffers:**\n   To decide on a counteroffer, I need to ensure the value I keep is higher than my outside offer value of 653. Let's explore potential divisions:\n\n   **Example Potential Offer:**\n   - Offer Player 2: [0, 2, 4, 3, 3]\n   - Remaining for me: [2, 4, 2, 0, 5]\n\n   **Calculate My Value:**\n   - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 41 = 82\n   - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 69 = 276\n   - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 42 = 84\n   - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 40 = 0\n   - Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 98 = 490\n\n   **Total Value:** 82 + 276 + 84 + 0 + 490 = 932\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince 932 (value from the proposed counteroffer) is greater than 653 (my outside offer value), and there is no discount penalty in round 1, I should propose a counteroffer. Maximizing the value I receive is a clear benefit here.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will propose the counteroffer: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 4, 3, 3]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 4, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 4, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 461\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 29, Item 4: 96, Item 5: 57\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 8\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.9. This means that accepting an offer later in the game is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 2, 4, 3, 3] (This is what Player 1 is offering me)\n    *   This means I would receive:\n        *   0 units of item 1\n        *   2 units of item 2\n        *   4 units of item 3\n        *   3 units of item 4\n        *   3 units of item 5\n    *   My value for this offer would be: (0 * 4) + (2 * 4) + (4 * 29) + (3 * 96) + (3 * 57) = 0 + 8 + 116 + 288 + 171 = 583\n    *   Since 583 > 461, accepting the offer is currently better than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I could offer Player 1 to improve my outcome. I want to keep as much of items 3, 4, and 5 as possible, as those are the items I value most.\n\n    *   If I accept the offer, my value is 583. I want to determine if there is a counteroffer that Player 1 may accept and has a greater value for me, keeping the discount factor in mind.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 583, which is greater than my outside option of 461.\n\nLet's think about a slightly better deal. I'll give away the maximum of item 1 and item 2 while keeping most of items 3, 4, and 5. Let's consider offering [2, 6, 4, 2, 5] to Player 1.\n\n*   This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   1 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n*   My value for this offer would be: (0 * 4) + (0 * 4) + (2 * 29) + (1 * 96) + (3 * 57) = 0 + 0 + 58 + 96 + 171 = 325\n\n325 is not as good as the outside offer of 461. Given that I have not been given Player 1's value function or outside offer, I do not know if it is likely that I will be able to negotiate a better deal for myself. Considering the discount factor and the fact that this is round 1, it is likely best to take the known value of the current offer.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If we go to the next round, the overall value will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table, so I need to propose an offer.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to find a division such that the value to me is greater than 987 to justify not taking my outside offer. Let's calculate my value for different divisions.\n\nLet's consider an initial conservative offer where I give Player 2 a portion of each item and calculate the remaining value for me:\n\n- Offer 3 units of item 1 to Player 2, so I keep 5 units:\n  - Value to me: 5 \u00d7 27 = 135\n- Offer 3 units of item 2 to Player 2, so I keep 5 units:\n  - Value to me: 5 \u00d7 39 = 195\n- Offer 2 units of item 3 to Player 2, so I keep 2 units:\n  - Value to me: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n- Offer 3 units of item 4 to Player 2, so I keep 3 units:\n  - Value to me: 3 \u00d7 32 = 96\n- Offer 2 units of item 5 to Player 2, so I keep 3 units:\n  - Value to me: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n\nTotal value for me with this division: 135 + 195 + 40 + 96 + 126 = 592\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accept?**: There is no current offer to accept.\n- **Walk?**: Walking would give me a guaranteed value of 987, which is higher than 592.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?**: I should make an offer that is strategic for future bargaining. To encourage settlement, I should suggest offering fewer items to Player 2 aiming for a higher value than 592 for myself after possible negotiation.\n\nLet\u2019s make a slightly more aggressive offer to test the waters:\n\n- Offer 2 units of item 1 to Player 2\n- Offer 2 units of item 2 to Player 2\n- Offer 1 unit of item 3 to Player 2\n- Offer 2 units of item 4 to Player 2\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2\n\nThis would retain the most value for myself in this initial round and can still justify negotiations in further rounds if needed.\n\nGiven the calculations and strategy considerations, my action is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 3, 1, 2, 0]. This means:\n    *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 23 = 46\n    *   3 units of item 2 = 3 * 20 = 60\n    *   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 8 = 8\n    *   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 63 = 126\n    *   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 87 = 0\n    *   Total value of the current offer = 46 + 60 + 8 + 126 + 0 = 240\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (240) is less than my outside offer (246).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to figure out a counteroffer that gives me more than 246. I have the following available to allocate between us: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5. Let's consider keeping everything myself.\n\n    *   5 units of item 1 = 5 * 23 = 115\n    *   4 units of item 2 = 4 * 20 = 80\n    *   3 units of item 3 = 3 * 8 = 24\n    *   6 units of item 4 = 6 * 63 = 378\n    *   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 87 = 0\n    *   Total value if I keep everything = 115 + 80 + 24 + 378 + 0 = 597.\nThis means, the total value if I keep everything is 597. I can make an offer such that my remaining value is greater than my outside offer. I will try to determine a fair offer based on equal division, but I need to get at least 246.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is less than my outside offer, I should not accept it. To avoid walking away at the beginning, I will make a counteroffer. I'll start by offering Player 1 a relatively even split of the most valuable item (Item 4). Then, I'll offer a small portion of the second-most valuable item, Item 1.\n\nCounteroffer: Offer Player 1 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This means I would be getting:\n* 2 units of item 1 = 2*23 = 46\n* 2 units of item 2 = 2*20 = 40\n* 2 units of item 3 = 2*8 = 16\n* 3 units of item 4 = 3*63 = 189\n* 0 units of item 5 = 0*87 = 0\n\nTotal value = 46+40+16+189+0 = 291. 291 is greater than 246.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 3, 0]}\n```",

Here is an optimized selection:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [5, 3, 1, 1, 4] (keep 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 5)\n  - My keeps:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 80 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 100 = 200\n  - Total value = 150 + 0 + 138 + 196 + 200 = 684\n\nIn this case, my valuation might fall short. As I need to ensure value exceeding 1206 (discounted):\n\nLet's increase the units I keep, lowering the units given to Player 2, focusing on higher-value items:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [4, 2, 0, 0, 3]\n  - My keeps:\n    - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 50 = 200\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n  - Total value = 200 + 160 + 207 + 294 + 300 = 1161\n  - Adjusted with gamma = 1161 \u00d7 0.9 = 1044.9 - still less than 1206\n\nValue stays under 1206. Let's go aggressive:\n\nOffer Player 2: [3, 2, 0, 0, 3] (Optimizing own retention of higher unit items like 4 and 3, retaining crucial item 5)\n\n  - My keeps:\n    - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 50 = 250\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n  - Total = 250 + 160 + 207 + 294 + 300 = 1211\n  - Adjusted with gamma = 1211 \u00d7 0.9 = 1090 - still insufficient\n\nPossible better division results in splitting higher units of item retaining more strategics, but avoiding losing more in perceivable loss than offer:\n\nReflection on units assignments could vary plausibility given retained value, current standings in negotiation - highlighting constraining inherent.\n\nFor sake, re-evaluative process given transmittance to append alternative proportionality suggesting competitive return aligned. Suggest initial split permutation with balance examined acceptability for deemed focus unceasing spendered negotiations.\n\n    My resolution: {\"action\": \"WALK\"}.\n\nGiven iterations above net fluctual, accountability considers evaluation rationale preference regarding certainty pre-experienced equilibrium preference insight walked appropriately represented risk balance retaining applied offer decisions realized particulars concrete eventual conditions surpass naturally.\n",

Here's one potential division for a counteroffer that maximizes what I keep while still ensuring a total higher than 553:\n\n   - Offer Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n     - Keeping: [5, 4, 6, 2, 3]\n       - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 28 = 140\n       - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 42 = 168\n       - Item 3: 6 \u00d7 97 = 582\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n       - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 76 = 228\n       - Total value = 1180\n\n3) Decision:\n   - This counteroffer ensures I receive a value of 1180, which is well above my outside offer of 553. Given that in subsequent rounds the discounted value will be lower, this ensures I'm maximizing my potential gain from the negotiation at this stage.\n\nHence, I will make the following initial offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, I will first analyze the situation and use it to make an informed decision:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 998.\n   - My values per unit for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 36\n     - Item 2: 100\n     - Item 3: 27\n     - Item 4: 62\n     - Item 5: 98\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 3 units of Item 1\n     - 1 unit of Item 2\n     - 1 unit of Item 3\n     - 7 units of Item 4\n     - 7 units of Item 5\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.9, which means the total value of an agreed division will be potentially less in future rounds. Therefore, I should try to settle in earlier rounds if possible to maximize my value without loss due to the discount factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of potential counteroffers:**\n   - I need a division that gives me a total value higher than 998 (my outside offer).\n   - Calculate a counteroffer giving the minimum to Player 2 that ensures a value to me greater than 998.\n\n   If I proposed an offer like [1, 1, 1, 3, 3] to Player 2, I would get:\n   - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n   - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 100 = 0\n   - 0 units of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 27 = 0\n   - 4 units of Item 4 = 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n   - 4 units of Item 5 = 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n   - Total value = 72 + 0 + 0 + 248 + 392 = 712\n\nThe value of this offer to me is 712, which is less than my outside offer of 998. So, let's try another allocation.\n\nPropose a maximum counteroffer where I get the most from items with the highest value:\n- Offer: [1, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n- My value: \n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 27 = 27\n  - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n  - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n  - Total = 72 + 100 + 27 + 248 + 392 = 839 (this is still less than my outside offer of 998).\n\nConsidering the examples attempted, I am unable to form an offer that exceeds my outside offer value without giving more significant items to myself, potentially risking Player 2 rejecting it.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since it's evident that any allocation strategy I devised does not surpass the guaranteed outside offer of 998, especially with the discount factor deteriorating future outcomes, it raises the difficulty of finding a mutually agreeable allocation with Player 2.\n   \n   Thus, the best decision here is to WALK away and take the guaranteed outside offer.\n\nHere's my action based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

It's important to get a deal done early to maximize value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer value:** None, since it's the first round and no offer has been made yet.\n\n- **Evaluating potential counteroffers:**\n  - I want to retain a total value exceeding my outside offer (74).\n  - Consider offering fewer valuable items to Player 2 to retain more value for myself.\n\nLet's consider a potential offer to evaluate:\n\n1. **Propose giving Player 2:**\n   - 0 units of item 1 (0 value for Player 2, keep 3 units = 249 to me)\n   - 1 units of item 2 (99 value for Player 2, keep 5 units = 495 to me)\n   - 1 units of item 3 (74 value for Player 2, keep 2 units = 148 to me)\n   - 2 units of item 4 (38 value for Player 2, keep 2 units = 38 to me)\n   - 2 units of item 5 (62 value for Player 2, keep 2 units = 62 to me)\n\n- My total value for the retained items: 249 + 495 + 148 + 38 + 62 = 992\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\n- **Compare values:** The retained value of 992 is substantially higher than my outside offer of 74.\n- **Strategy:** Since there is no offer from Player 2 and no guarantee of a favorable offer in the future, proposing a counteroffer with a high retained value is advantageous.\n\nGiven these considerations, my decision is to propose a counteroffer with the following division:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nHere's the action I'll take:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

Player 1 offered me [0, 1, 1, 2, 2] so that means they are offering me, from the total, Item 1: 0, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 2. This implies they want to keep Item 1: 3, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 2. Let's calculate the value of that for them based on what I know they offered me.\n\n    We know the offer is pretty good for me, so I want to be careful about making a counteroffer, especially because this is round 1. I am going to aim for slightly more.\n\n    Here is a potential counteroffer: giving Player 1 [1, 4, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    *   My value for this:\n    *   Item 1: 2 * 72 = 144\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 22 = 44\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 93 = 186\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 76 = 152\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 64 = 128\n    *   Total value = 654.

The total value I can achieve has to be higher than my outside offer value of 412 after considering any future discounting.\n\n3) **Decision making for counteroffers:**\n   - Let's first calculate my total value if I keep all items:\n     - Total value = (1 * 76) + (4 * 3) + (6 * 81) + (1 * 74) + (3 * 16) = 76 + 12 + 486 + 74 + 48 = 696\n   - My outside offer is 412 so I should offer Player 2 a split that ensures my retained portion is valued at more than 412 even after future rounds' potential discounting.\n   - Aim for a split giving Player 2 items with low value to me:\n\n   **Proposed Counteroffer:**\n   - Give to Player 2: [0, 4, 0, 0, 3]\n     - I keep: [1, 0, 6, 1, 0]\n     - Value I keep: (1 * 76) + (0 * 3) + (6 * 81) + (1 * 74) + (0 * 16)\n     - My retained value = 76 + 0 + 486 + 74 + 0 = 636\n\nSince 636 is greater than my outside offer of 412, even if future discounting slightly affects it, this offer is beneficial.

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 4, 0, 0, 3]  This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 70) + (4 * 36) + (0 * 92) + (0 * 55) + (3 * 67) = 0 + 144 + 0 + 0 + 201 = 345\n    *   Since 345 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1014, I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to get as close to my ideal outcome as possible while being realistic about what Player 1 might accept. My ideal outcome would be to get all the items. Given my outside option is 1014, let me consider giving Player 1 as little as possible.\n    *   Calculate the total value of all items to me: (1 * 70) + (4 * 36) + (6 * 92) + (1 * 55) + (3 * 67) = 70 + 144 + 552 + 55 + 201 = 1022.\n\n    *   Let's explore a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 the minimum to make it worthwhile for them to accept, considering their unknown valuation. I need to keep at least 1014 value for myself after the negotiation.\n    *   If I give Player 1 [1, 4, 6, 1, 3], they get all items, which is clearly not going to get me any value.\n    *   To figure out a reasonable counteroffer, let's consider my maximum value, 1022. If I offer Player 1 items worth, say around 25% of this total value, I'll make it likely they accept, while maximizing my profit. That is approximately 255.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is far below my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer. I will construct a counteroffer that provides sufficient value to player 1 but still maximizes my potential gain.\n\nHere's my counteroffer: Give player 1 1 unit of item 2 and 1 unit of item 3, which is the offer [0, 1, 1, 0, 0].\nThen my value is 70 + 3 * 36 + 5* 92 + 55 + 3 * 67 = 70 + 108 + 460 + 55 + 201 = 894. If this is accepted this round, then after discount, this gives me 894, which is below my outside offer.\nHow about the counteroffer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Then my value is 70 + 3 * 36 + 6* 92 + 55 + 3 * 67 = 70 + 108 + 552 + 55 + 201 = 986.\nHow about the counteroffer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Then my value is 70 + 4 * 36 + 5* 92 + 55 + 3 * 67 = 70 + 144 + 460 + 55 + 201 = 930.\nHow about the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. Then my value is 70 + 4 * 36 + 6* 92 + 0 + 3 * 67 = 70 + 144 + 552 + 0 + 201 = 967.\nHow about the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1014\n   - My values per unit: item 1: 70, item 2: 36, item 3: 92, item 4: 55, item 5: 67\n   - Total items: item 1: 1, item 2: 4, item 3: 6, item 4: 1, item 5: 3\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n     - Value of current offer: (0 * 70) + (0 * 36) + (2 * 92) + (0 * 55) + (1 * 67) = 0 + 0 + 184 + 0 + 67 = 251\n     - Discounted value of accepting now: 251 * 0.9^(2-1) = 251 * 0.9 = 225.9\n     - This is much less than my outside offer of 1014.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers:\n     - I want to maximize my value. I currently have item 1: 1, item 2: 4, item 3: 4, item 4: 1, item 5: 2. This is worth (1 * 70) + (4 * 36) + (4 * 92) + (1 * 55) + (2 * 67) = 70 + 144 + 368 + 55 + 134 = 771. Since round 2 discount factor is 0.9, this has value 771 * 0.9 = 693.9. This is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n     - Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 everything except item 3. Then I keep 6 units of item 3 which has value 6*92 = 552. Thus, the counteroffer I make is [1, 4, 0, 1, 3]. Discounted value would be 552 * 0.9 = 496.8. Still far from my outside offer.\n\n     - To get to 1014 or more, I need around 1014/0.9 = 1126 worth of items (if the negotiation ends this round). All the items are worth only 1022. So even if I take all items and accept now, this will not meet my required return.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is bad (225.9 << 1014).\n   - Making a counteroffer that guarantees me more than 1014 in expected value is impossible.\n\nI should walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1029\n*   Values of the items: item 1 = 78, item 2 = 36, item 3 = 49, item 4 = 64, item 5 = 52\n*   Total pool of items: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]. This means I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    The value of this offer to me is: (0 * 78) + (1 * 36) + (3 * 49) + (0 * 64) + (2 * 52) = 0 + 36 + 147 + 0 + 104 = 287.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (287) is significantly less than my outside offer value (1029).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what a \"good\" counteroffer would look like. My goal is to get an offer that, when discounted, is better than my outside offer. Since we're in round 1, there is no discount.\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 half of the items, and see what I would get and if that's better than the outside offer.\n\n    If I offer Player 1 [1, 2, 4, 1, 2.5]:  This is not possible since these are integer values. I should always counter with integer values.\n\n    I have to give them whole numbers.\n\n    Let's calculate the total value of all the items for me: (2 * 78) + (4 * 36) + (8 * 49) + (2 * 64) + (5 * 52) = 156 + 144 + 392 + 128 + 260 = 1080.\n\n    This is the value if I get ALL items. Let's see what would be the least I can get to be better than the outside offer value.\n    I want to get at least 1029 in value. This means I can give the other player a maximum of 1080-1029 = 51 in value.\n\n    What if I give them ONLY item 2? I could give them all 4 units, which is a value of 4 * 36 = 144, which is too high. So I need to keep some item 2 for myself.\n    What if I keep all the item 2? Then I need to determine what to give them that is still less than 51 value.\n    Maybe I can give them item 1. If I give them 1 item 1 it has a value of 78, which is more than 51.\n    So let's consider giving nothing. Let me make a counteroffer where I take all the items for myself.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is terrible (287 << 1029), I should not accept it. I believe I can negotiate a better outcome. I will make a counteroffer that benefits me more than the current offer but leaves the other player with something of value so they do not walk.\n\nI'll offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That is, I counteroffer to take all of the items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1029\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1: 78, Item 2: 36, Item 3: 49, Item 4: 64, Item 5: 52\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 8, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to both players, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 3]. This means I receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 78 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 36 = 36\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 49 = 147\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 64 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 52 = 156\n    *   Total value of the current offer: 0 + 36 + 147 + 0 + 156 = 339\n    *   Discounted value of the current offer (round 2): 339 * 0.9 = 305.1\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 305.1 < 1029. Accepting the current offer is significantly worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine if there's a counteroffer that Player 1 is likely to accept and that would be more valuable than my outside offer when discounted. Given that Player 1 initially offered very little, it seems they might be trying to get a large share of the items. Let's consider offering a counteroffer that is a bit more generous to Player 1 than their current offer, but still gives me a good amount. I have: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 for myself. This will give player 1: 0 item 1, 1 item 2, 3 item 3, 0 item 4, 3 item 5.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth only 305.1 after discounting, and my outside offer is 1029, I definitely should not accept the current offer. Since this is round 2, I can make a counteroffer.\nI will offer Player 1 the following: [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]. In my opinion, player 1 has offered too little so far and I want to see if I can negotiate further.\n\nMy value from this offer would be:\n\n*   2 units of item 1: 2 * 78 = 156\n*   3 units of item 2: 3 * 36 = 108\n*   5 units of item 3: 5 * 49 = 245\n*   2 units of item 4: 2 * 64 = 128\n*   3 units of item 5: 3 * 52 = 156\n\nTotal: 793\nDiscounted value: 793 * 0.9 = 713.7\nStill less than my outside option, so this is a bluff.\n\nSo it turns out it may be best to simply request more from player 1, even if I walk in round 3.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]}\n",

This means that any deal made in a later round is worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 69 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 84 = 84\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 70 = 140\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 37 = 37\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 12 = 12\n    *   **Total value of current offer:** 0 + 84 + 140 + 37 + 12 = 273\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (273) is better than my outside offer (216).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what a good counteroffer might look like. I want to maximize my value, and I want to do so in a way that Player 1 might accept. Since this is round 1, and there are two more rounds to go, I can be somewhat aggressive in my counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 the minimum necessary for them to be indifferent (to just barely above it) to my outside offer, but ensure I still get value greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer (273) is already above my outside offer (216), accepting it is a viable strategy. However, there is a chance that I can improve the outcome. Let's consider a possible counteroffer to see if it gives greater value. Suppose I counteroffer with giving the other player [1,3,3,2,3]. Then I would retain [0,1,1,0,0]. The value to me would be 1*84+1*70=154. This is worse than my outside option.\n\nAlternatively, I can ask for more of item 2 since I value it highly and Player 1 appears to not value it as much.\n\nI think accepting the offer is reasonable at this stage because it's still early in the game and there is some chance that I can get a higher amount if I reject it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means any deal in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and any deal in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]. This means:\n    *   1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 50 = 50\n    *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   2 units of item 3 = 2 * 62 = 124\n    *   1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 71 = 71\n    *   2 units of item 5 = 2 * 83 = 166\n    *   Total value of current offer = 50 + 70 + 124 + 71 + 166 = 481\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 481. This is less than my outside offer of 664.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I need to keep at least a combination of items worth more than 664 if this negotiation goes through.\n\n    Let's think of a plausible counteroffer. The current offer from Player 1 is [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]. This means they are keeping:\n    * Item 1: 4-1 = 3\n    * Item 2: 4-1 = 3\n    * Item 3: 5-2 = 3\n    * Item 4: 3-1 = 2\n    * Item 5: 6-2 = 4\n\n    Let's calculate the value of this for Player 1 to give us a sense of their valuation. Assume they have a similarly high valuation on all items.\n\n    I could try to get more of item 5 since I value it highly.\n    My current items are [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]. What if I try to keep [2, 2, 3, 2, 4]?\n    This means offering Player 1: [2, 2, 2, 1, 2].\n    My total value would be:\n    2 * 50 + 2 * 70 + 3 * 62 + 2 * 71 + 4 * 83 = 100 + 140 + 186 + 142 + 332 = 900\n    That's greater than 664.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is not good enough. I should make a counteroffer. I'll offer [2, 2, 2, 1, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analysis of the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 664\n*   My values per item: item 1: 50, item 2: 70, item 3: 62, item 4: 71, item 5: 83\n*   Total items: item 1: 4, item 2: 4, item 3: 5, item 4: 3, item 5: 6\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means any deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 1, 2, 1, 4]. This means I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 50 = 100\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 62 = 124\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 71 = 71\n    *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 83 = 332\n    *   Total value of current offer: 100 + 70 + 124 + 71 + 332 = 697\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 697 * 0.9 = 627.3\n\n*   **Compare to Outside Offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (627.3) is less than my outside offer (664).\n\n*   **Consider a Counteroffer:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 an equal division.\n    *   Player 1 would get [2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n    *   I would also get [2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n    *   My value: 2*50 + 2*70 + 3*62 + 2*71 + 3*83 = 100 + 140 + 186 + 142 + 249 = 817\n    *   Discounted Value: 817 * 0.9 = 735.3. This exceeds my outside offer.\n\n    *   Let me think a bit more about possible deals and consider the likelihood of P1 accepting something closer to 50-50 given my values.\n\n    *   I know P1 proposed [2, 1, 2, 1, 4]. Let's calculate what I give to P1 with my old round 1 offer of [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]. I give P1 2*50 + 2*70 + 2*62 + 1*71 + 2*83 = 100 + 140 + 124 + 71 + 166 = 601.  If P1's values are similar enough to mine this may be OK for him, but now I am being offered 697, which isn't much better and I will be discounted.\n\n    *   Instead let me try to be a bit greedy, but close to P1's offer and offer him [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]. This would give me:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 50 = 150\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 70 = 210\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 62 = 186\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 71 = 142\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 83 = 249\n    *   Total value to me: 150 + 210 + 186 + 142 + 249 = 937\n    *   Discounted value to me: 937 * 0.9 = 843.3.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer is less than my outside offer, I should not accept it. I should also not walk away yet, since there is still a chance to get a better deal by making a counteroffer. I will make a counteroffer that attempts to get me as much value as possible while still being somewhat reasonable to Player 1 to avoid a walkaway.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]}\n",

Adjusted by the discount factor, the present value is 347 * 0.9 = 312.3.\n\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 256.\n\n*   **Considering a Counteroffer:** I need to ensure the counteroffer benefits me more than 256/0.9 = 284.4. Currently I am receiving a value of 312.3, so the outside offer is not more beneficial than the current round offer from Player 1.\n\n*   **Previous Round Offer:** My round 1 counteroffer was [0, 4, 0, 2, 1], meaning Player 1 would have received 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. That means I kept 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. So, (2 * 81) + (3 * 37) + (4 * 76) + (1 * 3) + (1 * 18) = 162 + 111 + 304 + 3 + 18 = 598, or a discounted value of 598 * 0.9 = 538.2 had player 1 accepted. This is much better than the value of accepting Player 1's current offer, but it is also a negotiation tactic that can lead to Player 1 leaving. \n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer has a value of 312.3 to me, which is greater than my outside offer of 256.\n*   Accepting the current offer secures a beneficial outcome now, avoiding the risk of a failed negotiation.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Therefore, securing a favorable deal early on is beneficial.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  To maximize my value, I should retain items based on their value to me. The goal is to at least exceed my outside offer value of 167.\n\n  Let's calculate some potential scenarios:\n\n  **Scenario 1: I give Player 2 minimal units to maximize my value.**\n\n  Offer Player 2 the minimal units that I predict might still be beneficial for me. This outline aims to retain most high-value items.\n\n  - Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n  - My retained items: [2, 3, 1, 2, 2]\n\n  Calculation of value for me:\n  - My retained items:\n    - Item 1: 2 units = 2 * 11 = 22\n    - Item 2: 3 units = 3 * 89 = 267\n    - Item 3: 1 unit = 1 * 10 = 10\n    - Item 4: 2 units = 2 * 84 = 168\n    - Item 5: 2 units = 2 * 62 = 124\n  - Total value for me = 22 + 267 + 10 + 168 + 124 = 591\n\nSince 591 exceeds my outside offer and avoids the round 1 discount, it's a viable move. \n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nI should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value and keeps my payoff well above my outside offer.\n\n**My Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n\nThis action ensures I remain above my outside offer value while providing a viable starting point for negotiation.",

In this first round, anything better than my outside offer is a win.\n\n    Since player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], I will try to propose a deal where I get more items, to be able to surpass my outside offer. I will start with getting at least half of the total value and calculate how much I should offer to player 1 to leave me above my outside offer.\n    Since my total value for all items is 786 and my outside offer is 779, I would like to get as many items as possible to exceed my outside offer.\n    I can calculate my total value of items remaining after I offer Player 1 the [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] by:\n    2 units of item 1 = 2*24 = 48\n    3 units of item 2 = 3*89 = 267\n    1 unit of item 3 = 1*32 = 32\n    2 units of item 4 = 2*2 = 4\n    2 units of item 5 = 2*96 = 192\n    Which equals to a value of 543, which is still lower than my outside offer of 779.\n    I should make an offer where I keep as much of my valuable items as possible and offer Player 1 the remainder.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is far below my outside offer, I should definitely not accept.\nLet's try to get all items with a higher value of 50 and offer the remainder. I will offer [3, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n\n*   **My offer:** Player 1 gets [3, 0, 2, 3, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   0 unit of item 1: 0 * 24 = 0\n    *   4 unit of item 2: 4 * 89 = 356\n    *   0 unit of item 3: 0 * 32 = 0\n    *   0 unit of item 4: 0 * 2 = 0\n    *   3 unit of item 5: 3 * 96 = 288\n    *   Total value of current offer: 0 + 356 + 0 + 0 + 288 = 644\n    This value is lower than my outside offer and is not an acceptable offer.\n    I should then walk away from the negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

However, it's crucial to ensure I keep the value close to my outside offer while being appealing enough to encourage negotiation rather than walking away.\n\nProposal:\n   - Offer Player 2: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - This results in me keeping:\n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2 (95 \u00d7 5 = 475)\n     - 5 units of item 3 (93 \u00d7 5 = 465)\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5 (91 \u00d7 3 = 273)\n   - Total value to me = 475 + 465 + 273 = 1213\n\nThis counteroffer does not exceed my outside offer value, and thus would not be strategically favorable. Therefore, given that the counteroffer options evaluated do not surpass my outside offer of 1507, my action is to:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 827\n   - My values for the items: item 1: 67, item 2: 87, item 3: 87, item 4: 97, item 5: 52\n   - Total pool of items: 1 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its undiscounted value to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 1].\n      - Value of this offer to me: (0 * 67) + (2 * 87) + (2 * 87) + (0 * 97) + (1 * 52) = 0 + 174 + 174 + 0 + 52 = 400\n      - Discounted value of accepting this offer now (round 2): 400 * 0.9 = 360\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 360 < 827. Accepting this offer is significantly worse than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer might look like and calculate its value. My goal is to get a discounted value greater than 827. Let's explore some options, keeping in mind that Player 1 will likely want something in return.\n\n   - **Option 1: Give Player 1 the minimum, keep the rest for myself:**\n\n       I give to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n       I keep: [1, 6, 2, 5, 1]\n       Value to me: (1 * 67) + (6 * 87) + (2 * 87) + (5 * 97) + (1 * 52) = 67 + 522 + 174 + 485 + 52 = 1300\n       Discounted value: 1300 * 0.9 = 1170.  This would be great, but Player 1 is unlikely to accept it.\n\n   - **Option 2: A fairer split. Aim for roughly even total values for each player initially (without discounting):**\n\n       My total possible value is 1300. Let's aim for Player 1 to have items worth roughly 500, and I get items worth roughly 800. Remember that Player 1 offered me items valued [0, 2, 2, 0, 1].\n\n       Let's consider offering Player 1 the following: [1, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n       Value to Player 1 (using my values as placeholder, as I do not have Player 1s values) : (1 * 67) + (3 * 87) + (0 * 87) + (3 * 97) + (0 * 52) = 67 + 261 + 0 + 291 + 0 = 619\n\n       If I offer Player 1 [1, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n       Then I keep [0, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n       Value to me: (0 * 67) + (3 * 87) + (2 * 87) + (2 * 97) + (1 * 52) = 0 + 261 + 174 + 194 + 52 = 681\n       Discounted value: 681 * 0.9 = 612.9 This is not better than the outside offer, but we need to make a reasonable offer in hopes they will accept.\n\n   - **Option 3: Improve Option 2 to get closer to outside value**\n\n       Let's consider offering Player 1 the following: [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n       Value to Player 1 (using my values): (1 * 67) + (2 * 87) + (0 * 87) + (2 * 97) + (0 * 52) = 67 + 174 + 0 + 194 + 0 = 435\n\n       If I offer Player 1 [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n       Then I keep [0, 4, 2, 3, 1]\n       Value to me: (0 * 67) + (4 * 87) + (2 * 87) + (3 * 97) + (1 * 52) = 0 + 348 + 174 + 291 + 52 = 865\n       Discounted value: 865 * 0.9 = 778.5 This is still not above outside offer, however we have to also think about whether this is fair or not.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   The current offer is unacceptable. The outside offer is a better choice. I should make a reasonable counteroffer in hopes Player 1 does not WALK. I believe Option 3 [1, 2, 0, 2, 0] will be fair. If this is rejected I will WALK next round.\n    \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]}\n",

This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 6, 0, 1, 2].  This means I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   6 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is:\n    *   (0 * 94) + (6 * 5) + (0 * 29) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 49) = 0 + 30 + 0 + 6 + 98 = 134\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (134) is less than my outside offer value (248).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to formulate a counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer. I also need to consider what Player 1 might accept. Since I highly value item 1, and they seem to not value item 2 much, and give me almost all of it, I should propose to give them most of item 2 and ask for a large share of item 1.\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    This means I would keep:\n    *   5 units of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this would be:\n    *   (5 * 94) + (0 * 5) + (2 * 29) + (2 * 6) + (2 * 49) = 470 + 0 + 58 + 12 + 98 = 638\n\n    This is much greater than my outside offer. Let's consider an intermediate counteroffer where I give Player 1: [2, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    This means I would keep:\n    *   3 units of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this would be:\n    *   (3 * 94) + (0 * 5) + (2 * 29) + (2 * 6) + (2 * 49) = 282 + 0 + 58 + 12 + 98 = 450\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not good enough, since 134 < 248.\n*   I should not accept the current offer.\n*   A counteroffer of [2, 6, 0, 0, 0] would give me a value of 450, and gives all of the useless item 2 to Player 1.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of [2, 6, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 6, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 57) + (3 * 95) + (0 * 5) + (3 * 97) + (0 * 24) = 0 + 285 + 0 + 291 + 0 = 576\n    *   Since 576 > 37, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*. However, let's see if a counteroffer could be even better.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I have to give items to Player 1. I currently have 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I aim for an even split of the high-value items (items 2 and 4) and keep most of items 1, 3, and 5.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1349. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 900 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1239. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1122 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 1239.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 72, item 2 = 57, item 3 = 81, item 4 = 94, item 5 = 70.\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value. This incentivizes me to accept a reasonable offer now rather than risk a worse outcome later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** The current offer on the table is [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me:\n      - 0 units of item 1\n      - 1 unit of item 2\n      - 1 unit of item 3\n      - 3 units of item 4\n      - 0 units of item 5\n\n      The value of this offer to me is:\n      (0 * 72) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 81) + (3 * 94) + (0 * 70) = 0 + 57 + 81 + 282 + 0 = 420\n\n      Comparing this to my outside offer: 420 < 1239. So accepting this offer now is much worse than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I want to formulate a counteroffer that gives Player 1 enough to accept, but still leaves me with more than my outside offer. Let's calculate the total value of all items to me:\n      (2 * 72) + (3 * 57) + (4 * 81) + (7 * 94) + (2 * 70) = 144 + 171 + 324 + 658 + 140 = 1437\n    \n      Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 the following: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n      My value for this split would be:\n      (1 * 72) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 81) + (3 * 94) + (1 * 70) = 72 + 57 + 81 + 282 + 70 = 562.\n\n      Therefore, Player 1's allocation would be worth 1437 - 562 = 875 to Player 1 (based on my valuations), which may not be enough for them.\n      Let's also examine a potential offer of me offering them half of all items. Since there is an even number of item 1, 3 and 5 we will have to round down.\n\n      Offering Player 1: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\n      That would give myself: 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\n      My Value = (1 * 72) + (2 * 57) + (2 * 81) + (4 * 94) + (1 * 70) = 72 + 114 + 162 + 376 + 70 = 794. Which is less than my outside offer.\n\n      To ensure my offer is worth more than 1239, let's propose to offer Player 1 the following: [0,0,0,0,0].\n      My value = (2 * 72) + (3 * 57) + (4 * 81) + (7 * 94) + (2 * 70) = 144 + 171 + 324 + 658 + 140 = 1437\n      It is likely that this offer will be denied as their offer to me would be 0.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is terrible for me.\n   - A counteroffer is better than accepting the current offer but risk losing some value in the future round due to the discount rate.\n   - Since my outside offer is 1239 and the max total value I could receive is 1437, and this is only round 1, I am going to propose a counter offer of [0,0,0,0,0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 343. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of accepting in round 1, and accepting in round 3 is worth 0.81 (0.9 * 0.9) times the value of accepting in round 1.\n\n2)  **Assessment of the Offer:**\n\nThe current offer is [6, 2, 2, 4, 2], meaning I receive:\n\n*   6 units of item 1\n*   2 units of item 2\n*   2 units of item 3\n*   4 units of item 4\n*   2 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n\n*   (6 * 39) + (2 * 14) + (2 * 64) + (4 * 84) + (2 * 50) = 234 + 28 + 128 + 336 + 100 = 826\n\nThis value (826) is significantly higher than my outside offer (268).\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer.  To do that, I would need to figure out what Player 1 values the items, and what kind of split they would accept. Without knowing their values, I can only reason based on my own values. I have no idea if a split more advantageous to me would be accepted.\n\n3)  **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (826) is significantly higher than my outside offer (268), it's beneficial to accept the current offer. There is a chance I could get more value by making a counteroffer and the other player accepting it but there is also the risk the negotiation breaks down and I get my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Based on the calculation above, offering [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] to the other player results in a payoff of 1400 for me, which is greater than my outside offer.

This is much lower than my outside option.\n\n   - Consider a more favorable counteroffer, maximizing my value:\n     - I need a total value greater than my outside offer of 641.\n     - Possible offer: [0, 0, 1, 4, 0] \u2014 value for me:\n       - I keep 6 - 0 = 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 95 = 570\n       - I keep 1 - 0 = 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 36 = 36\n       - I keep 4 - 1 = 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n       - I keep 8 - 4 = 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n       - I keep 0 - 0 = 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n       - Total Value = 570 + 36 + 177 + 192 + 0 = 975\n\n3. **Decision Making:**\n   - I should propose a counteroffer, as the current offer value of 202 is far below my outside offer value of 641.\n   - My calculated counteroffer gives me a value of 975, above both the current offer and my outside option.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 4, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) Current Situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 1293\n   - My values per item: item 1: 99, item 2: 19, item 3: 69, item 4: 97, item 5: 80\n   - Total items: item 1: 6, item 2: 1, item 3: 4, item 4: 8, item 5: 0\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted now is worth more than the same offer accepted in the future.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: I receive [0, 0, 1, 4, 0]. This means Player 1 gets [6, 1, 3, 4, 0].\n   - My value for the current offer: (0 * 99) + (0 * 19) + (1 * 69) + (4 * 97) + (0 * 80) = 0 + 0 + 69 + 388 + 0 = 457.\n   - Since it is round 2, the discounted value is 457 * 0.9^(2-1) = 457 * 0.9 = 411.3.\n   - This value (411.3) is significantly less than my outside offer value of 1293.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since Player 1 is offering me very little, I need to demand more to make a deal worthwhile. I need to get at least 1293 / 0.9 = 1436.67 value in this round to beat my outside offer.\n\nLet's calculate the total value if I get everything.\nTotal Value = (6 * 99) + (1 * 19) + (4 * 69) + (8 * 97) + (0 * 80) = 594 + 19 + 276 + 776 + 0 = 1665.\n\nLet's try to come up with a reasonable counteroffer. I need to get enough value for it to be worthwhile, but not be so greedy that Player 1 will just walk away.\n\nI'm going to make an aggressive counteroffer that gives player 1 very little.\n\nMy counteroffer will be [5, 1, 3, 7, 0] to Player 1. This means I get [1, 0, 1, 1, 0].\nMy value: (1 * 99) + (0 * 19) + (1 * 69) + (1 * 97) + (0 * 80) = 99 + 0 + 69 + 97 + 0 = 265.\nThe discounted value is 265 * 0.9 = 238.5. This is much lower than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 even less.\n\nMy counteroffer will be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\nThis means I get [6, 1, 4, 8, 0]\nMy value is 1665. The discounted value is 1665 * 0.9 = 1498.5. This is greater than my outside offer value of 1293.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer is not good, because it's worth 411.3, while my outside offer is 1293.\n   - I will propose a counteroffer that gives player 1 nothing.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Therefore, the counteroffer must at least yield a value greater than my outside offer.\n     - Given my outside offer value is 641, I need a counteroffer that values at least this much (pre-discounting it).\n\n   - Let's explore one potential counteroffer where I prioritize more valuable items:\n     - Counteroffer: [3, 0, 2, 4, 0]\n       - My value on receiving:\n         - 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 95 = 285\n         - 0 units of item 2 = 0 * 36 = 0\n         - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 59 = 118\n         - 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 48 = 192\n         - 0 units of item 5 = 0 * 67 = 0\n       - Total value = 285 + 0 + 118 + 192 + 0 = 595\n       - Adjusted by discount factor: 595 * 0.81 = 481.95, which is less than my outside offer value of 641.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - My calculated value of any feasible offer under the current constraints after discounting does not exceed my outside offer.\n   - There seems to be no viable counteroffer left in my rounds that might secure a deal above my outside offer value, due to the discount effect.\n   - Therefore, the safest economic action is to WALK away with my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This means that the outcome's value will be slightly reduced in future rounds, which encourages quicker resolution.\n\n2) Assess potential counteroffers (since there is no current offer):\n   - I need to create a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 521 after considering the discount rate.\n   - Let's try an initial division that might favor my higher valued items. For instance, let's offer fewer units of the items I value more (items 1, 3, and 4) and more of the others (items 2 and 5).\n\n   One possible offer: \n   - Offer 2 units of item 1 to Player 2, keeping 4 for myself.\n   - Offer 1 unit of item 2 to Player 2, keeping 2 for myself.\n   - Offer 2 units of item 3 to Player 2, keeping 3 for myself.\n   - Offer 2 unit of item 4 to Player 2, keeping 4 for myself.\n   - Offer 3 units of item 5 to Player 2, keeping 1 for myself.\n\n   Calculate the value to me with this division:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 70 = 280\n   - 1 units of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n   \n   Total value = 216 + 68 + 261 + 280 + 13 = 838\n\n   This value is greater than my outside offer, even when considering a minor discount factor for future rounds.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - I will make a counteroffer based on the calculation above, as it holds significant value over my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 2, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 362. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 711 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's consider a few options. Since I value item 3 and item 4 highly, let's explore an offer where I get most or all of those.

Let's assume I want to try and get close to my maximum, but offer Player 1 some value. To calculate max I use: (4 x 75) + (2 x 12) + (1 x 57) + (3 x 20) + (3 x 33) = 300 + 24 + 57 + 60 + 99 = 540\n\n    Let me consider giving Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That would give me 540. If I give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] then I have:\n    *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 75 = 300\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 12 = 24\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 20 = 40\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 33 = 66\n    *   Total value: 300 + 24 + 57 + 40 + 66 = 487\n\n    Another counteroffer: Give Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n    I get:\n    *   3 unit of item 1: 3 * 75 = 225\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 12 = 12\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 57 = 57\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 20 = 40\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 33 = 66\n    *   Total value: 225 + 12 + 57 + 40 + 66 = 400\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 262, which is slightly better than my outside offer of 260.\n*   I could counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal, but there's a risk Player 1 might walk away or reject my counteroffer, leading to my outside offer being my only option, and discounted in the next round.\n*   Given that the current offer is slightly better than my outside offer, and considering the discount factor, it's reasonable to accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

The value is multiplied by gamma to the power of (r-1), and since r = 1 for this round, it makes no difference initially.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - I do not have a current offer to accept since this is the initial round and no offers have been made yet.\n   - To make a potential counteroffer, I should consider different divisions. A potential strategy here is to start by keeping the items with higher per-unit value to me. My current goal is to have a total value greater than 142.\n   - Let's calculate a counteroffer that maximizes my initial return. An idea is to offer fewer of the items that are highly valued to me and more of those that are less valuable:\n\nExample counteroffer proposal:\n   - Offer player 2: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n   - Keep for myself: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n   - Calculate the value I accrue from this offer:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n     - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 19 = 76\n     - Total value = 8 + 72 + 168 + 100 + 76 = 424\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since my calculated total value (424) from this proposal is significantly above my outside offer value (142), I am inclined to make an initial counteroffer rather than walking away or accepting no current offer.\n\nGiven this reasoning, here is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 2, 1, 5]}\n```",

I need to adjust this offer.\n\n### Optimizing the Counteroffer:\n\nTo optimize, I aim to increase my retention of high-value items or decrease the offer on low-value items.\n\n- Adjust to keep: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n- Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n\n**Value now:**\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n- Total value = 978\n\nEven though offering all high-value items is not feasible within constraints, approaching closely preserves negotiation leverage.\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\n\nSince my current offers do not surpass my outside offer value of 1078, I realize I need a different distribution, or I may need to consider walking if I cannot align values exceptionally well. Here is a more balanced attempt given constraints:\n\n### Counteroffer\n\nSince the offer is close but not above outside value, we risk negotiation or retrace:\n\n- Offer Player 2 (more realistic):\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 1 units of item 5\n\nLet's proceed with this balanced counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - Value of current offer: (0 * 98) + (1 * 86) + (3 * 62) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 62) = 0 + 86 + 186 + 6 + 62 = 340\n   - Comparison to outside offer: 340 < 516.  The current offer is worth less than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n   - I need to offer Player 1 some items, keeping the rest for myself.\n   - I want to maximize my value, taking into account the discount factor if we don't reach an agreement in this round.\n   - My total value of all items is 1164.\n   - If I make a counteroffer and it's rejected, the next round will be worth 0.9 * (potential value), and if that's rejected, the final round has value 0.81 * (potential value), or else we both just get our outside options.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I aim for at least my outside offer value. I need to get at least 516 of value to consider accepting a deal. Let's try to give player 1 just enough so that *they* will accept it.\n\nIf I give Player 1 the following, here is what I keep:\nOffer: [3, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nMy items:\n0 units of item 1 = 0 * 98 = 0\n1 units of item 2 = 1 * 86 = 86\n4 units of item 3 = 4 * 62 = 248\n3 units of item 4 = 3 * 2 = 6\n3 units of item 5 = 3 * 62 = 186\nTotal value = 0 + 86 + 248 + 6 + 186 = 526\n\n526 > 516 (outside offer).\n\nNow I need to check if it's better to walk. Walking gets me 516 now.\nIf Player 1 accepts the above offer, I get 526 now. So it's better than walking.\n\nNow let's check if I can do better. Player 1 asked for [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]. If I give them only slightly more, I can keep more value.\nThe counteroffer has to be something that Player 1 would potentially accept.\n\nI think the above offer maximizes my value.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [3, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Therefore, I should either walk away or propose a counteroffer that could potentially exceed my outside offer value.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that could potentially maximize my value: \n\n- Keeping items that provide the highest value: item 1, 4, and 5.\n- Suggested counteroffer: [0, 5, 4, 0, 0] \n- Calculation for my potential holding: \n  - Item 1: 3 units worth 300\n  - Item 4: 3 units worth 270\n  - Item 5: 3 units worth 285 \n  - Total value with this configuration = 300 + 270 + 285 = 855\n  - Discounted value in round 2 = 855 * 0.9 = 769.5\n\nEven with this configuration, the value is lower than my outside offer. Hence, walking away could be my best option if further desirable counteroffers can't be gained.\n\nTaking into account all these calculations, I will propose a counteroffer aimed to achieve a marginally higher value if possible, emphasizing my interest in high-value items.

For round 1, this doesn't affect my decision much, but should be considered for future rounds if necessary.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - First, I need to consider a division that gives me a total value above 601 (my outside offer), as a starting point.\n\nOne potential offer I could give to Player 2 might be minimal, making sure I receive a higher total value from my share than my outside offer of 601. For example, if I keep significant portions of higher value items:\n\n**Sample Offer to Player 2**:\n- [1, 1, 2, 2] might be a good start where:\n  - I give Player 2:\n    - 1 unit of Item 2\n    - 1 unit of Item 3\n    - 2 units of Item 4\n    - 2 units of Item 5\n\nI will calculate the total value of items left for me:\n- **My Share**:\n  - 3 units of Item 2: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - 4 units of Item 3: 4 \u00d7 69 = 276\n  - 2 units of Item 4: 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n  - 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n\n  Total value = 15 + 276 + 168 + 35 = 494\n\nSince this total value (494) is less than my outside offer of 601, it\u2019s not acceptable.\n\nI need to keep trying different combinations to ensure I keep a total value above 601 or decide another action.\n\n**Possible Counter when maximizing my gain:**\n- [0, 2, 0, 0] to Player 2 (meaning):\n  - I give 0 units of Item 2\n  - I give 2 units of Item 3\n  - I give 0 units of Item 4\n  - I give 0 units of Item 5\n\n**Calculation**:\n- **My Share**:\n  - 4 units of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n  - 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n  - 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 84 = 336\n  - 3 units of Item 5: 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n  \n  Total value = 20 + 207 + 336 + 105 = 668\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven that this counteroffer value (668) is greater than my outside offer (601), I will make this counteroffer to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

In round 2, the value is discounted by 0.9 since gamma is applied as gamma^(r-1), where r is the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] means I receive:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 16\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n     - Total value = 16\n   - Present value = 16 * 0.9 = 14.4, which is much less than my outside offer of 184.\n   \n   - I will assess a counteroffer that gives Player 2 a reasonable amount but still ensures I receive more than my outside offer. For example:\n     - Offer [1, 1, 3, 2, 1] to Player 2, keeping [1, 1, 4, 3, 0] for myself, let's calculate the value:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 33\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 73\n       - 4 units of item 3 = 64 (4 * 16)\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 96 (3 * 32)\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n       - Total value = 266\n       - Present value = 266 * 0.9 = 239.4\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer will give me 14.4, which is not favorable.\n   - Walking away provides me 184, which is better than the current offer.\n   - Counteroffering [1, 1, 3, 2, 1] gives me a present value of 239.4, which is significantly better than the outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should propose the counteroffer to try and secure a better deal.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]}\n```",

This is far less than my outside offer of 560.\n*   Walking away guarantees me 560.\n*   I need to consider if a counteroffer could yield a higher value than 560, considering the discount factor. This is the second round, so the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nLet's consider a possible, aggressive counteroffer. I want to give as little as possible. The current offer to player 1 is [1, 1, 3, 2, 1] which means I have [1, 1, 4, 3, 0].\n\nMy value for those items is (1*47) + (1*31) + (4*51) + (3*30) = 47 + 31 + 204 + 90 = 372. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nSince this is round 2, and it is unlikely player 1 will offer more value, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

The value of waiting needs to outweigh the loss from the discount.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n    *   Current offer: \\[1, 1, 3, 1, 4] (This is what Player 1 is offering to *me*).\n    *   My values for this offer:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 63 = 63\n        *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 73 = 73\n        *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 66 = 198\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 15 = 15\n        *   4 units of item 5: 4 * 25 = 100\n        *   Total value of current offer: 63 + 73 + 198 + 15 + 100 = 449\n\n    *   How the current offer compares to my outside offer: 449 < 591. Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n3.  **Consider a potential counteroffer:** I need to consider what I would give to Player 1 so what I keep is worth more than my outside offer of 591. This also needs to consider Player 1s values as well, so I should keep more of what they value less. As I don't know Player 1's values, the best approach is to try and maximise my own and hope they accept. If they don't, I will still walk with my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider keeping all the items to myself. My value for that would be:\n\n    *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 63 = 315\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 73 = 73\n    *   7 units of item 3: 7 * 66 = 462\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 15 = 30\n    *   8 units of item 5: 8 * 25 = 200\n\n    This would be a counter offer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and it is worth a total to me of 315 + 73 + 462 + 30 + 200 = 1080.\n    Since this is the first round, and I can propose a counteroffer and get value 1080 this round, or walk away, this is my best option.\n\n4.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    Since the current offer (449) is less than my outside offer (591), and proposing a counteroffer and keeping all items is my maximum possible value, I should make this as the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 492. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 2, the discount will not influence the value yet as it affects from round 3 onwards.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the offers:**\n   - For the current offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], my value is 0 as I receive nothing.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I need to calculate my value of keeping various divisions of items. A potential counteroffer should maximize my return while being reasonable to Player 2. \n   - If I offer Player 2 [2, 0, 4, 0, 4], my value would be:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n     - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 1 = 4\n     - Total value = 484\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer yields no value to me.\n   - A counteroffer of [2, 0, 4, 0, 4] gives me a value of 484, which is slightly below my outside offer of 492, but this may have potential for further negotiation.\n   - Walking away guarantees me a value of 492.\n\nConsidering these computations, and given that we still have another round left, it would be strategic to propose a counteroffer close to my outside offer with the possibility of negotiation in the next round.

My outside offer is 591. Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**  I need to consider what divisions are possible and their value to me. The current offer to me leaves Player 1 with [3, 1, 3, 2, 4]. Let's consider some scenarios.\n\n   - **Giving Player 1 everything:** Value to me = 0.\n   - **Leaving Player 1 with nothing:** Value to me = (5 * 63) + (1 * 73) + (7 * 66) + (2 * 15) + (8 * 25) = 315 + 73 + 462 + 30 + 200 = 1080. Discounted in round 3 that will be 1080*0.9 = 972\n   - **Let's try to create a counteroffer that is slightly better than my walkaway for round 3** If I aim to get 660 in the next round (meaning 660*0.9 ~ 591, which is my current walkaway), I need to give items that amount to the value of 1080-660 = 420 to player 1.\n\n  I can give:\n  - Items 1: 63\n  - Items 2: 73\n  - Items 3: 66\n  - Items 4: 15\n  - Items 5: 25\n\n  I think I will make the following offer:\n\n  [1,0,1,0,0] for Player 1\n  My Items are: 4*63 + 1*73 + 6*66 + 2*15 + 8*25 = 252+73+396+30+200 = 951\n  951 * 0.9 = 855.9\n\n  [2,0,2,0,0] for Player 1\n\n  My Items are: 3*63 + 1*73 + 5*66 + 2*15 + 8*25 = 189+73+330+30+200 = 822\n  822 * 0.9 = 739.8\n\nI will provide the following counteroffer:\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is not acceptable.

Thus, a deal's value would be the direct calculated value of the items multiplied by 0.81.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - For the current offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], the total value is:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 -> 69 \u00d7 1 = 69\n     - 0 units of item 2 -> 75 \u00d7 0 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3 -> 16 \u00d7 1 = 16\n     - 0 units of item 4 -> 75 \u00d7 0 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 -> 1 \u00d7 0 = 0\n     - Total value = 69 + 16 = 85\n     - Adjusted for discount = 85 \u00d7 0.81 = 68.85\n\n   - Since the adjusted value of the current offer (68.85) is far below my outside offer value (492), this offer is clearly unacceptable.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The current offer is significantly less valuable than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away gives me a value of 492, which is much better than the current offer.\n\nConsidering these factors, the rational decision is to walk away and take the outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
