Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 554. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 360 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I'll first go through the analysis and considerations step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is **554**.\n   - My private values for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 8\n     - Item 2: 15\n     - Item 3: 54\n     - Item 4: 34\n     - Item 5: 9\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor affects future rounds by reducing the value of potential agreements, especially if we wait until later rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   Since there is currently no offer from Player 2 to accept, I need to consider what counteroffer to propose. To ensure a profitable outcome, my retained portion must at least match my outside offer value of 554 after considering any potential discounting.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   I will aim to make an initial offer that allows me to retain a value equal to or greater than my outside offer value.\n\n   Let's calculate potential counteroffers by considering retaining a combination that gives at least 554 in value:\n\n   I'll evaluate keeping higher-value items, particularly item 3 and item 4:\n\n   Proposal to Player 2:\n   - Let's try offering 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n\n   My retained units would be:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n\n   Total value retained = 16 + 30 + 162 + 102 + 27 = 337\n\n   This does not meet my outside offer. So, let's keep more from the higher valued items:\n\n   Adjust Proposal: Offer 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5:\n\n   My retained units:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n   - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 34 = 136\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n\n   Total value retained = 16 + 15 + 216 + 136 + 27 = 410\n\n   Adjust more: Keep more item 4:\n\n   Offer 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5:\n\n   My retained units:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 34 = 170\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n\n   Total value retained = 16 + 15 + 216 + 170 + 27 = 444\n\n   While 444 is still under 554, higher valued items like item 3 retain value better for me. I'll make a proposal sacrificing lower value. I need to balance more consistently to get a higher value retention or adjust down to check more efficiency. \n\n   Proposal to Player 2:\n   - Offer: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\n   My retained units:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n   - 3 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n   - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 54 = 270\n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 34 = 170\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n\n   Total value retained = 24 + 30 + 270 + 170 + 27 = 521\n\n   Even after multiple configurations, I am unable to surpass 554 as retained after a proposal because I may be overly sacrificing value against alternatives possible, especially on higher potential units comparison of item 2 initially. Let's have a final adjustment, focusing on trimming from item 3 more:\n\n   Try offer: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\n   My retained units:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 34 = 170\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n\n   Total value retained = 24 + 45 + 216 + 170 + 27 = 482\n\n   Even with revisions to distribute balance about item 3 while maintaining others, achieving 554 is a sustained obstacle without reaching generous restructure. Alternatively, consider an offer below or direct notice:\n\n   Rather than reject for limited feasibility, and considering vague outlet on countergap currently around structuring, propose:\n\n   {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 677\n   - Item values: item 1: 48, item 2: 100, item 3: 16, item 4: 45, item 5: 87\n   - Total items: item 1: 5, item 2: 4, item 3: 3, item 4: 3, item 5: 4\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I get 1 unit of each item. This means I keep 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n      - Value to me: (4 * 48) + (3 * 100) + (2 * 16) + (2 * 45) + (3 * 87) = 192 + 300 + 32 + 90 + 261 = 875\n      - Since 875 > 677, accepting this offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to consider if I can get an even better deal by making a counteroffer. Since this is round 1, there are two more rounds of negotiation.\n\n3) **Decision-Making:**\n   - The current offer is worth 875 to me, which is greater than my outside offer of 677. Therefore, accepting the offer is better than walking away.\n   - However, there are still two rounds of negotiation left. I could try to get an even better deal.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 something slightly less favorable to me. For example, I could try offering them [2, 2, 2, 2, 2].\nIf I offer Player 1 [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], that means I keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\nValue to me: (3 * 48) + (2 * 100) + (1 * 16) + (1 * 45) + (2 * 87) = 144 + 200 + 16 + 45 + 174 = 579. This is less than my outside offer of 677, making the offer worse than walking away and would be Mistake 2.\n\nThe current offer to me is worth 875. My outside offer is 677. I'll make a counteroffer that is worse than the initial acceptance for me, but will still be better than my outside offer.\n\nCounteroffer: I will offer Player 1 [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I keep 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\nValue to me: (3 * 48) + (3 * 100) + (2 * 16) + (2 * 45) + (3 * 87) = 144 + 300 + 32 + 90 + 261 = 827.\nThis is still greater than my outside offer value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 248\n*   **My values of the items:** item 1: 26, item 2: 95, item 3: 24, item 4: 19, item 5: 18\n*   **Total pool of items:** item 1: 4, item 2: 4, item 3: 3, item 4: 5, item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]. This means they offer me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value if I accept this offer is:\n    *   (0 * 26) + (0 * 95) + (3 * 24) + (1 * 19) + (1 * 18) = 0 + 0 + 72 + 19 + 18 = 109\n\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:** The current offer is worth 109 to me, which is less than my outside offer of 248.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 enough to accept. Here's what I have to work with:\n    *   Item 1: 4 units, value 26 each\n    *   Item 2: 4 units, value 95 each\n    *   Item 3: 0 units remaining for me if I accept the current offer\n    *   Item 4: 4 units remaining for me if I accept the current offer\n    *   Item 5: 2 units remaining for me if I accept the current offer\n\n    Let's consider a few counteroffers. I need to keep at least enough to exceed my outside offer of 248.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Giving Player 1 only the third item back.\n        I get [4, 4, 0, 4, 2], therefore my value is 4*26 + 4*95 + 0*24 + 4*19 + 2*18 = 104 + 380 + 0 + 76 + 36 = 596\n        I offer [0, 0, 3, 1, 1] to Player 1\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** Giving Player 1: [1, 1, 3, 2, 2] to player 1\n        I get [3, 3, 0, 3, 1] therefore my value is 3*26 + 3*95 + 0*24 + 3*19 + 1*18 = 78 + 285 + 0 + 57 + 18 = 438\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (109) is worse than my outside offer (248). So I should not accept.\n*   I need to make a counteroffer that gives me more than 248. I think offering a counteroffer like so to player 1:\n    *   Offering Player 1: [0, 0, 3, 1, 1] would yield me the highest return.\n\nTherefore, I will make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1081. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's proceed through the questions step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1081.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 57\n     - Item 2: 79\n     - Item 3: 2\n     - Item 4: 92\n     - Item 5: 31\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - Item 1: 4\n     - Item 2: 4\n     - Item 3: 3\n     - Item 4: 5\n     - Item 5: 3\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.9. This means any deal reached in this last round won't be discounted over future rounds, as this is the final round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer for me: [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n     - Value from item 3: 2 units \u00d7 2 value = 4\n     - Value from item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 31 value = 31\n     - Total value = 4 + 31 = 35. This is far below my outside offer value of 1081.\n   - Considering the counteroffer: I need to ensure the total value of the items I propose to keep is greater than my outside offer value of 1081.\n\n3) **Strategy for a counteroffer:**\n   - The goal is to keep as much value as possible while making the offer potentially acceptable.\n   - A potential offer could be `[2, 2, 1, 2, 2]`, where I keep:\n     - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 57 = 114\n     - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 79 = 158\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 92 = 276\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 31 = 31\n     - Total = 114 + 158 + 4 + 276 + 31 = 583, which is still less than the outside offer value, so I will try another configuration.\n   - A more favorable distribution for me might be `[4, 4, 2, 0, 2]`, where I keep:\n     - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 2 = 2\n     - Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 92 = 460\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 31 = 31\n     - Total = 2 + 460 + 31 = 493, which is also below the outside offer value. Given the final round, there's no counteroffer that can exceed 1081 at this stage.\n\nGiven that neither the current offer nor any plausible counteroffer would exceed my outside offer value of 1081, and considering that any counteroffer will be treated as a walk since it's the last round, the optimal action is clear:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 187\n*   **Values of the items:**\n    *   Item 1: 44\n    *   Item 2: 6\n    *   Item 3: 72\n    *   Item 4: 71\n    *   Item 5: 6\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 2\n    *   Item 2: 3\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.

This means Player 1 keeps:\n    *   Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 2 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n\n    My value if I accept the current offer:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 44 = 44\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 6 = 12\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 72 = 72\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 71 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 6 = 6\n    *   Total value = 44 + 12 + 72 + 0 + 6 = 134\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I will consider making a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a fair share of the items while ensuring my value exceeds my outside offer.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer has a value of 134, which is less than my outside offer of 187. Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer. I will make a counteroffer, as walking away immediately might be suboptimal. I will try to get closer to my outside offer and also consider giving Player 1 something reasonable to accept.\n\nI will propose offering Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] (meaning I keep 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5)\n\nMy value if Player 1 accepts this counteroffer:\n    *   2 unit of item 1: 2 * 44 = 88\n    *   2 unit of item 2: 2 * 6 = 12\n    *   3 unit of item 3: 3 * 72 = 216\n    *   2 unit of item 4: 2 * 71 = 142\n    *   3 unit of item 5: 3 * 6 = 18\n    *   Total value = 88 + 12 + 216 + 142 + 18 = 476\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

However, as rounds progress, the value will multiply by gamma raised to the power of (r-1), so careful consideration is necessary if talks extend.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value**: There is no current offer on the table, so it holds no value.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose a division where what I keep is worth more than 665.\n\nHere's a potential distribution where I keep most of the items:\n   - Give Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n   - Keep for myself:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 (worth 56)\n     - 3 units of item 2 (worth 213)\n     - 3 units of item 3 (worth 153)\n     - 2 units of item 4 (worth 144)\n     - 2 units of item 5 (worth 48)\n   - Total value I keep: 614.\n   - After discount factor (0.9^0 since it's round 1): 614.\n   - Since 614 < 665, this is not acceptable.\n\nLet's revise the numbers to aim for a higher value:\n   - Give Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - Keep for myself:\n     - 2 units of item 1 (worth 112)\n     - 2 units of item 2 (worth 142)\n     - 4 units of item 3 (worth 204)\n     - 3 units of item 4 (worth 216)\n     - 1 unit of item 5 (worth 24)\n   - Total value I keep: 698.\n   - After discount factor (0.9^0 since it's round 1): 698.\n   - Since 698 > 665, this is acceptable.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nBased on the calculations, I'll propose the above counteroffer that ensures my value exceeds my outside offer. Therefore, I should make a counteroffer ensuring I end up with items worth more than 665. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

The current offer means that I would get 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.

An early resolution is generally preferable.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table from Player 2.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's evaluate several divisions to see which gives me a value higher than my outside offer of 70. I'll start by considering keeping more favorable items based on my values:\n\n  - A potential offer giving 2 units of item 5 to Player 2 and keeping all other items:\n    - **Items Kept:**\n      - Item 1: 1 unit * 54 = 54\n      - Item 2: 4 units * 91 = 364\n      - Item 3: 4 units * 31 = 124\n      - Item 4: 5 units * 51 = 255\n      - Item 5: 4 units * 31 = 124\n    - **Total Value:** 54 + 364 + 124 + 255 + 124 = 921\n  \n  This value (921) is considerably higher than my outside offer (70), so it is a valid and preferable offer from my perspective.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nGiven the situation and calculations:\n- **Do not accept** (no offer to accept).\n- **Do not walk** as possible offers above the outside offer value exist.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer** giving Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] units (offering 0 of items 1-4 and 2 of item 5).\n\nThis strategy maximizes my payoff while leaving some room for negotiation. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], meaning I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - My value if I accept the current offer:\n     - I get 0 * 26 + 0 * 7 + 0 * 36 + 0 * 58 + 2 * 70 = 140.\n   - This value is significantly less than my outside offer of 702.\n\n3) **Consider Counteroffers:** I need to decide on a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 702. I have items: 1 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 4 of item 5 to keep for myself in any counteroffer.\n-Keeping all items for myself would give 1 * 26 + 4 * 7 + 4 * 36 + 5 * 58 + 4 * 70 = 26 + 28 + 144 + 290 + 280 = 768\n\nGiven the above analysis, I should not accept the current offer, as it is far below my outside offer. A reasonable counteroffer will involve receiving the bulk of the high value items. I will make a counteroffer that secures me a good portion of the items while leaving some for Player 1 to ensure they don't simply walk away.\n\nI'll offer Player 1 only a small amount of the lower value items 2 and 3, and one of item 4 while keeping all item 1 and item 5.\nMy counteroffer will be [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nThis offer leaves me with:\n1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 26 = 26\n3 units of item 2 = 3 * 7 = 21\n3 units of item 3 = 3 * 36 = 108\n4 units of item 4 = 4 * 58 = 232\n6 units of item 5 = 6 * 70 = 420\nTotal Value = 26 + 21 + 108 + 232 + 420 = 807\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 702 and thus better for me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Let\u2019s try to keep more valuable items like item 1 and item 5.\n\n**Another Attempt:**\n  - Give 4 units of item 2 to Player 2: Keeping 1 for myself gives me 41\n  - Give 0 units of item 3 to Player 2: Keeping all gives me 130\n  - Give 0 units of item 5 to Player 2: Keeping all gives me 297\n\n  **My total value with this offer:** 41 + 130 + 56 + 297 = 524\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- The new attempt gives me a value of 524, which is above my outside offer of 451.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 657.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1: 26, item 2: 100, item 3: 18, item 4: 66, item 5: 9.\n*   The total pool of items is: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less. Specifically, an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer gives me [5, 4, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   5 units of item 1 = 5 * 26 = 130\n    *   4 units of item 2 = 4 * 100 = 400\n    *   0 units of item 3 = 0 * 18 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 66 = 66\n    *   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 9 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer = 130 + 400 + 0 + 66 + 0 = 596\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (596) is less than my outside offer (657).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I could offer Player 1 to get a better deal for myself than 657.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth less than my outside offer, I should not accept it. I can either walk away or make a counteroffer. Let's consider a counteroffer.\n\nI want to keep as much of item 2 as possible since it has the highest value for me. Let's consider offering Player 1 all of item 1, item 3, item 4 and item 5, and only 1 unit of item 2. This will give me:\n* 5 - 1 = 4 units of item 2: 4 * 100 = 400\n* 0 items of item 1,3,4,5: 0\nThis gives me a total of 400, way below my outside offer and unacceptable.\n\nSo I need to get more units of item 2 to achieve my outside offer. Let's analyze further. The other player is offering [5,4,0,1,0] to me. This means that I am giving the other player [0,1,2,0,3]. In the first round, I can be more greedy. Let me test a counteroffer of [5, 1, 2, 1, 3].\n\nThis gives me a total value of 657.\n\n    *   0 units of item 1 = 0 * 26 = 0\n    *   4 units of item 2 = 4 * 100 = 400\n    *   0 units of item 3 = 0 * 18 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4 = 0 * 66 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 9 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer = 0 + 400 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 400\n\nTherefore it is optimal to give Player 1 [0,1,2,0,3].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 3]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 657\n*   Item values: Item 1 = 26, Item 2 = 100, Item 3 = 18, Item 4 = 66, Item 5 = 9\n*   Total items: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I receive [5, 1, 1, 1, 0]. This means:\n    *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 26 = 130\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 100 = 100\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 18 = 18\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 66 = 66\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 9 = 0\n    *   Total value = 130 + 100 + 18 + 66 + 0 = 314\n    *   Discounted value (round 2) = 314 * 0.9 = 282.6\n*   My outside offer is 657. Accepting the current offer (discounted) yields only 282.6, which is much worse than the outside offer. This is a Mistake 4.\n*   Previous round offers:\n    * Player 1 offered me [5, 4, 0, 1, 0]. This is worth 5 * 26 + 4 * 100 + 0 * 18 + 1 * 66 + 0 * 9 = 130 + 400 + 0 + 66 + 0 = 596. Round 1 Discounted value = 596 * 1 = 596\n    * I offered Player 1 [0, 1, 2, 0, 3]. This means I would receive [5, 4, 0, 1, 0]. Worth 596 to me.\n* Considering a counteroffer: Let's aim for a value greater than the outside offer. I have a total value of 759. My goal is to receive an offer that is better than the discounted outside offer in the final round, which would require an offer valued at 657 / 0.81 \u2248 811.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that favors me more but still gives Player 1 something.  I will try giving Player 1 quantities of [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]. This leaves me with [5, 1, 2, 1, 3], with a value of 5*26 + 1*100 + 2*18 + 1*66 + 3*9 = 130 + 100 + 36 + 66 + 27 = 359. This is not good enough. I need to give away much less.\n\nLet's try giving Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would leave me with my total potential value of 759.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. My outside offer is much better. I will make a counteroffer that I think will secure me a better outcome.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since it's only the first round, I will make a counteroffer. I'll make a somewhat aggressive counteroffer, but one that still gives the other player a reasonable amount, hoping they will accept it in round 2.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 136.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 41, item 2 = 57, item 3 = 19, item 4 = 21, item 5 = 20.\n*   The total pool of items is: 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer now is worth more than accepting the same offer in the next round, since the value is multiplied by 0.9^(r-1), where r is the round number.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer is [1, 0, 1, 5, 1] to me. This means Player 1 gets:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 8 - 5 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    Therefore, my value for the current offer is:\n    (1 * 41) + (0 * 57) + (1 * 19) + (5 * 21) + (1 * 20) = 41 + 0 + 19 + 105 + 20 = 185\n\n*   This value (185) is greater than my outside offer (136).\n\n*   **Previous Round Offers:**\n    *   Player 1 offered me [0, 1, 1, 4, 1]. This would have given me:\n        *   Item 1: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n        *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n        *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n        *   Item 4: 8 - 4 = 4 units\n        *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n        Therefore, my value would have been:\n        (5 * 41) + (1 * 57) + (2 * 19) + (4 * 21) + (2 * 20) = 205 + 57 + 38 + 84 + 40 = 424\n\n    *   I countered with [2, 0, 1, 3, 1]. This would have given me:\n        *   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n        *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n        *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n        *   Item 4: 8 - 3 = 5 units\n        *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n        Therefore, my value would have been:\n        (3 * 41) + (2 * 57) + (2 * 19) + (5 * 21) + (2 * 20) = 123 + 114 + 38 + 105 + 40 = 420\n\n    *   The current offer is significantly worse than what I could have gotten in the previous round. However, since the previous round is over, there is nothing I can do about that now.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    *   Consider offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me everything:\n        *   Item 1: 5 units\n        *   Item 2: 2 units\n        *   Item 3: 3 units\n        *   Item 4: 8 units\n        *   Item 5: 3 units\n        My value = (5*41) + (2*57) + (3*19) + (8*21) + (3*20) = 205 + 114 + 57 + 168 + 60 = 604. Since this is better than accepting the current offer of 185 and greater than my outside option of 136, this seems good.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [1, 0, 1, 5, 1] gives me a value of 185, which is greater than my outside offer of 136.\n*   However, I could potentially get more value by making a counteroffer. Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] seems like the best option.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since this is the final round, the discount factor has less impact, but slightly reduces the value of negotiation outcomes from earlier rounds, usually favoring a resolution.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]):** This means I get nothing, so my total value from accepting is 0. This is clearly worse than my outside offer of 493.\n   \n   - **Considering potential counteroffers:** Since it's the last round, making a counteroffer that ensures my value is significantly over 493 without leaving an opportunity for a better counter by Player 2 would be beneficial.\n     \n     Let's calculate potential values to me after I've distributed items to Player 2:\n     - I could propose to give Player 2 a minimal share that ensures my value exceeds 493. For example:\n       - Offer [2, 1, 1, 6, 1] leaves me with [3, 1, 2, 2, 2].\n\n     Calculating the value to me:\n     - **3 units of item 1:** 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n     - **1 unit of item 2:** 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n     - **2 units of item 3:** 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n     - **2 units of item 4:** 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n     - **2 units of item 5:** 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n     - **Total value = 680**\n\n   This counteroffer gives me a value over my outside option (680 against 493), ensuring it is a better deal for me than walking away.\n\n3. **Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is not viable as it yields no value to me (this would be Mistake 4 as per the guidelines).\n   - Walking away would mean I get 493, but by offering a counteroffer that ensures more than 493, I can get a better result.\n   - As it's round 3, it\u2019s crucial to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value and avoids any missteps.\n\nGiven these analyses, I will proceed with a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 6, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1006. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, I will adjust this for a higher value.\n\n5) **Formulating a Counteroffer**:\n   - Consider reserving more high-value items like item 3 and item 4 for myself to increase the value.\n   - My counteroffer needs to optimize my units to exceed the discounted value of my outside offer.\n   - A potential counteroffer that might exceed my outside offer value:\n     - Offer [0, 1, 0, 2, 6] to Player 2.\n     - Values I keep:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 213\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 30\n       - 4 units of item 3 = 320\n       - 4 units of item 4 = 300\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n       - Total Value = 863 before discount\n   - Discounted Value = 863 \u00d7 0.9 = 776.7, which is still less than my outside offer. Adjust again.\n\n   I realize I need to keep more units from these categories such that my value exceeds the outside offer (1006 pre-discount age or effectively ~1117 after-r1 adjustment by gamma).\n\n   Let's offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 6] to Player 2:\n   - My units are then:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 142\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 40\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 240\n     - 5 units of item 4 = 375\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n     - Total Value = 797 before discount\n     - Discounted Value (for counteroffer) = 797 \u00d7 0.9 = slightly less but in a refined offer can hit my target.\n\nMy calculated offers under discounting still less, hence I'll need to decrease priority-share to meet/exceed negotiation gain potential.\n\nThus, I should reconsider achieving a viable balance by prioritizing holds on critical resource numbers, uplifting pre offers to surpass 1006 within r2-val.\n\n**Action**: {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1001. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 762 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

I must correct this and retain more of item 5 or adjust for greater value:\n\nLet's revise the counteroffer: [0, 0, 5, 1, 2] (keeping: [1, 1, 2, 2, 5])\n\nThis gives me:\n   - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n   - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n   - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n   - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n   - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 95 = 475\n   - Total value = 63 + 5 + 68 + 60 + 475 = 671\n\nThis new total value (671) is better than the outside offer, making this a suitable counteroffer that is beneficial based on my valuations.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 5, 1, 2]}",

This means offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 0, 5, 1, 2]. This means Player 1 keeps 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept: (0 * 57) + (0 * 31) + (5 * 15) + (1 * 57) + (2 * 23) = 0 + 0 + 75 + 57 + 46 = 178\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (178) is much lower than my outside offer (418).\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that is greater than 418 to be worthwhile. Let's aim for something that gives me significantly more value, while still leaving Player 1 with something. It's round 1, so there's room for negotiation.\n\nLet's start with a counteroffer where I take almost everything and leave Player 1 with relatively little. I need to offer Player 1 [x1,x2,x3,x4,x5]\n\nI will offer the Player 1, 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\nThis leaves me with 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\nMy value is therefore (1*57) + (1*31) + (5*15) + (2*57) + (5*23) = 57 + 31 + 75 + 114 + 115 = 392. Since 392 < 418 I must do better than that.\n\nHow about I keep item 4.\n\nIf I offer the Player 1, 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\nThis leaves me with 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\nMy value is therefore (1*57) + (1*31) + (4*15) + (0*57) + (4*23) = 57 + 31 + 60 + 0 + 92 = 240. This is awful!\n\nIt appears that Item 1 and Item 4 are the most important to me. The Player 1 is offering very little and wants a lot. Since it is round 1, I can go aggressive.\n\nLet's offer Player 1 0 items and take everything. Offer Player 1 [0,0,0,0,0]\nThis means I get everything. My value is (1*57) + (1*31) + (7*15) + (3*57) + (7*23) = 57+31+105+171+161 = 525\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is much worse than my outside offer, and it's only the first round, I will make a counteroffer aiming for a much better deal.

To improve this, let's adjust and aim closer to achieving a value over 638.\n\n   A better counteroffer might be giving Player 2 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5:\n   - I keep:\n     - Item 1: 1 (value = 63)\n     - Item 2: 1 (value = 5)\n     - Item 3: 4 (value = 136)\n     - Item 4: 2 (value = 60)\n     - Item 5: 5 (value = 475)\n   - Total retained value = 63 + 5 + 136 + 60 + 475 = 739\n\n3) **Make a decision based on analysis:**\n   - The counteroffer where I offer [0, 0, 3, 1, 2] gives me a value of 739, which is above 638, my outside option. \n   - Therefore, I should propose this counteroffer to ensure I receive a better deal than my outside offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will proceed with this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 418\n*   My item values: item 1 = 57, item 2 = 31, item 3 = 15, item 4 = 57, item 5 = 23\n*   Total items: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor to the power of (r-1) is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 3, 1, 2].  This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 57) + (0 * 31) + (3 * 15) + (1 * 57) + (2 * 23) = 0 + 0 + 45 + 57 + 46 = 148.\n    *   Discounted value of accepting current offer: 148 * 0.9 = 133.2\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer's discounted value (133.2) is significantly less than my outside offer (418). Accepting would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I want to keep as much of the valuable items (1 and 4) as possible. Since this is round 2, I need to think carefully.\n    * Calculate the total value of all items.\n        (1 * 57) + (1 * 31) + (7 * 15) + (3 * 57) + (7 * 23) = 57 + 31 + 105 + 171 + 161 = 525.\n\n    * Consider keeping all items. Then offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    * This would give me a value of 525. Discounted value: 525 * 0.9 = 472.5.\n    * This outcome (472.5) is greater than my outside option (418).\n\n    * Other possible offers:\n        * Offer the player the minimum required to get them to accept. This is difficult to calculate and risks a walk.\n        * Offer an equal split.\n        * Since I am in round 2, an aggressive play is to offer Player 1 almost nothing.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible (133.2 << 418). I won't accept it.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that is favorable to myself but not a complete take-all, which is to offer the other player close to nothing.\nOffering Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nThis will leave me with:\n* 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 57 = 57\n* 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 31 = 31\n* 6 units of item 3: 6 * 15 = 90\n* 3 units of item 4: 3 * 57 = 171\n* 6 units of item 5: 6 * 23 = 138\nTotal value: 57 + 31 + 90 + 171 + 138 = 487\nDiscounted value: 487 * 0.9 = 438.3\n\nThis offer is better than my outside option of 418.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

I'll aim to avoid mistakes 2 and 3 by ensuring the offer I make is worth more than my outside offer and involves a logical distribution of items rather than offering too much or too little.\n\n   - Let's calculate different potential offers while ensuring my retained value is greater than 254.\n\nPotential division: I'll aim to keep items that provide high value to me.\n\n   Suppose I offer Player 2:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 0 units of item 2\n   - 2 units of item 3\n   - 1 units of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n\n   My retained units would be:\n   - Item 1: 2 units (value = 2 * 63 = 126)\n   - Item 2: 1 unit (value = 1 * 95 = 95)\n   - Item 3: 3 units (value = 3 * 88 = 264)\n   - Item 4: 3 units (value = 3 * 25 = 75)\n   - Item 5: 1 unit (value = 1 * 13 = 13)\n\n   Total retained value = 126 + 95 + 264 + 75 + 13 = 573\n\nGiven this retained value is greater than my outside offer of 254, this offer is viable.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 205\n*   **Values of the items involved:** Item 1: 91, Item 2: 29, Item 3: 19, Item 4: 71, Item 5: 72\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of the same offer in the current round. This incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]. This means:\n    *   0 units of item 1 = 0 * 91 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 2 = 0 * 29 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 3 = 2 * 19 = 38\n    *   1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 71 = 71\n    *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 72 = 72\n    *   Total value of current offer = 0 + 0 + 38 + 71 + 72 = 181\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (181) is less than my outside offer (205). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that would give me a value greater than 205. I need to keep more valuable items for myself. Let's consider a counteroffer that gives the other player only item 3.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Offer [0, 0, 5, 0, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep:\n        *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 91 = 182\n        *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 29 = 29\n        *   0 units of item 3 = 0 * 19 = 0\n        *   4 units of item 4 = 4 * 71 = 284\n        *   2 units of item 5 = 2 * 72 = 144\n        *   Total value = 182 + 29 + 0 + 284 + 144 = 639\n\n        This is significantly better than my outside option.\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** Offer [1, 0, 5, 0, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep:\n        *   1 units of item 1 = 1 * 91 = 91\n        *   1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 29 = 29\n        *   0 units of item 3 = 0 * 19 = 0\n        *   4 units of item 4 = 4 * 71 = 284\n        *   2 units of item 5 = 2 * 72 = 144\n        *   Total value = 91 + 29 + 0 + 284 + 144 = 548\n\n        This is significantly better than my outside option.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it. I also don't want to walk away as there might be room to negotiate a better deal. Thus, I should make a counteroffer.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer where I keep most of the valuable items.

                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, I'll analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 777.\n   - The values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 20\n     - Item 2: 97\n     - Item 3: 94\n     - Item 4: 21\n     - Item 5: 1\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. In future rounds, any accepted offer's value will be decreased due to the multiplication by 0.9^(r-1), where r is the round number.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer.\n   - To evaluate potential counteroffers, I must ensure the total value of keeping items exceeds 777 after considering the discount.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\nSince there is no current offer, I'll propose an initial offer to Player 2, keeping the division beneficial compared to my outside offer. I'll aim to keep a high value for myself while allowing earnest negotiation. The strategy here is to keep more of the higher value items (especially items 2 and 3) since they significantly contribute to the total value.\n\nCalculate my ideal kept quantity first:\n\n- Plan to keep most of items 2 and 3, possibly item 4 due to moderate value, while offering more of items 1 and 5 with lower values.\n\nHere\u2019s a potential division:\n\n- Offer: [1, 1, 1, 3, 3] (giving 1 unit of items 1, 2, and 3, and more of lower-valued items 4 and 5 to Player 2)\n- Calculate value of keeping: [0, 4, 3, 1, 2]\n  - Item 1: 0 units x 20 = 0\n  - Item 2: 4 units x 97 = 388\n  - Item 3: 3 units x 94 = 282\n  - Item 4: 1 unit x 21 = 21\n  - Item 5: 2 units x 1 = 2\n  - Total value = 693\n\nThis proposed division provides me with a total value of 693, which is below my outside offer of 777. To avoid mistake 2, I need to increase this value above my outside offer.\n\nTo surpass 777:\n\nAdjust offer and recalculate:\n\n- Offer: [1, 1, 1, 3, 2] (similar plan, slight adjustment)\n- Calculate value of my portion: [0, 4, 3, 1, 3]\n  - Item 1: 0 units x 20 = 0\n  - Item 2: 4 units x 97 = 388\n  - Item 3: 3 units x 94 = 282\n  - Item 4: 1 unit x 21 = 21\n  - Item 5: 3 units x 1 = 3\n  - Total value = 694\n\nThis offer still doesn't reach the 777 value. I must revise again:\n\nReformulating requires:\n\n- Offer: [1, 0, 1, 3, 2] (give even less of crucial item 2)\n- Calculate value of my portion: [0, 5, 3, 1, 3]\n  - Item 1: 0 units x 20 = 0\n  - Item 2: 5 units x 97 = 485\n  - Item 3: 3 units x 94 = 282\n  - Item 4: 1 unit x 21 = 21\n  - Item 5: 3 units x 1 = 3\n  - Total value = 791\n\nFinally, this revised action yields 791, which is above 777.\n\nTherefore, I propose this counteroffer to Player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 635. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 927 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Let's calculate its value to me:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 50 = 50\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 20 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 85 = 85\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 100 = 300\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 54 = 108\n    *   Total value: 50 + 0 + 85 + 300 + 108 = 543\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 543, which is less than my outside offer of 635.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider making a counteroffer that is better than 635 for me. This means Player 1 needs to receive less valuable items, or fewer units overall.

Given it's Round 1, there is no immediate penalty for waiting for a better offer.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2.\n   - My task is to create an initial offer considering that the value of what I keep should ideally exceed my outside offer (794).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I must ensure that the value of the items I keep is greater than 794.\n   - Hence, my counteroffer should focus on retaining high-value items for myself.\n\nLet's attempt to create a counteroffer:\n- Assume I want to reach a value greater than 794. A potential initial guess is:\n  - I will keep all of item 1, which is worth 65 to me.\n  - I will propose to give Player 2 3 units of item 2, keep 1 for myself (1 unit \u00d7 56 = 56).\n  - I will propose to give Player 2 all 4 units of item 3, worth relatively little to me (4 units \u00d7 13 = 52).\n  - I will propose to give Player 2 2 units of item 4, keep 2 for myself (2 units \u00d7 62 = 124).\n  - I will propose to give Player 2 4 units of item 5, keep 6 for myself (6 units \u00d7 56 = 336).\n\nCalculating the total retained value for myself:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n  - Item 5: 6 \u00d7 56 = 336\n  - Total: 65 + 56 + 0 + 124 + 336 = 581\n\nThe total value of 581 is less than 794, so I need to adjust my offer. Let's modify it to solidify the value above 794.\n\nLet's adjust by keeping more of item 2 (as it's highly valued):\n\n- Assume, now: \n  - All of item 1 (65)\n  - All of item 2 (224)\n  - 0 of item 3 (0)\n  - 2 of item 4 (124)\n  - 6 of item 5 (336)\n\nNew total retained value:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n  - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 56 = 224\n  - Item 3: 0\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n  - Item 5: 6 \u00d7 56 = 336\n  - Total: 65 + 224 + 0 + 124 + 336 = 749\n\nThis retains lower than 794. Let's refine further to exceed this safeguard. \n\n- The appropriate decision at this stage is to strengthen by taking more of the high-value unit:\n\n- Redesign offer keeping more units from item 4 while adjusting item 2:\n  - Assume:\n    - All of item 1 (65)\n    - 3 of item 2 (168)\n    - 0 of item 3 (0)\n    - 3 of item 4 (186)\n    - 7 of item 5 (392)\n\nRecoaching:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n  - Item 3: 0\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n  - Item 5: 7 \u00d7 56 = 392\n  - Total: 65 + 168 + 0 + 186 + 392 = 811\n\nThis proposed retention exceeds my outside offer of 794, providing a strong counteroffer.

This means Player 1 gets:\n    *   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 4 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 10 - 3 = 7\n    My Value from the current offer: (0 * 58) + (1 * 27) + (4 * 29) + (1 * 18) + (3 * 83) = 0 + 27 + 116 + 18 + 249 = 410.\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** 410 < 1072.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1072. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 645 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1072\n   - My values per item: item 1: 58, item 2: 27, item 3: 29, item 4: 18, item 5: 83\n   - Total items: item 1: 1, item 2: 4, item 3: 4, item 4: 4, item 5: 10\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** [0, 0, 4, 0, 1] (What I *receive*)\n      - Item 1: 1 * 58 = 58\n      - Item 2: 4 * 27 = 108\n      - Item 3: 0 * 29 = 0\n      - Item 4: 4 * 18 = 72\n      - Item 5: 9 * 83 = 747\n      - Total value: 58 + 108 + 0 + 72 + 747 = 985\n\n   - Current offer value (985) * discount factor (0.9) = 886.5\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 886.5 < 1072, so accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**  I want to find an offer that is better than my outside offer after applying the discount factor. So I need an offer that yields me a value of at least 1072 / 0.9 = 1191.11. Let's see if giving Player 1 nothing of item 1, 1 of item 2, all item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5 will yield a value for me greater than 1191.11. In this case, what I get is the following:\n       - Item 1: 1 * 58 = 58\n       - Item 2: 3 * 27 = 81\n       - Item 3: 0 * 29 = 0\n       - Item 4: 3 * 18 = 54\n       - Item 5: 9 * 83 = 747\n       - Total value: 58 + 81 + 0 + 54 + 747 = 940\n       - This is lower than both my outside offer and the minimum required for it to be acceptable after discounting.\n\n   - I think the key is item 5, which I value the most. I have 10 units of item 5 to divide. I should offer Player 1 fewer units of Item 5 in my counteroffer.\n   - How about giving Player 1 [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]? What I keep is [1, 3, 1, 3, 10]. The value to me of that distribution would be: 1 * 58 + 3 * 27 + 1 * 29 + 3 * 18 + 10 * 83 = 58 + 81 + 29 + 54 + 830 = 1052.\n   - Discounted value is 1052 * 0.9 = 946.8 which is still less than my outside offer.\n   - How about giving Player 1 [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]? What I keep is [1, 3, 1, 3, 9]. The value to me of that distribution would be: 1 * 58 + 3 * 27 + 1 * 29 + 3 * 18 + 9 * 83 = 58 + 81 + 29 + 54 + 747 = 969.\n   - Discounted value is 969 * 0.9 = 872.1 which is still less than my outside offer.\n   - How about giving Player 1 [0, 1, 3, 1, 2]? What I keep is [1, 3, 1, 3, 8]. The value to me of that distribution would be: 1 * 58 + 3 * 27 + 1 * 29 + 3 * 18 + 8 * 83 = 58 + 81 + 29 + 54 + 664 = 886.\n   - Discounted value is 886 * 0.9 = 797.4 which is still less than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, and I haven't found a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer (considering the discount factor), I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 165\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 66, Item 2: 49, Item 3: 7, Item 4: 8, Item 5: 25\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 0, 2, 0, 2]. This means I get:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 66 = 198\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 49 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 7 = 14\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 8 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 25 = 50\n    *   Total value: 198 + 0 + 14 + 0 + 50 = 262\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** 262 > 165. Accepting the current offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Before deciding whether to accept, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I need to keep in mind the quantities available. Player 1 is asking for [3,0,2,0,2]. This means I get [1,5,1,3,1]. This gives me a value of 1*66 + 5*49 + 1*7 + 3*8 + 1*25 = 66+245+7+24+25 = 367. They have 66+98+14+0+50=228.\n\nIf I offer [1,2,0,0,0], I would receive [3,3,3,3,3], which is a value of 3*66+3*49+3*7+3*8+3*25 = 198+147+21+24+75 = 465.  Player 1 would get 66+98+0+0+0 = 164. I believe I can get more from the other player than the current amount.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of 262 is better than my outside offer of 165. However, the current offer from me to them is 164. So that will need to improve. Let me offer them the following.\nI will offer [2,1,1,1,1]. This gives me [2,4,2,2,2] resulting in a total of 2*66+4*49+2*7+2*8+2*25 = 132 + 196 + 14 + 16 + 50 = 408. Player 1 would then get 132+49+7+8+25 = 221. This is significantly better than my outside offer, but I think Player 1 will want more.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 the following [2,2,1,1,1]. That means I receive [2,3,2,2,2]. 2*66+3*49+2*7+2*8+2*25 = 132+147+14+16+50=359. Their total would be 132+98+7+8+25 = 270.\n\nLet me consider offering Player 1 the following [3,1,1,1,1]. That means I receive [1,4,2,2,2]. 66+196+14+16+50=342. Their total would be 198+49+7+8+25 = 287.\n\nI am going to start with my offer of [2,1,1,1,1] and see if I can get them to bite.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means accepting later is worth less than accepting now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 2, 4, 3, 1]. This means they are offering me 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.  My value for this offer is:\n      (2 * 20) + (2 * 88) + (4 * 34) + (3 * 11) + (1 * 20) = 40 + 176 + 136 + 33 + 20 = 405\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:**  405 > 265.  Accepting this offer is better than walking away right now.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**  Consider a counteroffer. Player 1 is offering me a good amount so let's look at options close to that:\n      * If I offer [3, 4, 4, 2, 1] to player 1, that means I keep: [2, 2, 4, 3, 1].  My value is (2 * 20) + (2 * 88) + (4 * 34) + (3 * 11) + (1 * 20) = 405\n      * If I offer [3, 3, 4, 2, 1] to player 1, that means I keep: [2, 3, 4, 3, 1].  My value is (2 * 20) + (3 * 88) + (4 * 34) + (3 * 11) + (1 * 20) = 40 + 264 + 136 + 33 + 20 = 493\n      * If I offer [3, 3, 4, 3, 1] to player 1, that means I keep: [2, 3, 4, 2, 1].  My value is (2 * 20) + (3 * 88) + (4 * 34) + (2 * 11) + (1 * 20) = 40 + 264 + 136 + 22 + 20 = 482\n      These values are significantly better than the outside offer, and even slightly better than the 405 value of the current offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is better than my outside option, so I shouldn't walk away.\n   - The current offer value of 405 is a good starting point.\n   - By offering a counteroffer like [3, 3, 4, 2, 1], which I value at 493, I am asking for a slightly better deal. With the discount factor in mind, this will benefit me more in round 2 if it is closer to final acceptance.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 4, 2, 1]}\n```",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

One possible division is to offer 2 units of items 1, 2, 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5, keeping the rest for myself. Let's calculate that:\n     - Keeping 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n     - Keeping 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n     - Keeping 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n     - Keeping 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n     - Keeping 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n     - Total kept value = 713\n\n   - My total value of 713 is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 306, making it an attractive option.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - Since there is no existing offer to accept and walking would mean accepting the significantly lower outside offer, I am better off making a counteroffer that ensures a value higher than my fallback. \n\nGiven these calculations and considerations, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Here's the calculation for a speculative, favorable division for me:\n     Let's say I propose that Player 2 receives: \n     - 1 unit of item 1 \n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3 \n     - 1 unit of item 4 \n     - 0 units of item 5 \n   \n   This leaves me receiving:\n   - 2 units of item 1 (2 \u00d7 8 = 16)\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (1 \u00d7 38 = 38)\n   - 3 units of item 3 (3 \u00d7 71 = 213)\n   - 2 units of item 4 (2 \u00d7 4 = 8)\n   - 1 unit of item 5 (1 \u00d7 15 = 15)\n\n   Total value to me: 16 + 38 + 213 + 8 + 15 = 290.\n\n   This value is comfortably above my outside offer of 139, even if applying some negotiation flexibility for adjustments if Player 2 makes a counter counter-offer later.\n   \n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - There is no existing offer to accept.\n   - Walking away prematurely is not the best course when I can propose an advantageous counteroffer.\n   - Propose a counteroffer that gives me significantly more value, but leaves room for Player 2 to think their share is acceptable.\n\nWith this in mind, I will propose the following as a COUNTEROFFER:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0].\n    *   Value to me: (1 * 79) + (1 * 49) + (1 * 11) + (1 * 41) + (0 * 57) = 79 + 49 + 11 + 41 + 0 = 180.\n    *   Comparison to outside offer: 180 < 288. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would offer to Player 1. I need to keep enough to exceed my outside offer value of 288.\n\nLet's consider a scenario where I offer Player 1 just enough to potentially make them accept. This requires some estimation of their values, which I don't have. For now, let's try offering them more to see what I'd be left with.\n\nIf I kept everything, I would have: (3 * 79) + (2 * 49) + (4 * 11) + (3 * 41) + (1 * 57) = 237 + 98 + 44 + 123 + 57 = 559\n\nTo exceed my outside offer of 288, I would need to offer them a combination of items that leaves me with at least 288 value.\n\nLet's start by thinking about what it would take to leave me indifferent. I could try offering them something that is relatively lower value to me compared to player 1, like item 3. But my value is 11, so I would have to offer a substantial portion of another item.\n\nI can't be sure what player 1 values each item, so I have to consider the range of potential offers.\n\nConsider a counteroffer where I offer slightly less than half of everything. Since round 1 is valuable due to the discount factor, I want to try to make a deal.\n\nLet's consider offering: [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]\nMy remaining items: [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]\nValue of my remaining items: (2 * 79) + (1 * 49) + (2 * 11) + (2 * 41) + (1 * 57) = 158 + 49 + 22 + 82 + 57 = 368. 368 > 288\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

I'll start by keeping the valuable items for myself (Item 3) and then calculate how many of the other items I need to keep. I have to give the player something so I don't commit mistake 3, offering all items. Let's try to give the opponent 1 of each item. I'll calculate how much value I must retain:\n\n    Offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to the opponent\n    I retain:\n    Item 1: 3 units * 64 = 192\n    Item 2: 3 units * 60 = 180\n    Item 3: 1 units * 90 = 90\n    Item 4: 2 units * 30 = 60\n    Item 5: 6 units * 36 = 216\n\n    Total = 738 > 722\n\n    This looks like a better deal than the current offer and better than walking away\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is bad, and I have an outside offer.

Choose a division such that the total value I expect is higher than 229.\n\n   Example of a possible counteroffer: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n   My value if I retain [2, 3, 1, 2, 5]:\n   - (2 * 20) + (3 * 37) + (1 * 18) + (2 * 36) + (5 * 100) = 40 + 111 + 18 + 72 + 500 = 741\n\n   Giving Player 2 [2, 1, 1, 1, 2], my value remains high:\n   - (2 * 37) + (1 * 36) + (2 * 100) = 74 + 18 + 200 = 292 (<-- much less than the value retained)\n\n   This counteroffer leaves me with a value of 741, which is a significant increase above my outside offer.\n\n3) Decision:\n- The current offer is less than my outside offer value, so accepting it is equivalent to mistake 4.\n- Walking away would force me into mistake 5 only if my counteroffer ends up being better than Player 2 would accept.\n- A counteroffer with [2, 1, 1, 1, 2] is above the outside value and way above what current division brings. \n\nThus, my action will be to propose a counteroffer that attempts to retain a majority of the high-value item 5, without giving away items that cumulatively surpass my fallback potential. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 722\n*   My item values: item 1: 64, item 2: 60, item 3: 90, item 4: 30, item 5: 36\n*   Total pool of items: item 1: 4, item 2: 4, item 3: 2, item 4: 3, item 5: 7\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of its value in round 2.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   item 1: 2 units.  Value: 2 * 64 = 128\n    *   item 2: 3 units. Value: 3 * 60 = 180\n    *   item 3: 1 unit.  Value: 1 * 90 = 90\n    *   item 4: 2 units. Value: 2 * 30 = 60\n    *   item 5: 5 units. Value: 5 * 36 = 180\n    *   Total value: 128 + 180 + 90 + 60 + 180 = 638\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (638) is less than my outside offer value (722).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I could offer that Player 1 might accept, but that would still be better than my outside offer. Since this is round 2, and there's only one round left, I need to make an attractive offer to Player 1. Let's consider a few options:\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1 (leaning towards Player 1):** [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] means I would be giving 1 item 1 to player 1, so the amount I would be receiving is [3,4,2,3,7]. Value: (3 * 64) + (4 * 60) + (2 * 90) + (3 * 30) + (7 * 36) = 192 + 240 + 180 + 90 + 252 = 954\n    *   **Counteroffer 2 (slightly better for me):** [2, 1, 0, 0, 1] means I would be receiving [2, 3, 2, 3, 6]. Value: (2 * 64) + (3 * 60) + (2 * 90) + (3 * 30) + (6 * 36) = 128 + 180 + 180 + 90 + 216 = 794\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3 (similar to player 1s offer):** [2, 2, 1, 1, 2] means I would be receiving [2, 2, 1, 2, 5]. Value: (2 * 64) + (2 * 60) + (1 * 90) + (2 * 30) + (5 * 36) = 128 + 120 + 90 + 60 + 180 = 578\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   Counteroffer 3 is not going to cut it, so I need to figure out which counter offer will be best. We also need to consider that it is the second round, so accepting something good is more important since the discount factor may come into play on the third round. \n*   The outside offer has a value of 722. Therefore I am between counteroffer 1 which has a value of 954 and counteroffer 2 which has a value of 794.\n\n**Final Decision:** Counteroffer 1 gives me more value so I will choose it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer (to me):** [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value would be (1 * 64) + (1 * 60) + (0 * 90) + (0 * 30) + (0 * 36) = 124. Applying the discount factor, the present value is 124 * 0.81 = 100.44.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get if I accept the current offer versus walking away versus making a counteroffer. Let's consider a counteroffer where I try to maximize my value. I currently have:\n    * Items for me if I accept: 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 0 item 3, 0 item 4, 0 item 5\n    * Items for Player 1 if I accept: 3 item 1, 3 item 2, 2 item 3, 3 item 4, 7 item 5\n    Since this is the last round, if I make a counteroffer, it's effectively a WALK. So, I just need to compare accepting the offer vs. walking away.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 100.44. My outside offer is 722.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 100.44, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 722.\n*   Making a counteroffer in this final round is equivalent to walking away.\n*   Therefore, I should walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I receive 1 unit of each item.\n    My value for this offer is (1 * 25) + (1 * 55) + (1 * 32) + (1 * 86) + (1 * 38) = 236.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (236) is less than my outside offer (526).\n\nNow, consider a potential counteroffer. My goal is to get a deal worth more than 526 to me. Since it is round 1, there is still time to make a counteroffer that gives me a high payoff. I will calculate a counteroffer that gives Player 1 just enough to potentially exceed their outside offer. I don't know their values, but I can try and make a reasonable offer that favors me. I'll offer Player 1 a decent portion of the less valuable items and keep the bulk of the more valuable items. Let's try offering Player 1 [2, 2, 2, 0, 3]. This means I keep 2 of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 2 of Item 4, and 3 of Item 5. My value for this outcome would be:\n(2 * 25) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 32) + (2 * 86) + (3 * 38) = 50 + 110 + 64 + 172 + 114 = 510\n\nThis potential counteroffer would still give me less value than my outside offer value, so I will adjust it slightly to try and exceed my outside offer.\nLet's try offering Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 0, 2].\nI would receive: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\nMy value would be: (3 * 25) + (3 * 55) + (3 * 32) + (2 * 86) + (4 * 38) = 75 + 165 + 96 + 172 + 152 = 660.\n\nThis value (660) exceeds my outside offer value (526).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable.\n*   Walking away is not ideal since I can potentially get a better deal.\n*   Therefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This influences future rounds as the present value of the deal decreases with each passing round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n- Since there is no current offer, I'll consider possible counteroffers:\n  - **Retain items with the highest value** and see if it surpasses the outside offer.\n  - My aim is to ensure that my retained value remains higher than 404.\n\n**Potential Retention Based on Value:**\n- Keep 3 units of item 2 (82 \u00d7 2 = 164)\n- Keep 3 units of item 1 (59 \u00d7 3 = 177)\n- Keep 2 units of item 3 (54 \u00d7 2 = 108)\n- Results in a retained total of 449 if I propose giving away 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5.\n\nCalculation if I propose offering: [0, 0, 1, 0, 3]\n- Item 1: 0 units offered, 3 retained = 59 \u00d7 3 = 177\n- Item 2: 0 units offered, 2 retained = 82 \u00d7 2 = 164\n- Item 3: 1 unit offered, 2 retained = 54 \u00d7 2 = 108\n- Item 5: 3 units offered, 0 retained = 40 \u00d7 0 = 0\n\nRetained value: 177 + 164 + 108 = 449\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n- **Compare to Outside Offer**: 449 (retained) is greater than my outside offer value of 404.\n- **Formulate an Offer**: Leave just enough flexibility to negotiate. Propose an initial moderate division by keeping the high value items and giving away lower valued items and additional units of items that maximize my retention value.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will make a counteroffer that increases my retained value significantly over my outside offer, while also being reasonable in sharing some of the total items.\n\n### Action\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 3]}",

Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I want to make an offer that gives me a value greater than 625. The total value of all items to me is (3 * 63) + (2 * 63) + (3 * 79) + (0 * 62) + (3 * 99) = 189 + 126 + 237 + 0 + 297 = 849. This is the total value of the items if I keep them all.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on an action, let's walk through the steps:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - My outside offer value is 1139.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 12\n     - Item 2: 86\n     - Item 3: 35\n     - Item 4: 95\n     - Item 5: 84\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 8 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, which affects rounds 2 and 3 more significantly, reducing the value as it prolongs.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - As there's no current offer to evaluate, I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a higher total value than my outside offer.\n\n   - To maximize my value, I should keep more of the higher-value items:\n     - My most valuable items are item 4 and item 2. \n\n   - A possible division that could maximize my value and still be potentially acceptable to the other player:\n   \n     - Offer to Player 2: [3, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n       - I would keep:\n         - Item 1: 5 units (5 \u00d7 12 = 60)\n         - Item 2: 3 units (3 \u00d7 86 = 258)\n         - Item 3: 2 units (2 \u00d7 35 = 70)\n         - Item 4: 3 units (3 \u00d7 95 = 285)\n         - Item 5: 5 units (5 \u00d7 84 = 420)\n       - Total value = 60 + 258 + 70 + 285 + 420 = 1093\n\n   - My proposed total value of 1093 is less than my outside offer value of 1139, showing it would currently be better to walk away based on this calculation.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\n   - The proposed value is less than my outside offer. Thus, making an offer that keeps more for me is not reasonable at this round.\n   - I need to consider offering fewer high-value items to Player 2 for a successful negotiation outcome.\n\nGiven this information and the constraints not to make mistakes, it's best to start significantly reducing what I offer while keeping more high-value items. Let\u2019s balance the offer for potential acceptance:\n\nCounteroffer: [3, 0, 2, 1, 2] \n\nNow let's calculate it:\n\n   - I keep:\n     - Item 1: 5 units (5 \u00d7 12 = 60)\n     - Item 2: 3 units (3 \u00d7 86 = 258)\n     - Item 3: 2 units (2 \u00d7 35 = 70)\n     - Item 4: 2 units (2 \u00d7 95 = 190)\n     - Item 5: 3 units (3 \u00d7 84 = 252)\n   - My total value = 60 + 258 + 70 + 190 + 252 = 830 \n\nThis counteroffer will not maximize my value relative to the outside offer, leading me to walk away:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This means if I walk away, I will receive a value of 566.\n\n2. **Values of the Items:**\n   - My private values per unit of each item are:\n     - Item 1: 89\n     - Item 2: 85\n     - Item 3: 73\n     - Item 4: 95\n     - Item 5: 82\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - 7 units of item 1\n   - 1 unit of item 2\n   - 4 units of item 3\n   - 2 units of item 4\n   - 2 units of item 5\n\n4. **Discount Factor Influence:**\n   - The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, means that in future rounds, the value I get from an offer will be multiplied by a discount factor. This means waiting could decrease my final value.\n\n### Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer (If any):**\n   - There is no current offer on the table, so I have to initiate an offer.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffers:**\n   - I need to carefully consider what to offer to maximize my value while ensuring it is more than my outside offer value.\n   - I should propose a division that gives me a total value greater than 566 (my outside offer).\n\n3. **Calculating a Potential Offer:**\n   - Let's explore a scenario where I offer Player 2 minimal units:\n     - Offer Player 2: [2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5]\n     - For me:\n       - Item 1: 5 units = 5 \u00d7 89 = 445\n       - Item 2: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 85 = 85\n       - Item 3: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n       - Item 4: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 95 = 190\n       - Item 5: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n     - Total value for me: 1103\n\nThis offer gives me a total value of 1103, much higher than my outside offer of 566, providing a strong basis to proceed with the negotiation without the risk of Mistake 2 or Mistake 5.\n\n### Decision\n\nBased on this analysis, proposing the above counteroffer would avoid leaving value on the table compared to my outside offer, making my proposal strategically sound.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Since it is round 2, there is only one round left. If I make a counteroffer and it is rejected, then I will WALK and receive 30. So a counteroffer is only worthwhile if it greatly increases my value.\n\nThe current offer is pretty good. I get 512.1. Let's consider a slightly more aggressive offer, perhaps offering Player 1 only the minimum to make it better than them walking away.\nPlayer 1's values are unknown to me.\n\nI'm going to ACCEPT the current offer.

I'll try a revised offer:\n\n- **Revised Counteroffer Proposal:**\n  - 0 units of Item 1\n  - 0 units of Item 2\n  - 1 unit of Item 3\n  - 4 units of Item 4\n  - 0 units of Item 5\n\n**Value Calculation for Me:**\n- Keeping 4 units of Item 1: 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n- Keeping 4 units of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 30 = 120\n- Keeping 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n- Keeping 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 15 = 60\n- Keeping 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n\nTotal value to me: 104 + 120 + 270 + 60 + 66 = 620.\nThis is still below 730. I need to make another revision:\n\n### Final Counteroffer:\n- **Counteroffer Proposal** where I update it, ensuring high-value items are prioritized.\n  \nLet\u2019s use another strategy:\n\n- **Refined Counteroffer Proposal:**\n  - 2 units of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 1 unit of Item 3\n  - 4 units of Item 4\n  - 0 units of Item 5\n\n**Value Calculation for Me:**\n- Keeping 2 units of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n- Keeping 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n- Keeping 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n- Keeping 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 15 = 60\n- Keeping 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n\nTotal value to me: 52 + 60 + 270 + 60 + 66 = 508.\n\n### Conclusion:\nEven this refined counteroffer still doesn't compare well relative to my outside offer. Based on this layout, it is strategic to adjust my counteroffer several times until the collected value tiered me above the 730. One must hit above the mark to make it acceptable compared to my outside option. Let's put forward something reachable in terms of reasonably likable to Player 2.\n\nMy final calculated decision is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n\nI will wait and be cautious not to make mistakes. Since no offer can meet or exceed the outside deal currently, if forced in the next future rounds, above can be modified.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 707.\n*   My values for items 1-5 are 59, 14, 10, 81, and 5, respectively.\n*   The total pool of items is 9 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value, and in round 3, it is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times the value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [4, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 9 - 4 = 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Total value = (5 * 59) + (1 * 14) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 81) + (3 * 5) = 295 + 14 + 20 + 162 + 15 = 506\n\n    *   The current offer gives me a value of 506. This is less than my outside offer of 707. So, accepting this offer would be a Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 707. The other player gets what I don't keep. Let's consider some possibilities.  I want to keep more of the valuable items 1 and 4.\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]** I give the other player 2 of item 1 and none of the others. I keep:\n        *   Item 1: 9 - 2 = 7\n        *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   Item 5: 4 - 0 = 4\n        *   Total Value = (7*59) + (2*14) + (2*10) + (2*81) + (4*5) = 413 + 28 + 20 + 162 + 20 = 643.  Not good enough, still less than 707.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]** I give the other player 1 of item 1 and none of the others. I keep:\n        *   Item 1: 9 - 1 = 8\n        *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   Item 5: 4 - 0 = 4\n        *   Total Value = (8*59) + (2*14) + (2*10) + (2*81) + (4*5) = 472 + 28 + 20 + 162 + 20 = 702.  Still less than 707.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]** I give the other player none of the items, and keep all of them. \n        *   Total Value = (9*59) + (2*14) + (2*10) + (2*81) + (4*5) = 531 + 28 + 20 + 162 + 20 = 761. I should counteroffer, but this counteroffer might be rejected.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. Offering [0,0,0,0,0] may lead to a rejection of the offer. The discounted value of the offer from player 1, if accepted in the next round would have to be > 707/0.9= 785.55.\n\nLet's also consider offering them only item 5 since it has the lowest value for me. Offering [0,0,0,0,4] I keep items [9, 2, 2, 2, 0] which gives me a total value of 531 + 28 + 20 + 162 + 0 = 741. This is greater than my outside offer, so this seems a good counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 707. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 507 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 707.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1: 59, item 2: 14, item 3: 10, item 4: 81, item 5: 5.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1: 9, item 2: 2, item 3: 2, item 4: 2, item 5: 4.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [5, 1, 0, 1, 2] (This is what I *receive*).\n    *   Value of current offer: (5 * 59) + (1 * 14) + (0 * 10) + (1 * 81) + (2 * 5) = 295 + 14 + 0 + 81 + 10 = 400\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 400 * 0.9 = 360\n\n*   Since the current offer is worth 360 * 0.9 = 360 to me, which is less than my outside offer of 707, accepting is not ideal.\n\n*   Consider offering Player 1 everything I can in the previous round (Round 1), to see if it will give me better returns.\n*   Since the negotiation will end after round 3, I will walk away if I don't get a deal in round 3.\n\n*   What items do I have if Player 1 is being offered [5, 1, 0, 1, 2]?\n    *   Item 1: 9 - 5 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   The total value is: (4 * 59) + (1 * 14) + (2 * 10) + (1 * 81) + (2 * 5) = 236 + 14 + 20 + 81 + 10 = 361\n    *   The discounted value is 361 * 0.9 = 324.9\n\n*   **Let's test some potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that yields a value greater than my outside option after discounting. My outside option has value 707. With the discount factor, this means I want a final undiscounted value of at least 707/0.9 \u2248 785.56. That's what my holdings should be worth if I accept.\n\n*   Consider that Player 1 offered me [5, 1, 0, 1, 2]. I currently have [4, 1, 2, 1, 2] remaining if I accept this offer.\n*   How about a split of [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]?\n    *   I would get [6, 2, 2, 2, 4]. This is: (6 * 59) + (2 * 14) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 81) + (4 * 5) = 354 + 28 + 20 + 162 + 20 = 584, which is less than 785.56.\n\n*   How about offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? Then I keep everything.\n    *   I get [9, 2, 2, 2, 4]. This is: (9 * 59) + (2 * 14) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 81) + (4 * 5) = 531 + 28 + 20 + 162 + 20 = 761. Discounted, it would only be 684.9.\n*   Since I want a value higher than 785.56 and that is not achievable even with taking everything, let's consider what the other player would want.\n\n*   It seems the only items I can actually increase the value of significantly are items 1 and 4.\n    *   Let's consider what I can offer to Player 1 if I took almost everything but a small portion of items 1 and 4.\n\n*   Let's try to get a value close to 785.56.\n    *   If I offer [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I get [7, 2, 2, 2, 4] and it is worth: (7 * 59) + (2 * 14) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 81) + (4 * 5) = 413 + 28 + 20 + 162 + 20 = 643. Discounted it becomes 578.7.\n*   Let's try a really extreme offer to player 1 of [8, 2, 2, 2, 4]. Then I get [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] and it is worth 59, discounted 53.1.\n*   Since I am not able to get above 785.56, it is best to WALK in the last round.\n\n*   Since I am in round 2, I can WALK or COUNTEROFFER. I will make a counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer. It will be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This means that accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [3, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means Player 1 keeps:\n      - Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n      - Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n      - Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n      - Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n      - Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n   - My value for this offer is:\n      - 3 * 14 + 1 * 57 + 1 * 8 + 0 * 53 + 1 * 21 = 42 + 57 + 8 + 0 + 21 = 128\n   - This value of 128 is LESS than my outside option of 138. Therefore, accepting would be Mistake 4.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me more value than 138. Since it's round 1, I should aim for a higher value, considering the discount factor.\n   - If I keep all the items, my value is 474.\n   - Let's consider giving Player 1 a minimal amount to see how it affects my value. For example, offering [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\n        - I would keep: [4, 4, 3, 1, 2]\n        - My value would be: 4 * 14 + 4 * 57 + 3 * 8 + 1 * 53 + 2 * 21 = 56 + 228 + 24 + 53 + 42 = 403\n   - I need to give a more substantial offer than that. I'll try offering them [2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n      - I would keep: [3, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n      - My value: 3 * 14 + 3 * 57 + 2 * 8 + 1 * 53 + 1 * 21 = 42 + 171 + 16 + 53 + 21 = 303\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away would give me 138.\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that is good for me.\n   - Let's offer Player 1 [2, 2, 1, 0, 1].

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 519. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 1, 0, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my next action, let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 519.\n   - My private values for the items are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 77\n     - Item 2: 13\n     - Item 3: 64\n     - Item 4: 39\n     - Item 5: 36\n   - The total pool of items consists of 2 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 9 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor of 0.9 means the value of future rounds is reduced by this factor each round, making it relevant to consider in comparing offers now versus later.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 2, 0, 0, 4]\n     - Value of receiving 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n     - Value of receiving 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n     - Total value of current offer: 26 + 144 = 170\n     - Applying the discount factor (0.9 as this is round 2): 170 \u00d7 0.9 = 153\n     - This value of 153 is below my outside offer of 519.\n   - Evaluate other potential counteroffers. One strategy is to ensure I receive more value than my outside offer:\n     - Example counteroffer [1, 5, 3, 1, 5] (giving away [1, 2, 0, 0, 4], which I formally offered in round 1):\n       - Value I receive:\n         - 1 unit of item 1: 77\n         - 2 units of item 2: 26 (7-5 kept)\n         - 3 units of item 3: 192\n         - 1 unit of item 4: 39\n         - 5 units of item 5: 180\n       - Total value: 77 + 26 + 192 + 39 + 180 = 514 (lower than my outside offer)\n     - Since 514 < 519, this offer is not better for me.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer does not meet the minimum value of my outside offer (153 < 519).\n   - All offers analyzed still result in a value below my outside offer value (and thus also after discount consideration).\n   - To maximize my value, I should aim for a counteroffer that gives me a total value exceeding 519 before discounting.\n\nConsidering this analysis, I should make a counteroffer that maximizes my value but stays above 519. Here\u2019s a new counteroffer that ensures a better value compared to my outside offer:\n\n- Offer [1, 3, 0, 0, 4]. I keep:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2 (7 - 3 offered)\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5 (9 - 4 offered)\n  \nTotal value I receive:\n- Value from 1 unit of item 1: 77\n- Value from 4 units of item 2: 52\n- Value from 3 units of item 3: 192\n- Value from 1 unit of item 4: 39\n- Value from 5 units of item 5: 180\n\nTotal value: 77 + 52 + 192 + 39 + 180 = 540, which is slightly above my outside offer of 519. \n\nHence, my proposed action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 0, 4]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 519. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

No, because the current offer's value (170) is significantly less than my outside offer (519).\n   - Walk away? It would ensure a value of 519, which is better than the current offer.\n   - Propose a specific counteroffer? Any counteroffer must ensure I get more than 519 in value.

It might be good to calculate the maximum value for me, and then try to see if there's a potential split. I can keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 units, value = 6 * 43 = 258\n    *   Item 2: 2 unit, value = 2 * 48 = 96\n    *   Item 3: 3 units, value = 3 * 84 = 252\n    *   Item 4: 3 unit, value = 3 * 42 = 126\n    *   Item 5: 8 units, value = 8 * 7 = 56\n    *   Total value = 258 + 96 + 252 + 126 + 56 = 788.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 365, which is less than my outside offer of 402.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the negotiation remains unresolved until the final round, the value is significantly decreased for both parties compared to resolving it earlier.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer to me: [3, 1, 1, 1, 4]\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n     - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 53 = 212\n     - Total value = 270 + 76 + 1 + 77 + 212 = 636\n   - Compare 636 (current offer value) to my outside offer of 517. The current offer provides higher value than my outside offer, even when considering the discount factor for a potential round 3 (636 \u00d7 0.9 = 572.4).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer value (636) is higher than my outside offer (517) and even higher when discounting for an additional round.\n   - Hence, accepting this offer would be better than walking away or risking making a suboptimal counteroffer which violates Mistake 5.\n\nTherefore, based on the current analysis:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. The value to me is (1 * 8) + (1 * 44) + (1 * 76) + (0 * 60) + (1 * 87) = 8 + 44 + 76 + 0 + 87 = 215.\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer's value (215) is less than my outside offer (326). Accepting now would be Mistake 4.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**  Let's consider a few scenarios. I need to keep enough to exceed 326.\n   - To calculate a counteroffer, first calculate what I want to keep for myself. I want to keep enough of the items so that my value is > 326. Let's try keeping at least 3 units of Item 5 (3 * 87 = 261). I have 326 - 261 = 65 left that I need to generate from the rest of the items.\n   I could get to 65 with item 3 by keeping 1 unit (76).\n   Counteroffer A: Let's consider a scenario where I keep 3 units of item 5 and 1 units of item 3, I keep the rest.\n   Then I keep 5 item 1, 3 item 2, 1 item 3, 0 item 4, 3 item 5\n   I give 0 item 1, 0 item 2, 5 item 3, 1 item 4, 0 item 5.\n   (5*8) + (3*44) + (1*76) + (0*60) + (3*87) = 40 + 132 + 76 + 0 + 261 = 509\n\n   This means I can counteroffer 0 item 1, 0 item 2, 5 item 3, 1 item 4, 0 item 5 to the other player.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept.\n   - I could walk away, but there are two rounds left.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer for me.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 5, 1, 0]}\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 2, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 322\n   - Item values: item 1: 71, item 2: 51, item 3: 9, item 4: 70, item 5: 63\n   - Total items: item 1: 2, item 2: 8, item 3: 6, item 4: 3, item 5: 1\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [1, 3, 2, 3, 0] (This is what *I* receive)\n      - Value of current offer: (1 * 71) + (3 * 51) + (2 * 9) + (3 * 70) + (0 * 63) = 71 + 153 + 18 + 210 + 0 = 452\n      - Since 452 > 322 (my outside offer), accepting the current offer is better than walking away *in this round*.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - To make an informed counteroffer, I need to think about what Player 1 might find acceptable. The goal is to maximize my own value while still reaching an agreement. Let's start by checking what items Player 1 is offering to me and then calculating how much of each item Player 1 is keeping.\n   - I will receive [1, 3, 2, 3, 0] according to the current offer on the table. The original available items are [2, 8, 6, 3, 1]. Therefore, Player 1 gets [1, 5, 4, 0, 1].\n   - I think I should be able to get more than the current offer.\n\n4) **Decision:** Since 452 is significantly better than 322, it would be a mistake to walk away. Now let's consider a possible counteroffer. Player 1 is currently receiving [1, 5, 4, 0, 1]. Let's propose to give them [1, 6, 5, 0, 1].\nThis means I will receive [1, 2, 1, 3, 0]. This would give me a value of (1 * 71) + (2 * 51) + (1 * 9) + (3 * 70) + (0 * 63) = 71 + 102 + 9 + 210 + 0 = 392.\nWhile this counteroffer is worse than the current offer, it is still better than my outside offer. Now, let's propose a counteroffer where I receive at least my outside offer of 322 *before* discounting. To receive an offer better than my outside offer, I need to have a few of the better-value items such as items 1, 2, and 4.\n\nSince it is round 1, let's make a more aggressive counteroffer to Player 1.\n\nLet's propose to give Player 1 [0, 5, 5, 0, 0].\nThis would mean I receive [2, 3, 1, 3, 1]. This gives me a total value of (2 * 71) + (3 * 51) + (1 * 9) + (3 * 70) + (1 * 63) = 142 + 153 + 9 + 210 + 63 = 577.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 5, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 322\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1: 71, Item 2: 51, Item 3: 9, Item 4: 70, Item 5: 63\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 8, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 1\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 71 = 71\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 51 = 51\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 9 = 9\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 70 = 70\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 63 = 63\n    *   Total value of current offer: 71 + 51 + 9 + 70 + 63 = 264\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer (264) is less than my outside offer (322). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\nLet's consider a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 some items, keeping the rest for myself. Remember my values for the items are: Item 1: 71, Item 2: 51, Item 3: 9, Item 4: 70, Item 5: 63.\n\nI have the following items to divide: Item 1: 2, Item 2: 8, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 1\n\nHere's the history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 5, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nPlayer 1 seems to value items 1, 2, and 4 more than items 3 and 5. It is hard to tell their exact values since I do not know what they value more.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that is better than my outside option. I want to maximize my own value.\nI have 2 units of item 1, 8 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\nLet's consider an offer where I give Player 1: [1, 4, 3, 2, 0]\nThat means I keep:\nItem 1: 1 * 71 = 71\nItem 2: 4 * 51 = 204\nItem 3: 3 * 9 = 27\nItem 4: 1 * 70 = 70\nItem 5: 1 * 63 = 63\nMy total value is 71+204+27+70+63 = 435.\n\nOkay, this seems like a reasonable offer, as my value is 435 which is higher than my outside option.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] is worth 264, which is less than my outside offer value of 322, I should not accept it. I also should not walk away as I believe I can get a deal better than 322. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer of [1, 4, 3, 2, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 3, 2, 0]}\n```",

It's important to avoid delaying unless it enhances the deal significantly.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** None, as this is the first round.\n   \n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     We need to propose a division that nets us a value greater than our outside offer of 506.\n   \n   - Calculate possible counteroffer divisions to evaluate my total value:\n     - I aim to keep items with higher value, particularly item 1 and item 5. I plan to offer Player 2 fewer of those and prioritize giving away items with less personal value to me, like item 3 and item 4.\n   \n     For example, consider the scenario where I keep 4 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. Therefore, I offer the other player:\n\n     - Offer to Player 2: [1, 0, 2, 4, 1]\n     - My retained items: [4, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n     \n     Calculate my value:\n     - Value of 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 93 = 372\n     - Value of 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n     - Value of 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n     - Total value = 372 + 0 + 29 + 0 + 56 = 457\n   \n   This potential offer does not reach my outside offer value of 506. I need to adjust to keep more value.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n   Since I need to maximize my value above 506, let's adjust the offer to align with a higher retention of items 1 and 5, and less of item 3.\n\n   - New proposal:\n     - Offer Player 2: [1, 0, 1, 4, 1]\n     - My retained items: [4, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n   \n   Recalculate my value:\n   - Value of 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 93 = 372\n   - Value of 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n   - Value of 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n   - Value of 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n   - Value of 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n   - Total value = 372 + 0 + 58 + 0 + 56 = 486\n\n   This value (486) is closer but still slightly below my outside offer (506). However, due to the discount factor and negotiation dynamics, I'm offering something appealing that might lead to a future beneficial counteroffer.\n\n   Given the calculations, my decision is to make the counteroffer in hopes of adjusting in subsequent rounds or coming closer to an agreement worthwhile for both.\n\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 4, 1]}",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 1, 4, 1]. This means:\n    *   1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 92 = 92\n    *   0 units of item 2 = 0 * 58 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 48 = 48\n    *   4 units of item 4 = 4 * 36 = 144\n    *   1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 74 = 74\n    *   Total value of current offer = 92 + 0 + 48 + 144 + 74 = 358\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (358) is less than my outside offer (538). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 538. Since Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 4, 1], they are keeping [4, 0, 2, 0, 1]. My goal is to offer Player 1 something that they might consider acceptable, while leaving me with a value greater than 538. I have 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]:\n    *   I keep: [3, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n    *   Value to me: (3 * 92) + (0 * 58) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 36) + (1 * 74) = 276 + 0 + 96 + 72 + 74 = 518\n\n    Still not better than the outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n    * I keep [4, 0, 3, 4, 2]\n    * Value to me: (4 * 92) + (0 * 58) + (3 * 48) + (4 * 36) + (2 * 74) = 368 + 0 + 144 + 144 + 148 = 804\n\n    That is better than the outside offer, but offering that little might be seen as offensive.\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]:\n    * I keep [4, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n    * Value to me: (4 * 92) + (0 * 58) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 36) + (2 * 74) = 368 + 0 + 96 + 72 + 148 = 684\n\n    That is better than the outside offer, but perhaps they will reject it.\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]:\n    * I keep [5, 0, 3, 3, 2]\n    * Value to me: (5 * 92) + (0 * 58) + (3 * 48) + (3 * 36) + (2 * 74) = 460 + 0 + 144 + 108 + 148 = 860\n\n    That offer seems too skewed towards myself, likely causing rejection.\n\n    It is risky, but let's offer player 1 the counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nI should propose a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer, and is plausible enough that Player 1 will consider it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",

Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n*   **Consider a potential counteroffer:** I have Item 1: 4 units, Item 2: 0 units, Item 3: 2 units, Item 4: 0 units, Item 5: 2 units.\n\n    To exceed my outside option, the discounted offer needs to be 538 / 0.9 = 597.78\n\n    Let's look at the original counteroffer:\n    Player 2 offered Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n    Which means Player 2 kept [4, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n    Value to Player 2: (4 * 92) + (0 * 58) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 36) + (2 * 74)\n    Value to Player 2: 368 + 0 + 96 + 72 + 148 = 684\n\n    The discounted value is 684 * 0.9 = 615.6\n\n    Let's try the following Counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    Which means Player 2 keeps [5, 0, 3, 4, 2]\n    Value to Player 2: (5 * 92) + (0 * 58) + (3 * 48) + (4 * 36) + (2 * 74)\n    Value to Player 2: 460 + 0 + 144 + 144 + 148 = 896\n    The discounted value is 896 * 0.9 = 806.4\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible (255.6 < 538). I can do better with my outside offer, and with a counteroffer.\n\nGiven that the highest possible value for the item division for me is 896, and given that the discount factor is 0.9, I am likely to get more by waiting another round and then potentially getting more. Therefore I will offer nothing.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 506.\n\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 93 per unit\n  - Item 2: 96 per unit (not available)\n  - Item 3: 29 per unit\n  - Item 4: 11 per unit\n  - Item 5: 56 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n- **Current Offer:** The current offer from Player 2 gives me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which is essentially nothing.\n\n- **Discount Factor:** Being in the last round, the negotiation value now is multiplied by gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. This applies to offers made and accepted in this round.\n\n### 2. Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Value of Current Offer:**\n  Since I'm being offered nothing, my value of accepting this would be 0.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  I need to maximize my value while considering my outside offer of 506. Any counteroffer should ensure that my value for the remainder of the items is greater than 506.\n\n  To ensure I achieve more than my outside offer:\n\n  Calculate the value if I keep:\n  - All 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 93 = 465\n  - All 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n  - All 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 11 = 44\n  - All 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n\n  Total: 465 + 87 + 44 + 112 = 708\n\n  At a discounting rate of 0.81, the value remains more than 506. \n\n  Hence offering Player 2 a small amount of items while retaining the majority would still leave a value above my outside offer.\n\n### 3. Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nTo maximize the value for myself and ensure it exceeds 506 after considering the discount factor, I will choose a division giving:\n- Player 2: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nThe calculation for my share (for what I keep):\n- Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 93 = 372\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 29 = 58\n- Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 11 = 33\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 56 = 56\n\nTotal: 372 + 58 + 33 + 56 = 519\nAfter discounting, 519 * 0.81 = 420.39, which is greater than zero, ensuring Player 2 also benefits from the nonzero offer.\n\nThus: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1].\n    *   My value if I accept:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 72 = 72\n        *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 77 = 154\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 70 = 70\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 53 = 53\n        *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 23 = 23\n        *   Total value: 72 + 154 + 70 + 53 + 23 = 372\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 372, which is less than my outside offer of 487.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that would give me a value greater than 487. Since I am in round 1, I need to consider the potential payoff after the discount factor is applied in the next round.\n    *   Suppose I offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], then my value would be: (4*72)+(4*77)+(4*70)+(4*53)+(3*23) = 288 + 308 + 280 + 212 + 69 = 1157.\n    *   Suppose I offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], then my value would be: (3*72)+(3*77)+(3*70)+(3*53)+(2*23) = 216 + 231 + 210 + 159 + 46 = 862.\n\n3. **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer (372) is worse than my outside offer (487). Therefore, I should not accept.\n*   I could walk away now and get 487.\n*   Alternatively, I can make a counteroffer to try and get a better deal. If I make an offer that gives me more than 487 *after the discount factor is applied in the next round*, then that would be better than my current outside offer. 487 / 0.9 = 541.11. Any offer I make now that is worth more than this next turn is worth considering.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer. If I offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], my value would be 862, which is larger than 487.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 410\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 59, Item 2: 27, Item 3: 20, Item 4: 64, Item 5: 63\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 59 = 59\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 27 = 27\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 20 = 20\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 64 = 192\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 63 = 126\n    *   **Total value:** 59 + 27 + 20 + 192 + 126 = 424\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 424, which is greater than my outside offer of 410.\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffers**\n\nThe other player's last offer was [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]. I previously countered with [2, 1, 0, 2, 1].\nMy previous counteroffer gave Player 1:\n2 * 59 + 1 * 27 + 0 * 20 + 2 * 64 + 1 * 63 = 118 + 27 + 0 + 128 + 63 = 336\nWhich meant I got\n3 * 59 + 2 * 27 + 2 * 20 + 3 * 64 + 4 * 63 = 177 + 54 + 40 + 192 + 252 = 715\n\nPlayer 1's last offer gives me a value of 424. If I accept it, my value would be 424 * (0.9)^1 = 381.6\nThe total item value is 5 * 59 + 3 * 27 + 2 * 20 + 5 * 64 + 5 * 63 = 295 + 81 + 40 + 320 + 315 = 1051\n\nI should attempt to get more items.\nI will make a counteroffer, giving the other player: [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]\nThis means I keep:\n4 * 59 + 3 * 27 + 2 * 20 + 3 * 64 + 4 * 63 = 236 + 81 + 40 + 192 + 252 = 801\n\n4) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (424) is greater than my outside option (410), I should not walk away. I also should not accept the current offer, because I can propose a better offer for myself. Since it's round 2, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analysis of the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 203\n*   My values for the items: item 1: 85, item 2: 34, item 3: 71, item 4: 71, item 5: 68\n*   Total pool of items: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assessment of the offer:**\n\n*   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]. This means they are offering me all 4 units of item 5.\n*   Value of accepting the current offer: 4 * 68 = 272.\n*   Comparison to outside offer: 272 > 203. Accepting the offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Possible actions:**\n\n*   Accept: Value = 272\n*   Walk: Value = 203\n*   Counteroffer: This is a tricky situation, as I need to determine if making a counteroffer is worthwhile given the discount factor.\n\nLet's consider a simple split where each player receives about half the total value. My total value for all items is (3 * 85) + (4 * 34) + (2 * 71) + (3 * 71) + (4 * 68) = 255 + 136 + 142 + 213 + 272 = 1018.  Half of this is 509. Let's see if I can propose an offer that would get me something close to this without being rejected.\nSince Player 1 is offering all of item 5, I could ask for item 1. That is worth 3 * 85 = 255. If I give 1 unit each of items 3 and 4 to player 1 this is a total of 71+71=142. So player 1 keeps the 4 units of item 5, and I give him item 3 and 4 of 1 each.\n\nI propose giving them [3, 4, 1, 1, 0] in the hopes they will accept. This is equivalent to offering me [0, 0, 1, 2, 4] and is worth (1 * 71) + (2 * 71) + (4 * 68) = 71 + 142 + 272 = 485. This is worse than the current offer of 272.\n\nSince the current offer is better than my outside offer, and it's round 1, I will accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This would yield: (3 * 87) + (1 * 28) + (3 * 4) + (1 * 64) + (1 * 71) = 261 + 28 + 12 + 64 + 71 = 436\n   - Discount factor in round 1 is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so if I accept this in round 1, the offer is worth 75.\n   - Discount factor in round 2 is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9, so I want to ensure that any offer in round 2 is at least 108/0.9 = 120\n\n4) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is worth 75, which is less than my outside offer of 108. Accepting would be Mistake 4.\n   - Keeping everything would be ideal.\n   - Let's try to get most of the value. A reasonable counteroffer would be something that gives me more than 108.\n   - I will offer [2, 0, 2, 0, 0] to the other player. This means I keep 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. My value = (1 * 87) + (1 * 28) + (1 * 4) + (1 * 64) + (1 * 71) = 87 + 28 + 4 + 64 + 71 = 254\n   - Offering [3, 1, 3, 1, 1] would give me 0, which would be Mistake 2.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 [2, 0, 2, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

My value is:\n        *   2 * 37 + 3 * 83 + 3 * 89 + 2 * 44 + 5 * 38 = 74 + 249 + 267 + 88 + 190 = 868\n        *   This is less than 988, so this offer is not good.\n    *   **Scenario 2:** I give Player 1 [1, 2, 2, 1, 4]. This means I keep [3, 3, 3, 3, 7]. My value is:\n        *   3 * 37 + 3 * 83 + 3 * 89 + 3 * 44 + 7 * 38 = 111 + 249 + 267 + 132 + 266 = 1025\n        *   This is greater than 988, so this offer is better than walking away.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible (443 < 988).

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value is 988.\n    *   My values for the items are: item 1 = 37, item 2 = 83, item 3 = 89, item 4 = 44, item 5 = 38.\n    *   Total items: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 11 units of item 5.\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 1, 0, 6].\n        *   Value of 2 units of item 1: 2 * 37 = 74\n        *   Value of 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 83 = 83\n        *   Value of 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 89 = 89\n        *   Value of 0 units of item 4: 0 * 44 = 0\n        *   Value of 6 units of item 5: 6 * 38 = 228\n        *   Total value of current offer: 74 + 83 + 89 + 0 + 228 = 474\n        *   Discounted value of current offer: 474 * 0.9 = 426.6\n    *   **Comparison to outside offer:** 426.6 < 988. Accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n    *   **Consider the previous offers:**\n\n        *   Player 1's first offer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 5]. My value: (1 * 37) + (1 * 83) + (1 * 89) + (1 * 44) + (5 * 38) = 37 + 83 + 89 + 44 + 190 = 443. Discounted value: 443 * 0.9 = 398.7\n        *   My first offer: [1, 2, 2, 1, 4]. This means I would keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5. This has a value to me of (3*37) + (3*83) + (3*89) + (3*44) + (7*38) = 111 + 249 + 267 + 132 + 266 = 1025.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to offer something that is worth more than my outside offer when discounted in the next round (i.e., worth > 988/0.9 = 1097.77). This means I need to keep a substantial portion of the items.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n    *   I need to make a counteroffer that gives me more value while also being acceptable to Player 1.\n\n    Let's evaluate what it would take for me to get to my outside offer value (undiscounted). I would need to keep items valued at 988 or more. This can be difficult to achieve given that Player 1 must also get some items of value.\n\n    I will propose keeping all of item 2 and item 3. That would give me 5*83 + 5*89 = 415 + 445 = 860. Then, keeping all 4 of item 1 is 4 * 37 = 148, adding to 1008. So, giving away all of item 4 and item 5 and some small amount of items 1, 2, and 3 is the best starting point. So let's give them 1 unit of item 1. This gives me 3 units * 37 = 111. 5 item 2 = 415. 5 item 3 = 445. 4 item 4 = 176. 11 item 5 = 418. 111+415+445+176+418=1565. Giving them 1 unit of item 1 and all units of item 4 and 5: [1, 0, 0, 4, 11].\n\n    Value to me is (3*37)+(5*83)+(5*89)+(0*44)+(0*38) = 111 + 415 + 445 + 0 + 0 = 971\n    Value to me is 971 * 0.9 = 873.9 so this is suboptimal.\n\nLet me offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 2, 6]. This would mean for me:\n* 3 item 1 (3 * 37 = 111)\n* 4 item 2 (4 * 83 = 332)\n* 4 item 3 (4 * 89 = 356)\n* 2 item 4 (2 * 44 = 88)\n* 5 item 5 (5 * 38 = 190)\nValue to me is 111 + 332 + 356 + 88 + 190 = 1077\n1077 * 0.9 = 969.3\n\nLet me offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 2, 6].

Since it is round 3, I'll only consider counteroffers that yield more than 850 in this round itself, which is not feasible given the current values and items remaining.\n\nTherefore, the optimal decision is to walk away, as this guarantees my outside offer value of 850, which is better than the value of the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to adjust to try to reach a value closer or above my outside offer.\n\n- Let's try another value:\n\n  - 0 units of item 1 (give 4)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (give 4)\n  - 3 units of item 3 (give 0)\n  - 0 unit of item 4 (give 4)\n  - 2 units of item 5 (give 0)\n\n I keep:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 59 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n  - 0 unit of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 12 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54\n\n Total value = 0 + 90 + 12 + 0 + 54 = 156 \n\nThis also doesn't reach the outside offer.\n\nConsider an offer that is likely to be rejected quickly but will establish a strong initial position:\n\n- Give Player 2:\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\nKeep:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n  - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 90 = 450\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nTotal value = 236 + 450 + 12 = 698 \n\nStill less than my outside offer. At minimal, I need to retain items to maintain above optimal value.\n\nGiven the items and values, it appears I'm best off walking based on my outside offer unless I can get uniquely favorable terms from Player 2.\n  \n3) Final Decision:\n   - Since neither distribution I speculated reached my outside offer of 763 and surpasses my fallback naturally more favorable, it would be prudent to consider a valid distribution in later rounds.\n    \n   - As such, the optimal first offer to stay strategically strong and negotiate is a distribution:\n     - I give: 3 units item 1, 4 unit item 3, 4 unit item 4, 2 units item 5\n     - Keep 0 units items for total:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 59 \u00d7 1 = 59\n       - 5 units of item 2 = 450\n     If acceptable, adjust in subsequent rounds. \n\nThus, my decision is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 4, 4, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 177.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 60, 81, 33, 36, and 93, respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** The current offer gives me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This means Player 1 is offering me [0,1,1,0,0]. Therefore I would be receiving 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. The total value of this offer to me is (2 * 60) + (1 * 81) + (3 * 33) + (3 * 36) + (2 * 93) = 120 + 81 + 99 + 108 + 186 = 594.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer might look like. I want to get a value greater than 177. I will keep this in mind when deciding what to offer.\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 594, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 177.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is good (worth 594). However, I want to maximize my payoff. Perhaps Player 1 is low-balling at the start. I will make a counteroffer, trying to secure a better deal, but without being too greedy.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that offers Player 1 half of item 1, half of item 2, half of item 3, half of item 4, and half of item 5 (rounding to whole numbers since we can't have fractions of items).\n\nSo, the counteroffer will be:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 1 unit\nItem 5: 1 unit\n\nThis offer to Player 1 means I would get:\nItem 1: 1 unit (value 60)\nItem 2: 1 unit (value 81)\nItem 3: 2 units (value 66)\nItem 4: 2 units (value 72)\nItem 5: 1 unit (value 93)\nMy total value would be 60 + 81 + 66 + 72 + 93 = 372. This is much greater than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1007.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 98, item 2 = 92, item 3 = 73, item 4 = 30, item 5 = 57.\n   - The total pool of items is: 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9.

This means I receive:\n      - 2 units of item 1\n      - 0 units of item 2\n      - 1 units of item 3\n      - 1 units of item 4\n      - 1 units of item 5\n      My value for this offer is (2 * 98) + (0 * 92) + (1 * 73) + (1 * 30) + (1 * 57) = 196 + 0 + 73 + 30 + 57 = 356.\n      Since 356 is much smaller than my outside option of 1007, I should not accept this offer.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Since I have not yet made any offers, I want to propose a counteroffer that will be high enough for player 1 to consider, but also leave me with a value greater than 1007. There are 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 available.\n\n   -Considerations:\n        - It's round 1, so time isn't as big a factor yet, but I still don't want to waste time with bad offers.\n        - I want to offer just enough to player 1 to make it better than their outside offer to try and get an agreement in the next round.\n\n   - Possible Counteroffer:\n      Let's try offering player 1 the following: [3, 1, 2, 1, 2].

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 669. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 780 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action for Round 1.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 669\n   - My values for items: item 1 = 75, item 2 = 58, item 3 = 52, item 4 = 25, item 5 = 50\n   - Total pool of items: 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in later rounds is worth less than a deal made now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [1, 3, 0, 1, 3] (meaning they keep the rest). This means I get:\n      - 1 unit of item 1\n      - 3 units of item 2\n      - 0 units of item 3\n      - 1 unit of item 4\n      - 3 units of item 5\n   - Value of current offer to me: (1 * 75) + (3 * 58) + (0 * 52) + (1 * 25) + (3 * 50) = 75 + 174 + 0 + 25 + 150 = 424\n\n   - Comparison to outside offer: 424 < 669. The current offer is worth less than my outside offer.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: Before considering specific counteroffers, let's calculate the total value of all the items to me:\n      - (5 * 75) + (6 * 58) + (3 * 52) + (7 * 25) + (5 * 50) = 375 + 348 + 156 + 175 + 250 = 1304\n      - I need to ensure that any counteroffer results in me getting a value greater than 669. Also, since this is the first round, I want to make a somewhat aggressive counteroffer.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer (424) is worse than my outside offer (669).\n   - Walking away would give me 669.\n   - I should make a counteroffer. I need to determine a distribution that gives Player 1 enough value to be appealing, while still giving me a value greater than 669.\n\nLet's aim for a split that gives Player 1 roughly similar or slightly more value based on what they offered to start with, while ensuring my value exceeds 669. My initial inclination is that player 1 has made an offer skewed to themselves. Given this, I should respond with a counteroffer that is skewed to my value.\n\nLet's propose giving Player 1 [4, 3, 1, 6, 2]. This would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 5 - 4 = 1 unit (value 75)\n- Item 2: 6 - 3 = 3 units (value 174)\n- Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units (value 104)\n- Item 4: 7 - 6 = 1 unit (value 25)\n- Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units (value 150)\nTotal value for me: 75 + 174 + 104 + 25 + 150 = 528. This is worse than my outside offer.\n\nLet's propose giving Player 1 [2, 2, 1, 3, 1]. This would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units (value 225)\n- Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4 units (value 232)\n- Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units (value 104)\n- Item 4: 7 - 3 = 4 units (value 100)\n- Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units (value 200)\nTotal value for me: 225 + 232 + 104 + 100 + 200 = 861.

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now. For example, if accepting now is worth $100, accepting in round 2 is worth $90, and accepting in round 3 is worth $81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 5]. This means I would get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. My value would be:\n      (1 * 78) + (1 * 90) + (0 * 23) + (0 * 54) + (5 * 45) = 78 + 90 + 0 + 0 + 225 = 393.\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 393 is much less than my outside offer of 910.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a reasonable amount while still leaving me with a value greater than 910.\n     - Item 1: total 6. Let's give Player 1 3 units. I keep 3. Value: 3 * 78 = 234\n     - Item 2: total 3. Let's give Player 1 1 unit. I keep 2. Value: 2 * 90 = 180\n     - Item 3: total 0. I keep 0. Value: 0 * 23 = 0\n     - Item 4: total 2. Let's give Player 1 1 unit. I keep 1. Value: 1 * 54 = 54\n     - Item 5: total 9. Let's give Player 1 4 units. I keep 5. Value: 5 * 45 = 225\n     Total value: 234 + 180 + 0 + 54 + 225 = 693. This is still less than 910.\n\n     Let's try another counteroffer.\n     - Item 1: total 6. Let's give Player 1 2 units. I keep 4. Value: 4 * 78 = 312\n     - Item 2: total 3. Let's give Player 1 0 unit. I keep 3. Value: 3 * 90 = 270\n     - Item 3: total 0. I keep 0. Value: 0 * 23 = 0\n     - Item 4: total 2. Let's give Player 1 0 unit. I keep 2. Value: 2 * 54 = 108\n     - Item 5: total 9. Let's give Player 1 4 units. I keep 5. Value: 5 * 45 = 225\n     Total value: 312 + 270 + 0 + 108 + 225 = 915. This is slightly greater than 910.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is worth 393, which is far less than my outside offer of 910. I should reject it.\n   - I could walk away and take my outside offer of 910.\n   - I could propose a counteroffer. A potential counteroffer is to offer Player 1 [2, 0, 0, 0, 4].

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 0, 0, 4]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 910\n*   **Values of the items involved:**\n    *   Item 1: 78\n    *   Item 2: 90\n    *   Item 3: 23\n    *   Item 4: 54\n    *   Item 5: 45\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 6 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 0 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 9 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that if we reach round 3, the value of any agreement will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   0 unit of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 78) + (1 * 90) + (0 * 23) + (1 * 54) + (2 * 45) = 78 + 90 + 0 + 54 + 90 = 312\n    Since it's round 2, the value is 312 * 0.9^(2-1) = 312 * 0.9 = 280.8\n*   **Comparison to my outside offer:** 280.8 < 910, so accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n*   **My previous offer**: I offered player 1 [2, 0, 0, 0, 4]. This means I would get:\n    * 4 units of Item 1\n    * 3 units of Item 2\n    * 0 units of Item 3\n    * 2 units of Item 4\n    * 5 units of Item 5\n    Value = (4 * 78) + (3 * 90) + (0 * 23) + (2 * 54) + (5 * 45) = 312 + 270 + 0 + 108 + 225 = 915\n    Round 1 value would be 915 * 0.9^0 = 915\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n\nI need to get at least 910 / 0.9 = 1011.11 worth of goods in this round to equal walking away\n\n*   Giving them nothing:\n    *   Value = (6 * 78) + (3 * 90) + (0 * 23) + (2 * 54) + (9 * 45) = 468 + 270 + 0 + 108 + 405 = 1251. So I want to give them something.\n    *   I need to keep enough to be above 1011.11, therefore I need to offer them less than 1251 - 1011.11 = 239.89\n    *   The offer from player 1 to me is worth 280.8. Therefore I need to propose an offer where I get a higher value\n*   My previous offer got me 915, so I could make an offer similar to this but better.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]:\n    *   I get: 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n    *   Value: (5 * 78) + (3 * 90) + (0 * 23) + (2 * 54) + (6 * 45) = 390 + 270 + 0 + 108 + 270 = 1038\n    *   Adjusted for round 2 = 1038 * 0.9 = 934.2\n    *   Which is above my outside offer of 910\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside option.

I'll aim for an offer that ensures I keep a significant portion of the items due to the high outside offer value.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2:\n\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 5 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\n**Calculating My Value:**\n\n- Item 1: (5 - 2) \u00d7 24 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n- Item 2: (10 - 5) \u00d7 51 = 5 \u00d7 51 = 255\n- Item 3: (4 - 1) \u00d7 88 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n- Item 4: (7 - 3) \u00d7 57 = 4 \u00d7 57 = 228\n- Item 5: (4 - 1) \u00d7 40 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120\n\n**Total value:** 72 + 255 + 264 + 228 + 120 = 939\n\nThe calculated value is 939, which is below my outside offer of 1477. To avoid Mistake 2, I need a better deal as keeping more items can raise my total.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nSince the calculated value of my proposed division was below my outside offer, I should seek to hold and evaluate or propose a counteroffer. The aim is to maximize retention while ensuring a value at least close to or greater than my outside offer, the latter not being possible currently.\n\n#### Counteroffer Proposal:\nI should suggest offering Player 2 a smaller portion, where my retention will get closer to my outside offer:\n\n- Let's adjust to offer:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\nThis adjustment seeks to maximize retention:\n\n- Item 1: (5 - 1) \u00d7 24 = 4 \u00d7 24 = 96\n- Item 2: (10 - 3) \u00d7 51 = 7 \u00d7 51 = 357\n- Item 3: 4 \u00d7 88 = 352\n- Item 4: (7 - 2) \u00d7 57 = 5 \u00d7 57 = 285\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 40 = 160\n\n**New total value:** 96 + 357 + 352 + 285 + 160 = 1250\n\nThis is better yet still under my outside offer value, but ensures I don't walk without exploring possibilities to improve deals. I anticipate negotiating from this base could yield mutual benefit or acceptance below an outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1159. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means any deal we make now is worth 90% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    The value of this offer to me is: (0 * 3) + (1 * 51) + (2 * 60) + (2 * 29) + (2 * 16) = 0 + 51 + 120 + 58 + 32 = 261.\n    Accounting for the discount factor, the present value of accepting this offer is 261 * 0.9 = 234.9.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (234.9) is significantly less than my outside offer (481). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. Since I rejected Player 1's first offer, and they are repeating the offer, I should make a counteroffer closer to my outside offer. Player 1's offer from Round 1 was [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]. My offer was [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], so I will counter with an offer more favorable to me, but not so greedy that Player 1 walks away. I want to keep most of item 2 and item 3 since they have a high value for me. I will offer Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   4 units of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n    The value of this to me is: (0 * 3) + (3 * 51) + (4 * 60) + (3 * 29) + (3 * 16) = 0 + 153 + 240 + 87 + 48 = 528.\n    Accounting for the discount factor, the present value is 528 * 0.9 = 475.2.\n\n    Offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   5 units of item 3\n    *   4 units of item 4\n    *   4 units of item 5\n    The value of this to me is: (1 * 3) + (3 * 51) + (5 * 60) + (4 * 29) + (4 * 16) = 3 + 153 + 300 + 116 + 64 = 636.\n    Accounting for the discount factor, the present value is 636 * 0.9 = 572.4.\n    This would be the best outcome for me.\n\n    Offering Player 1 [1, 1, 2, 2, 2] means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    The value of this to me is: (0 * 3) + (2 * 51) + (3 * 60) + (2 * 29) + (2 * 16) = 0 + 102 + 180 + 58 + 32 = 372.\n    Accounting for the discount factor, the present value is 372 * 0.9 = 334.8.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away means I get my outside offer.\n*   I can make a counteroffer that could be better than my outside offer.\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1, keeping all the items for myself.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 163.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1: 77, item 2: 58, item 3: 88, item 4: 89, item 5: 54.\n*   The total pool of items is: 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n*   The current offer is [3, 1, 1, 1, 1] to *me*. This means Player 1 is offering me 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n    *   Value of 3 units of item 1: 3 * 77 = 231\n    *   Value of 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 58 = 58\n    *   Value of 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 88 = 88\n    *   Value of 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 89 = 89\n    *   Value of 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 54 = 54\n    *   Total value of current offer: 231 + 58 + 88 + 89 + 54 = 520\n\n*   My outside offer is 163. The current offer is worth 520, which is significantly greater than 163.\n\n3) **Consider a Counteroffer:**\nI need to figure out what's a good counteroffer to propose. Let's calculate the value if Player 1 is offering me [3, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nThe total number of items are [5, 3, 4, 4, 3].\nSo if Player 1 is offering me [3, 1, 1, 1, 1], then Player 1 is taking [2, 2, 3, 3, 2].\n\nFor example, if I counteroffer [2, 1, 2, 2, 1] to Player 1, then I am taking [3, 2, 2, 2, 2], which has a value of 3*77 + 2*58 + 2*88 + 2*89 + 2*54 = 231 + 116 + 176 + 178 + 108 = 809.\n\nLet's see if I should take the current offer versus counteroffer [2,1,2,2,1].\nCurrent Offer Value is 520. Outside Offer Value is 163. Counter offer yields 809, and a discount factor of 0.9, will reduce that to 728.1. So it's still better to counteroffer.\n\n**Decision:** The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, but it's round 1. I should attempt to improve the offer by making a counteroffer that is favorable for both sides.\n\nSince Player 1 is requesting [2,2,3,3,2], let's offer a little less. [1,0,1,1,0]\nI am offering player 1 [1,0,1,1,0], so I will keep [4, 3, 3, 3, 3]. Value will be 4*77+3*58+3*88+3*89+3*54 = 308+174+264+267+162=1175.

Since the opponent offered me a significant value, I would need to offer a very favorable counteroffer to potentially improve upon 374 * 0.9 = 336.6 (discounted value if the negotiation continues to round 2). A profitable counteroffer needs to ensure that my valuation of remaining items is greater than my outside option and greater than or equal to 336.6\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 374, which is far greater than my outside offer of 111. Making a counteroffer could potentially increase my value, but it also carries the risk of the negotiation falling apart. The discounted value is 336.6 so, it will be difficult to come up with a better offer.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 653\n*   Item values: item 1 = 92, item 2 = 8, item 3 = 45, item 4 = 77, item 5 = 7\n*   Total items: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    My value for this offer is: (0 \\* 92) + (0 \\* 8) + (1 \\* 45) + (1 \\* 77) + (2 \\* 7) = 0 + 0 + 45 + 77 + 14 = 136. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 653.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to determine what items I value most and how to formulate a counteroffer that gives Player 1 enough to keep them engaged but maximizes my own value. My highest value items are item 1 (92) and item 4 (77). Item 3 is reasonably valuable at 45. Items 2 (8) and 5 (7) are not very valuable to me. I have to give Player 1 something to make it appealing for them to accept.\n    *I have 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5 to divide. Player 1 currently wants [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]. So, to give to Player 1, I will propose a deal, taking into account they want at least [0, 0, 1, 1, 2].\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** I'll start by giving player 1 more of what they originally requested to gauge their reaction and avoid making a bad first offer. I can offer [1, 0, 2, 2, 4]. If I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 2, 2, 4], I get to keep [3, 2, 3, 1, 5].\n\n    Value to me if I keep [3, 2, 3, 1, 5] is:\n    (3 \\* 92) + (2 \\* 8) + (3 \\* 45) + (1 \\* 77) + (5 \\* 7) = 276 + 16 + 135 + 77 + 35 = 539. This is below my outside option of 653, therefore I want to make a stronger offer to Player 1\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:**\n    Let me try to provide the bare minimum to player 1. Let me offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]. If I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 1, 1, 2], I get to keep [4, 2, 4, 2, 7].\n\n    Value to me if I keep [4, 2, 4, 2, 7] is:\n    (4 \\* 92) + (2 \\* 8) + (4 \\* 45) + (2 \\* 77) + (7 \\* 7) = 368 + 16 + 180 + 154 + 49 = 767\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:**\n    Let me try to offer a value close to my outside option and see if Player 1 accepts. Let me aim to keep items with a value slightly above 653. I can offer [0, 1, 3, 1, 7]. If I offer Player 1 [0, 1, 3, 1, 7], I get to keep [4, 1, 2, 2, 2].\n\n    Value to me if I keep [4, 1, 2, 2, 2] is:\n    (4 \\* 92) + (1 \\* 8) + (2 \\* 45) + (2 \\* 77) + (2 \\* 7) = 368 + 8 + 90 + 154 + 14 = 634. This is less than my outside option, but close.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is very bad (136 << 653). The first counteroffer is bad. Counteroffer 2 is great, and Counteroffer 3 is close. Therefore I'll make counteroffer 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 653\n*   My item values: item 1: 92, item 2: 8, item 3: 45, item 4: 77, item 5: 7\n*   Total items: item 1: 4, item 2: 2, item 3: 5, item 4: 3, item 5: 9\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\nThe current offer on the table is [0, 0, 5, 1, 5] (what I receive). This means:\n* Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n* Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n* Item 3: 5 - 5 = 0 units\n* Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n* Item 5: 9 - 5 = 4 units\nTotal value of the current offer:\n(4 * 92) + (2 * 8) + (0 * 45) + (2 * 77) + (4 * 7) = 368 + 16 + 0 + 154 + 28 = 566\n\nSince it is round 2, we discount this value by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\nDiscounted value = 566 * 0.9 = 509.4\n\n3) **Compare to outside offer:**\nMy outside offer is 653.  The discounted value of the current offer is 509.4, which is much less than my outside offer. So, accepting is worse than walking away.\n\n**Potential Counteroffers:**\n\nI want to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 653.\n\n**Strategy:**\nIt's the second round, and Player 1 seems to be undervaluing items 1, 2, and 4, while overvaluing item 3 and 5.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 close to what they offered me in Round 1 for item 3 and 5, plus a little more of the other items to sweeten the deal for them to accept.\n\nLet's consider giving player 1 the following: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 1, item 4 = 1, item 5 = 2.\n\nIf I offer player 1 [4, 2, 1, 1, 2], that means I keep:\nItem 1: 4 - 4 = 0\nItem 2: 2 - 2 = 0\nItem 3: 5 - 1 = 4\nItem 4: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 5: 9 - 2 = 7\nThe total value to me is (0 * 92) + (0 * 8) + (4 * 45) + (2 * 77) + (7 * 7) = 0 + 0 + 180 + 154 + 49 = 383.\nDiscounted value = 383 * 0.9 = 344.7.\n\nLet's try offering a better split than the previous counter offer on Round 1 and the current offer, by offering Player 1 the following: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nIf I offer player 1 [0, 0, 1, 1, 2], that means I keep:\nItem 1: 4 - 0 = 4\nItem 2: 2 - 0 = 2\nItem 3: 5 - 1 = 4\nItem 4: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 5: 9 - 2 = 7\nThe total value to me is (4 * 92) + (2 * 8) + (4 * 45) + (2 * 77) + (7 * 7) = 368 + 16 + 180 + 154 + 49 = 767.\nDiscounted value = 767 * 0.9 = 690.3.\n\nSince 690.3 > 653, this offer is better than walking away.\n\n4) **Decision:**\nSince the discounted value of the current offer is less than my outside option, I should not accept. I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer now. For example, an offer worth 500 in round 1 is worth 500 * 0.9 = 450 in round 2.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 0, 2, 2, 3] (This is what Player 1 is offering me). This means they keep 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer to me: (0 * 34) + (0 * 93) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 94) + (3 * 16) = 0 + 0 + 34 + 188 + 48 = 270\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 270 < 428. Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nI need to determine a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. Here's my approach:\n\nI want to maximize my value. Items 2 and 4 have the highest value for me. I will try to keep most or all of these. Let's formulate a counteroffer.\nLet's try giving Player 1 half the item 1, 2, 3, 4 and give them zero of Item 5. Thus giving them:\n\n[3, 2, 3, 2, 0]\n\nThis would leave me with:\n\nItem 1: 3 * 34 = 102\nItem 2: 3 * 93 = 279\nItem 3: 3 * 17 = 51\nItem 4: 2 * 94 = 188\nItem 5: 3 * 16 = 48\n\nTotal value = 102 + 279 + 51 + 188 + 48 = 668\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer. It's also much better than the current offer.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (270) is worse than my outside offer (428), I should not accept.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer value:** The current offer gives me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] of each item. This means I keep 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5 for myself. The value of this outcome to me is: (5 * 78) + (3 * 32) + (4 * 49) + (5 * 55) + (2 * 13) = 390 + 96 + 196 + 275 + 26 = 983\n    Since I am offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the value of this offer is:\n    (1 * 78) + (1 * 32) + (1 * 49) + (1 * 55) + (1 * 13) = 78 + 32 + 49 + 55 + 13 = 227\n*   **Value compared to outside offer:** Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 227. This is greater than my outside offer of 189.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince accepting the current offer (which implies I get items worth 983) will give me more value than walking away with my outside offer (189). Therefore I would prefer to keep 983 worth of items, than walk away with 189. I could propose a better counteroffer but I will need to respond without an extensive amount of calculating time, and so I think it is best to accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Sure, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** Your outside offer value is 886.\n   - **Values of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 27 per unit\n     - Item 2: 95 per unit\n     - Item 3: 43 per unit\n     - Item 4: 42 per unit\n     - Item 5: 25 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 9 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n\n   - **Discount Factor:** In round 3, the value of the negotiated offer is not affected by the discount factor because \\(\\gamma^{r-1}\\) where \\(r-1\\) is zero for the final round.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\nFor the current offer [4, 5, 2, 3, 2]:\n\n   - **Value if Accepted (Keeping Remaining):**\n     - Item 1: 3 units remaining = \\(3 \\times 27 = 81\\)\n     - Item 2: 4 units remaining = \\(4 \\times 95 = 380\\)\n     - Item 3: 1 unit remaining = \\(1 \\times 43 = 43\\)\n     - Item 4: 2 units remaining = \\(2 \\times 42 = 84\\)\n     - Item 5: 2 units remaining = \\(2 \\times 25 = 50\\)\n     - Total Value = \\(81 + 380 + 43 + 84 + 50 = 638\\)\n\nThis offer is worse than my outside offer of 886, so I cannot accept it.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince accepting the current offer gives me 638, which is worse than my outside offer of 886, accepting would conflict with Mistake 4. Similarly, we cannot accept this offer to avoid Mistake 5. We should therefore consider a counteroffer to try to achieve a value greater than 886 or choose to WALK.\n\nA reasonable counteroffer should ensure a higher value than my outside offer:\n\n- If I keep at least a couple of high-value items, I can potentially achieve more value. I will try offering [7, 4, 1, 0, 1]:\n   - Keep Item 1: \\(0 \\times 27 = 0\\)\n   - Keep Item 2: \\(5 \\times 95 = 475\\)\n   - Keep Item 3: \\(2 \\times 43 = 86\\)\n   - Keep Item 4: \\(5 \\times 42 = 210\\)\n   - Keep Item 5: \\(3 \\times 25 = 75\\)\n   - Total Value = \\(475 + 86 + 210 + 75 = 846\\)\n\nThis isn't reaching higher than 886. I will refine it again. The goal is to keep taking highest valued item 2 units for maximum value.\n\nLet's offer [7, 4, 1, 5, 3]:\n\n- Keep Item 1: \\(0 \\times 27 = 0\\)\n- Keep Item 2: \\(5 \\times 95 = 475\\)\n- Keep Item 3: \\(2 \\times 43 = 86\\)\n- Keep Item 4: \\(0 \\times 42 = 0\\)\n- Keep Item 5: \\(1 \\times 25 = 25\\)\n- Total Value = \\(475 + 86 + 25 = 586\\)\n\nValue is lower than 886; hence offering all doesn't work.

I will offer the remaining items to Player 2:\n       - Keep 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n       - Keep 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n       - Keep 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n       - Keep 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n       - Keep 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n       - Total value = 711\n\n   - Comparing this to my outside offer value (141), the total value (711) is much higher and would be an acceptable counteroffer as it exceeds my fallback position.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   - Since I don't have a current offer to accept, and walking away would result in receiving just 141, which is less favorable compared to the value of the counteroffer plan I've calculated (711), proposing a counteroffer is optimal.\n\nHere's my action based on the analysis:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 3, 1]} \n\nThis offer grants Player 2 lower-value items based on my valuation but is fair and might lead to an agreement.",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 2, 1, 3, 1]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 62 = 62\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 1 = 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 77 = 231\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 81 = 81\n    *   Total value of current offer: 62 + 2 + 45 + 231 + 81 = 421\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (421) is much less than my outside offer (911).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  Since the current offer is significantly below my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer. I need to ensure my counteroffer is better than my outside offer when taking into account the discount factor in later rounds.

This is not greater than 911.\n\n    Let's try again.\n\n    Offer to Player 1: [1, 3, 0, 3, 0]\n    This means I keep:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 62 = 186\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 1 = 3\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 45 = 135\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 77 = 231\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 81 = 243\n    *   Total value to me: 186 + 3 + 135 + 231 + 243 = 798. This is not greater than 911.\n\n    One more try.\n\n    Offer to Player 1: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n    This means I keep:\n    *   4 units of item 1: 4 * 62 = 248\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 1 = 3\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 45 = 135\n    *   6 units of item 4: 6 * 77 = 462\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 81 = 243\n    *   Total value to me: 248 + 3 + 135 + 462 + 243 = 1091.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 51. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 588 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

To maximize my value, the offer should keep my total value significantly above my outside offer of 51, and it should be reasonable enough for Player 2 to consider, taking the discount factor into account.\n\nLet's propose an offer where I give Player 2 a distribution that leaves me a high value:\n\nLet's try to propose:\n- Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1 (valued at 35 per unit)\n- Offer Player 2: 3 units of item 2 (valued at 24 per unit)\n- Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 3 (valued at 77 per unit)\n- Offer Player 2: 3 units of item 4 (valued at 3 per unit)\n- Offer Player 2: 3 units of item 5 (valued at 57 per unit)\n\nThis keeps for myself:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 x 35 = 35\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 x 24 = 48\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 x 77 = 231\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 x 3 = 3\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 x 57 = 171\n\nTotal value = 35 + 48 + 231 + 3 + 171 = 488\n\nThis value is significantly higher than my outside offer of 51.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to make this initial counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 3, 3]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 386.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 82, item 2 = 37, item 3 = 39, item 4 = 78, item 5 = 23.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1 = 7, item 2 = 4, item 3 = 3, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 4.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.

This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 3 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n\n    My value for this offer is:\n    *   4 * 82 + 2 * 37 + 2 * 39 + 2 * 78 + 2 * 23 = 328 + 74 + 78 + 156 + 46 = 682\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 682, which is much better than my outside offer of 386.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** To consider potential counteroffers, I need to think about what Player 1 might accept and whether it's worth the risk of rejection and the discount factor.\n    Offering [0,0,0,0,0] is Mistake 3\n    Offering [7,4,3,4,4] is Mistake 3\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is the first round, the gamma factor doesn't affect the present value for this round.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** \n     - I need to formulate a counteroffer where the total value to me is greater than my outside offer of 888. My objective is also to maximize my value.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   Let's calculate a potential offer where I still receive a higher value than my outside offer.\n\n   - An optimal approach is to offer the other player less valuable items for me while keeping high-value items.\n   \n   - Let's try the following offer to Player 2: [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This means:\n     - I give 2 units of item 1\n     - I keep all units of item 2\n     - I give 1 unit of item 3\n     - I give 1 unit of item 4\n     - I keep all units of item 5\n\n   Now calculate my value if I keep the rest:\n\n   - **Value I receive:**\n     - Item 1: 2 units (100 value each) = 200\n     - Item 2: 3 units (80 value each) = 240\n     - Item 3: 4 units (23 value each) = 92\n     - Item 4: 3 units (76 value each) = 228\n     - Item 5: 2 units (15 value each) = 30\n     - Total Value = 790\n\n   This offer yields a total value of 790, which is less than my outside offer of 888. Therefore, I need to modify this to achieve a higher value than 888.\n\n   Let's adjust the offer, offering [0, 0, 2, 0, 2] to Player 2:\n\n   - **Value I receive with this adjusted offer:**\n     - Item 1: 4 units (100 value each) = 400\n     - Item 2: 3 units (80 value each) = 240\n     - Item 3: 3 units (23 value each) = 69\n     - Item 4: 4 units (76 value each) = 304\n     - Item 5: 0 units = 0\n     - Total Value = 1013\n\n   My adjusted offer provides a total value of 1013, which is greater than my outside offer of 888, and maximizes my value.\n\nBy proposing this offer, I avoid mistakes:\n- Avoiding Mistake 1: The offer improves my position beyond the outside offer.\n- Avoiding Mistake 2: The offer ensures I receive a value greater than my outside offer.\n- Avoiding Mistake 3: The offer neither gives everything away nor hoards all items unnecessarily.\n\nBased on this analysis, my optimal action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 888. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - My outside offer value: 888.\n   - My values per unit for each item: \n     - Item 1: 100\n     - Item 2: 80\n     - Item 3: 23\n     - Item 4: 76\n     - Item 5: 15\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - Item 1: 4\n     - Item 2: 3\n     - Item 3: 5\n     - Item 4: 4\n     - Item 5: 2\n   - Discount factor (gamma) = 0.9, it affects future offers by discounting the potential gain by 10% per round after round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer** from Player 2 ([0, 0, 1, 0, 0]):\n     - My value if I accept: 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 23 = 23 (total value)\n     - 23 is significantly less than my outside offer of 888.\n   \n   - **Previous Offers:**\n     - My previous offer: [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]. The value if accepted could have been calculated, but Player 2 countered.\n     - Player 2's first round offer: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] is the same as current, so still not acceptable.\n\n   - **Alternative Counteroffer Proposals:**\n     - Must value more than 888 but need to critically consider Player 2's valuations and possible acceptance.\n     - Consideration: I need more of high-value items for me (items 1, 2, and 4) while balancing distributions that Player 2 might accept.\n\n3) **Decide What to Do:**\n   - **Accept**: The current offer (value = 23) is much worse than my outside offer (888).\n   - **Walk Away**: My outside offer value is still very attractive and untouched by negotiation dynamics.\n   - **Counteroffer**: Must strive for a higher total value than 888 given the discount factor, keeping valuable items.\n\nAssuming Player 2 may place similar or less value on certain items and based on my valuation, a strategic counteroffer might look like this:\n\n- Current items pool: [4, 3, 5, 4, 2] (I can propose a new offer trying to keep higher value items for myself)\n\nTo aim for a value greater than my outside offer, my proposed counteroffer (what I offer to Player 2) should try to keep more high-value items practical for me and reasonable for them: let's choose an offer and compute the self-value:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n\n**Calculation of Self Benefit**:\n- Keep: \n  - Item 1: 4 (value for me = 4\u00d7100 = 400)\n  - Item 2: 2 (value for me = 2\u00d780 = 160)\n  - Item 3: 2 (value for me = 2\u00d723 = 46)\n  - Item 4: 3 (value for me = 3\u00d776 = 228)\n  - Item 5: 2 (value for me = 2\u00d715 = 30)\n\n- Total value keeping these: 400 + 160 + 46 + 228 + 30 = 864\n\nWhile 864 may appear slightly less than 888, consider the value strategy to form a balance - first ensuring they may accept, while aiming future offers to be closer or above 888. Adjust betting on future rounds and value items I deemed worth lowering another return where practical. \n\nGiven the possibilities, a diversified and balanced acceptable counteroffer can appear to reach a greater negotiation round for better offers considering negotiation maturity.\n\nThus, make the counteroffer. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 622\n*   **My values of the items:** Item 1: 44, Item 2: 20, Item 3: 59, Item 4: 43, Item 5: 84\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 44 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 20 = 20\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 59 = 177\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 43 = 43\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 84 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 0 + 20 + 177 + 43 + 0 = 240\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 240 * 0.9 = 216\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (216) is much less than my outside offer (622). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to ensure that any counteroffer gives me a value greater than 622 * (1/0.9) = 691.11 after accounting for the round 3 discount. Let's consider a counteroffer that gives Player 1 very little. My values for the available items are:\n    * Item 1: 4 units * 44 = 176\n    * Item 2: 3 units * 20 = 60\n    * Item 3: 5 units * 59 = 295\n    * Item 4: 4 units * 43 = 172\n    * Item 5: 2 units * 84 = 168\n    * Total value = 871\n    I need to retain more than 691.11 of value for myself, meaning I have less than 871 - 691.11 = 179.89 of value to offer to Player 1 in this round. To do this, I can try offering the minimum amount of items and see if Player 1 will accept. I will start by offering Player 1 0 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, and 0 of Item 5. I am giving Player 1 20 + (2 * 59) + 43 = 141 worth of items. I will keep 176 + 40 + 177 + 129 + 168 = 690. This round is discounted by a factor of 0.9, so 690 * 0.9 = 621, which isn't better than my outside offer.\n    I can improve the value of my offer to myself by slightly adjusting. If I offer 0 of Item 1, 0 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, and 0 of Item 5. This puts my retained items at a value of 871 - (2 * 59) - 43 = 726. And 726 * 0.9 = 653.4. This offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nBased on my analysis, I should make a counteroffer, offering Player 1 [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]. This ensures I retain a value that is higher than my outside offer after the round 3 discounting.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

Accepting this offer would be a mistake because it is worse than my outside offer.\n\n- **Consider WALK:**\n  As the value of the current adjusted offer (98.82) is much less than my outside offer (888), walking away and taking my outside offer would be a better option.\n\n- **Propose Counteroffer:**\n  In the final round, proposing a counteroffer could be futile unless it significantly exceeds both Player 2's outside offer and any potential future discounted values. Given the current situation, no counteroffer is likely to exceed the value of my outside offer of 888.\n\nGiven this comprehensive assessment, the best course of action is to walk away since no proposed divisions can offer a better value than my guaranteed outside offer.\n\n### Final Decision\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 463. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 463. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 480 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In this first round, there's no discount, so I need an offer with a real value higher than 463.\n\n   To evaluate potential counteroffers, I consider keeping items to maximize my total value above my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 287. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I will aim to keep items with higher value for me and propose giving some items to Player 2, ensuring the value of items I keep is greater than my outside offer (287).\n\n   Let's consider an offer:\n   - Offer the following to Player 2: [2, 1, 3, 2, 0]\n   - Keep for myself: [2, 3, 3, 2, 4]\n\n   Now let's calculate the value of what I keep:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n   - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n\n   Total value = 38 + 210 + 63 + 154 + 400 = 865\n\n   The value of this counteroffer for me is 865, which is substantially higher than my outside offer of 287.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Since my calculated value (865) is much higher than my outside offer, this is an attractive offer for me to propose. I will avoid walking away and make a counteroffer that ensures I keep a significant value.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to propose this counteroffer to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 2, 0]}\n```",

This means that the longer the negotiation takes, the less valuable the final agreement will be, as it's discounted.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Currently, there is no offer on the table. We need to propose an initial offer that maximizes my value while being acceptable to player 2. We need to ensure that the offer I keep for myself has a total value exceeding or at least matching my outside offer (244).\n   - I will calculate my value for various potential divisions of the items and compare these to my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - I will offer Player 2 a portion of items and calculate my retained value to ensure it is at least 244 or better, considering that they might negotiate more favorably if my offer is somewhat reasonable for them too.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. My aim is to retain enough value, and keeping more units of high-value items (at least to me) can be beneficial. \n\nFor starting simplicity, let's see if keeping:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (They receive 3)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (They receive 3)\n- 2 units of item 3 (They receive 3)\n- 3 units of item 4 (They receive 4)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (They receive 1)\n\nThis gives me:\n- Value from item 1: 1 * 14 = 14\n- Value from item 2: 1 * 41 = 41\n- Value from item 3: 2 * 34 = 68\n- Value from item 4: 3 * 66 = 198\n- Value from item 5: 1 * 75 = 75\n\nTotal retained value = 14 + 41 + 68 + 198 + 75 = 396\n\nThe offer to them would be [3, 3, 3, 4, 1].\n\nBy offering them this division, I am left with enough value (396) that is well above my outside option (244). This seems like a strong initial offer and avoids the mistake of zoning too close or below my reservation point of 244.\n\nTherefore, my proposed action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 3, 4, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 603. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 3, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 3, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 603\n   - My values for the items: item 1: 32, item 2: 56, item 3: 51, item 4: 25, item 5: 39\n   - Total items: item 1: 4, item 2: 4, item 3: 5, item 4: 7, item 5: 2\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - The current offer to me is [3, 3, 3, 4, 1]. This means I receive:\n      - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 32 = 96\n      - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 56 = 168\n      - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 51 = 153\n      - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 25 = 100\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 39 = 39\n   - Total value of current offer: 96 + 168 + 153 + 100 + 39 = 556\n\n3) **Compare the value of the current offer to my outside offer:**\n   - The current offer (556) is less than my outside offer (603). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n4) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - I want to find a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept, but which is also better for me than my outside offer.\n   - I have a total value of 860.\n\nLet's try to calculate a fair split. A simple approach would be to aim for an equal division of the total value of the items. 860 / 2 = 430. To reach my outside offer, which is a minimum that I want, is to get a counteroffer that yields me 603 or above.\nI currently hold: item 1: 1, item 2: 1, item 3: 2, item 4: 3, item 5: 1.\nI calculate that the other agent offered to me 556, which is far below the half point mark.\nLet's propose a fairer split.\n\nI will offer Player 1 a division of [2, 2, 2, 3, 1]. This leaves me with:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 32 = 64\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 56 = 112\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 51 = 153\n   - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 25 = 100\n   - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 39 = 39\nTotal Value = 64 + 112 + 153 + 100 + 39 = 468. This is still far below my outside offer value of 603.\n\nLet's try offering them [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]\nThis means I get:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 32 = 96\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 56 = 168\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 51 = 204\n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 * 25 = 125\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 39 = 78\nTotal value = 96 + 168 + 204 + 125 + 78 = 671.\n\nSince 671 > 603, this is a feasible offer.\n\n5) **Decision:**\n   - I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",

If negotiations go to another round without concluding, my payoff from any accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.9. This means the sooner I can achieve a favorable agreement, the better.\n\n2) Assessing the value of potential counteroffers:\n\nConsidering my outside offer value is 280, I want to ensure any counteroffer I propose allows me to keep items with a combined value over 280. Let's evaluate two potential offers and their values to me:\n\n- Offer 1: I keep 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4.\n  - Value to me = (4 \u00d7 67) + (5 \u00d7 17) + (1 \u00d7 43) + (2 \u00d7 65) = 268 + 85 + 43 + 130 = 526\n\n- Offer 2: I keep 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4.\n  - Value to me = (5 \u00d7 67) + (6 \u00d7 17) + (1 \u00d7 43) + (3 \u00d7 65) = 335 + 102 + 43 + 195 = 675\n\nNow let's evaluate offer 2 since it provides more value than my outside offer as well as better than the first calculated offer.\n\n3) Making a decision:\n\nBased on the analysis, I should make an initial counteroffer that allows me to maintain a value greater than 280. Let's propose a division where my value is maximized reasonably in the first round to move toward agreement.\n\n- Offering player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, and 1 unit of item 4.\n  \n  - This leaves me with 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, and 3 units of item 4, which provides a total value of 675, which is greater than my outside offer and avoids mistakes of making a less beneficial offer than the fallback.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 424. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the same deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value of the same deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n    *   Value of the offer:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 6 = 6\n        *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 33 = 66\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 6 = 6\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 71 = 71\n        *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 63 = 0\n        *   Total value: 6 + 66 + 6 + 71 + 0 = 149\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 149 < 424. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer might be. I want to maximize my value while also making it attractive enough for Player 1 to accept. Let's calculate the value if I take everything:\n    *   5 units of item 1 = 5 * 6 = 30\n    *   6 units of item 2 = 6 * 33 = 198\n    *   1 units of item 3 = 1 * 6 = 6\n    *   3 units of item 4 = 3 * 71 = 213\n    *   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 63 = 0\n    *   Total Value = 30 + 198 + 6 + 213 = 447\n    Note that the above are the amounts I would keep if I give the amounts in the current offer. I was incorrect previously when calculating this value.\n    *   Total value of all items is 6*6 + 8*33 + 2*6 + 4*71 = 36 + 264 + 12 + 284 = 596.\n    *   To exceed my outside option I need to obtain a value exceeding 424.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n*   I should not accept the current offer.\n*   I could walk away, but it's early in the negotiation. It's worth making a counteroffer.\n*   I should aim for a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 424.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that aims to split the total value of all items roughly in half, but biased toward me.

I'll propose something where I get around two thirds of the value.\nThe other player proposed giving me a value of 149 out of 596. I will offer something to the player of approximately the same value.\nLet's offer Player 1 [2, 2, 0, 0, 0].

My offer must sum to the totals for each item.\nOkay, let's propose to give the player [2, 3, 1, 2, 0]\nThe value I get keeping [4, 5, 1, 2, 0] is 4 * 6 + 5 * 33 + 1 * 6 + 2 * 71 = 24 + 165 + 6 + 142 = 337\nThat's too low.\n\nLet's propose to give the player [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\nThe value I get keeping [5, 6, 2, 3, 0] is 5 * 6 + 6 * 33 + 2 * 6 + 3 * 71 = 30 + 198 + 12 + 213 = 453\nMy value exceeds my outside value.\nThe value player 1 gets is 1 * 6 + 2 * 33 + 1 * 71 = 6 + 66 + 71 = 143\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 424. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 537 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 424\n    *   My values per unit of each item: item 1: 6, item 2: 33, item 3: 6, item 4: 71, item 5: 63\n    *   Total pool of items: 6 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. Since it is round 2, accepting now means multiplying the value by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 3, 0, 1, 0].  This means I get:\n        *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 6 = 6\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 33 = 99\n        *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 6 = 0\n        *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 71 = 71\n        *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 63 = 0\n        *   Total value = 6 + 99 + 0 + 71 + 0 = 176. Adjusted for discount: 176 * 0.9 = 158.4\n    *   This value is significantly lower than my outside offer of 424.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I *keep* in a counteroffer. My goal is to get at least 424 / 0.9 = 471.11 value for myself *this round*. This is an important threshold to consider. The previous offer I made was [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]. This offer meant that I was keeping [5, 6, 2, 3, 0]. The value to me was:\n         * 5 * 6 + 6 * 33 + 2 * 6 + 3 * 71 + 0 * 63 = 30 + 198 + 12 + 213 = 453.\n         * Discounted this is worth 453 * 0.9 = 407.7.\n         * This is also below my outside offer, so I need to do better than that.\n\n        *   **What about my best possible outcome:** I keep everything [6, 8, 2, 4, 0] - the maximum I can get. 6 * 6 + 8 * 33 + 2 * 6 + 4 * 71 + 0 * 63 = 36 + 264 + 12 + 284 = 596.\n        * Discounted that is worth 596 * 0.9 = 536.4.\n\n3.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    *   The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n    *   I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 471.11 in the current round.\n    * Let's give Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].  This means I keep [6, 7, 2, 4, 0]. The value to me would be:\n        * 6 * 6 + 7 * 33 + 2 * 6 + 4 * 71 + 0 = 36 + 231 + 12 + 284 = 563.\n        * This discounted would be worth 563 * 0.9 = 506.7.\n        * This exceeds my outside offer and gives Player 1 the lowest amount I can get away with.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer to give Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

So, the entire value of the offer is considered at this moment.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer Value:** None (no current offer is on the table).\n   - **Counteroffer Value:** \n     - I need to propose a division where what I keep is more than what I offer to Player 2 and is greater than the outside offer value of 241.\n\n3) **Formulate a Counteroffer Based on Analysis:**\n   - To construct an offer, ensure that the total value of the items I keep is greater than my outside offer value of 241.\n   \n   Calculating each potential item division:\n   - If I keep most valuable items in sufficient quantity to surpass 241.\n   - **Retain:**\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n     - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 85 = 340\n   - Total value = 178 + 82 + 340 = 600\n\n   This value is significantly greater than my outside offer of 241, which implies an optimal decision.\n\n Hence, I will offer the other player the remaining items to maximize my value.\n \n **Offer:**\n   - I will offer Player 2 the following items:\n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 0 unit of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   \nThe proposed offer keeps the highest-value items in sufficient quantity to ensure my total offer value is 600, which efficiently exceeds my outside offer and meets my objectives.\n\nMy action will be to propose this counteroffer to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 4, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 741. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 759 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 4, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 4, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 741.\n   - My values for items 1 through 5 are 15, 63, 90, 22, 63, respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [5, 4, 0, 0, 1]. This means I get 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. The other player gets 0, 0, 2, 1, 4 of items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n      - My value for the current offer:\n         - 5 * 15 (item 1) + 4 * 63 (item 2) + 0 * 90 (item 3) + 0 * 22 (item 4) + 1 * 63 (item 5) = 75 + 252 + 0 + 0 + 63 = 390\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** My value for accepting the current offer (390) is significantly less than my outside offer (741).\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider making a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 741. Since it is round 1, I should try to secure a better offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting it would be a mistake. I will propose a counteroffer. My goal is to get more valuable items while leaving the other player enough to accept the offer. I should aim for a distribution where my total value exceeds my outside offer. I will try to keep all of item 3 and most of items 2 and 5, since these have high values for me.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This would leave me with:\n- 5 item 1: 5 * 15 = 75\n- 4 item 2: 4 * 63 = 252\n- 1 item 3: 1 * 90 = 90\n- 0 item 4: 0 * 22 = 0\n- 5 item 5: 5 * 63 = 315\nTotal Value: 75 + 252 + 90 + 0 + 315 = 732\n\nThis counteroffer is still slightly below my outside offer value. Let's try to keep more of the items.\nI will try to give: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1. That means I keep [5, 4, 1, 0, 5]. This is the same as my earlier calculation with value of 732. It still leaves me with 732, which is below my walkaway.\n\nLet's try offering player 1 only item 1 and item 5. If I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]. Then I have:\n- 5 item 1: 5 * 15 = 75\n- 4 item 2: 4 * 63 = 252\n- 0 item 3: 0 * 90 = 0\n- 0 item 4: 0 * 22 = 0\n- 5 item 5: 5 * 63 = 315\nTotal Value: 75 + 252 + 0 + 0 + 315 = 642\n\nThis is not an adequate counteroffer.\nLet's try offering player 1 [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This leaves me [4, 3, 2, 1, 4]\n- 4 item 1: 4 * 15 = 60\n- 3 item 2: 3 * 63 = 189\n- 2 item 3: 2 * 90 = 180\n- 1 item 4: 1 * 22 = 22\n- 4 item 5: 4 * 63 = 252\nTotal Value: 60 + 189 + 180 + 22 + 252 = 703\n\nLet's offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That is mistake 3 and should be avoided.\nLet's offer [2, 2, 0, 0, 2].\n- 3 item 1: 3 * 15 = 45\n- 2 item 2: 2 * 63 = 126\n- 2 item 3: 2 * 90 = 180\n- 1 item 4: 1 * 22 = 22\n- 3 item 5: 3 * 63 = 189\nTotal Value: 45 + 126 + 180 + 22 + 189 = 562\n\nI need to make sure that my counteroffer leaves me better off than 741. I am going to go ahead and offer player 1 my initial suggestion of giving them all of item 4 and 1 item 3.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Therefore, accepting the current offer results in less value than my outside offer.\n\n3. **Decision Making:**\n   - Accepting this offer would be a mistake, as it provides less value than my outside offer (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away would guarantee me 241, which is more valuable than accepting the current offer.\n   - Therefore, the current offer is not worth accepting, but let's consider crafting a counteroffer that maximizes my value and surpasses the outside offer.\n\n   - **Counteroffer Consideration:**\n     - If I keep all of item 3 (2 units), item 4 (1 unit), and some portion of item 5 to exceed my outside offer, I must ensure I am above the outside value threshold:\n       - Value if I keep:\n         - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n         - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n         - X units of item 5 where 85 \u00d7 X is whatever remaining value needed to cross 241.\n\n       - If instead, let's see how much I can ask as a fair share while maximizing the remaining value:\n         - Keep 3 x item 5 for 3 \u00d7 85 = 255\n\n     - A reasonable counter-offer might be to offer them 1 x item 4 and the remaining of item 5:\n       - [0, 0, 0, 1, 2] offered to Player 2.\n       - Leads to:\n         - 5 units of item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 for me = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255.\n         - 2 units of item 3 and 1 of item 4 stay as valued above (260) which further exceeds 241 as 518 total.\n   \n   - Such a counter-proposal ensures I'm well above my outside offer value and leaves room for negotiation on their part.\n\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 4, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 741\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 15, Item 2: 63, Item 3: 90, Item 4: 22, Item 5: 63\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of its face value compared to round 2.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 0, 0, 1, 2] (This is what Player 1 is offering *me*).\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 15) + (0 * 63) + (0 * 90) + (1 * 22) + (2 * 63) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 22 + 126 = 148\n    *   Since this is round 2, the discounted value of the current offer is 148 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 148 * 0.9 = 133.2\n*   **Compare to outside offer:**\n    *   The discounted value of accepting this offer (133.2) is significantly less than my outside offer (741). Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to ensure that my counteroffer results in a deal where my value exceeds my outside offer of 741. I need to decide how to best allocate the items such that I maximize my own gain.\n    * Let's analyze the value of all items, which is 844.\n\n3) **Making a Decision:**\n\nAccepting the current offer is not a good choice because its discounted value is less than my outside offer. Walking away is also potentially not the best move. Let's explore a potential counteroffer.\n\nPlayer 1's offer in Round 1 was [5, 4, 0, 0, 1], giving them: (5*15)+(4*63)+(0*90)+(0*22)+(1*63) = 75+252+0+0+63 = 390. This leaves me with: (0*15)+(0*63)+(2*90)+(1*22)+(4*63) = 0+0+180+22+252 = 454.\nPlayer 2's offer in Round 1 was [0, 0, 1, 1, 0], giving them: (5*15)+(4*63)+(1*90)+(0*22)+(5*63) = 75+252+90+0+315 = 732. This leaves me with: (0*15)+(0*63)+(1*90)+(0*22)+(0*63) = 90.\nPlayer 1's offer in Round 2 was [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]. This gives me 148. \n\nTo formulate a counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might find acceptable. I should try to offer more items to Player 1 than the current offer while keeping the overall value above 741 for myself.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give player 1 some item 1 and item 2 since they value item 1.\n\nCounteroffer to Player 1: Give Player 1 2 of Item 1 and 2 of Item 2: [2, 2, 0, 0, 0].\nValue to myself: (3*15)+(2*63)+(2*90)+(1*22)+(5*63) = 45+126+180+22+315 = 688. This is still less than 741.\nTherefore, I need to offer fewer items.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nValue to myself: (4*15)+(3*63)+(2*90)+(1*22)+(4*63) = 60+189+180+22+252 = 703\nThis is still not enough. \n\nLet's consider an offer to player 1 of only item 5 of 3 units: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nValue to myself: (5*15)+(4*63)+(2*90)+(1*22)+(2*63) = 75 + 252 + 180 + 22 + 126 = 655\n\nInstead, I will try offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]:\nMy Value = (5*15)+(4*63)+(1*90)+(1*22)+(5*63) = 75+252+90+22+315 = 754\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 4, 3, 3]. This means I receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 95 = 95\n      - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 73 = 0\n      - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 8 = 32\n      - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 33 = 99\n      - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 42 = 126\n      - Total value = 95 + 0 + 32 + 99 + 126 = 352\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (352) is much higher than my outside offer (48).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** It is early in the negotiation so it is very reasonable to make a counteroffer. Since the current offer is generous to me, it makes sense that I ask for more.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, so I shouldn't walk away or accept it without considering a counteroffer. The other player made the first offer very generous to me so I will make a slightly more balanced offer while still keeping an advantage.\n\nLet's calculate my value if I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]. This means I keep:\n   - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 95 = 95\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 73 = 73\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 8 = 24\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 33 = 66\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 42 = 126\n   - Total value = 95 + 73 + 24 + 66 + 126 = 384\n\nSo, I will propose the counteroffer [1, 1, 3, 2, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]}\n```",

Therefore, any counteroffer I make should have a value to me of > 747.\n\n    - Let's consider a counteroffer where I get 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5. The counteroffer to Player 1 would then be [1, 3, 1, 1, 2].\n        - My Value = (3 * 81) + (5 * 68) + (3 * 23) + (3 * 68) + (4 * 87) = 243 + 340 + 69 + 204 + 348 = 1204\n        - This is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n    - Another possible counteroffer could be if I get 4 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 6 of item 5. The counteroffer to Player 1 would then be [0, 2, 0, 0, 0].\n        - My Value = (4 * 81) + (6 * 68) + (4 * 23) + (4 * 68) + (6 * 87) = 324 + 408 + 92 + 272 + 522 = 1618\n        - This would be a significantly better counteroffer than my outside option.\n\n5. **Make a decision:**\n    - Accepting the current offer (631) is worse than my outside offer (747).\n    - Walking away gives me 747.\n    - Proposing the counteroffer [1, 3, 1, 1, 2] gives me a value of 1204.\n    - Proposing the counteroffer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] gives me a value of 1618.\n    - I will propose the counteroffer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] which gives me more value than the other.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Let's consider a significant allocation to myself in a counteroffer:\n\n     - Aim to maximize the value while leaving Player 2 a potential gain, given their possible valuations (unknown to me). I will offer Player 2 fewer of the high-value items for me.\n\n   - Consider a counteroffer such as: [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] which means I keep 3 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\n\n   - Calculate total value for this counteroffer:\n     - For me:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n       - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 76 = 456\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n       - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 61 = 305\n     - Total value to me = 24 + 456 + 150 + 288 + 305 = 1223\n     - Discounted value: 1223 \u00d7 0.9 = 1100.7\n\n   - This is lower than my outside offer as well. Let's retain more of item 2 and item 4:\n\n     - [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], allowing me more:\n\n   **Final counteroffer calculation:**\n\n   - I take [3, 7, 3, 3, 5] for myself.\n     - Total value = 3*8 + 7*76 + 3*50 + 3*96 + 5*61\n     - = 24 + 532 + 150 + 288 + 305 = 1299\n   - Discounted value: 1299 x 0.9 = 1169.1\n\n   - Still lower than my outside offer, but optimally close given iterative adjustments.\n\n   Given the strategic dynamic and potential range errors in adjustments, **walking** may ultimately be optimal past a functional counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the below counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Accepting an offer in a later round reduces its value by this factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]. This means they are giving me:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 55 = 55\n      - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 3 = 6\n      - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 37 = 37\n      - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 14 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 61 = 61\n      - Total value of current offer: 55 + 6 + 37 + 0 + 61 = 159\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (159) is significantly lower than my outside offer (332).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get if I reject the current offer and make a counteroffer. My goal is to secure a deal worth more than 332. Let's consider a few scenarios. First, calculate the maximum I could possibly get if I kept everything:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 55 = 110\n      - 4 units of item 2: 4 * 3 = 12\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 37 = 74\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 14 = 14\n      - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 61 = 183\n      - Total value of keeping everything: 110 + 12 + 74 + 14 + 183 = 393\n\n   I need to get at least 332, and my maximum potential value is 393. It is round 1, and thus there is a discount factor to consider for later rounds.\n\n   Let's consider offering the other player 1 unit of each item: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]. This means that they get\n       - 1 unit of item 1\n       - 2 unit of item 2\n       - 1 unit of item 3\n       - 1 unit of item 4\n       - 2 unit of item 5\n\nThat would leave me with:\n       - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 55 = 55\n       - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 3 = 6\n       - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 37 = 37\n       - 0 unit of item 4: 0 * 14 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 61 = 61\n       - Total value: 55 + 6 + 37 + 0 + 61 = 159\n\nThis counter offer seems similar to what I would get if I accept the current offer, which is below my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give them very little, say: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me a value of 393, which is larger than 332.\nHowever, this is unlikely to be accepted. Let's try to be reasonable, and aim for a value of around 332 for myself.\n\nI need 332. So, I need to offer them such that I retain the difference of (393 - 332) = 61.\nI can take the largest number, 61, which is associated with Item 5. I will try to retain all items of type 5 for myself. Let's offer them only 1 of item 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nIf I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], then I would get:\n       - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 55 = 110\n       - 4 units of item 2: 4 * 3 = 12\n       - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 37 = 74\n       - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 14 = 14\n       - 2 unit of item 5: 2 * 61 = 122\n       - Total value: 110 + 12 + 74 + 14 + 122 = 332\n\nThis exactly hits my outside offer, and it gives the other player a reasonable value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer (159) is much worse than my outside offer (332).\n   - Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] guarantees my outside offer and might be accepted.\n   - It's better to make a counteroffer since it's round 1 and the discount factor is 0.9. I should aim to get something better than my outside offer by making a reasonable counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 332\n   - My values of the items: item 1: 55, item 2: 3, item 3: 37, item 4: 14, item 5: 61\n   - Total pool of items: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. Since it is round 2, any deal now will be discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2.\n      - Value of current offer: (1 * 55) + (1 * 3) = 58.\n      - Discounted value of current offer: 58 * 0.9 = 52.2. This is far worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to consider what I can offer to Player 1 to reach a mutually beneficial deal.\n   - My outside offer: 332.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a discounted value of only 52.2, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 332. Therefore, accepting is not an option. I also want to avoid walking away immediately if there is an offer that is better for me.\n\nNow, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while also making the offer attractive enough for Player 1 to accept. Player 1 currently offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], which means I would keep 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. My value would be (1 * 55) + (3 * 3) + (2 * 37) + (1 * 14) + (3 * 61) = 55 + 9 + 74 + 14 + 183 = 335. This would be 335 * 0.9 = 301.5 in the second round. However, a counteroffer must consider what Player 1 values.\n\nInstead of trying to guess what Player 1 wants, let's focus on getting at least my outside offer.\nA fair division to me would be to try to get as much of items 3 and 5 as possible while leaving Player 1 with items 1, 2, and 4.\nLet's make a counteroffer that guarantees me at least near to my outside offer.\nHow about giving Player 1 [1, 3, 0, 1, 0], meaning I get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nThis would give me (1*55) + (1*3) + (2*37) + (0*14) + (3*61) = 55 + 3 + 74 + 0 + 183 = 315. This value, discounted, is 315 * 0.9 = 283.5. This isn't higher than my outside option, but is quite high.\nHowever, let's attempt to get an amount closer to my outside offer.\n\nHow about I give Player 1 [2, 4, 2, 1, 0], meaning I take all of item 5. My offer would be:\nI keep 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 3 unit of item 5.\nThe value of my counteroffer to me would be: 3 * 61 = 183.\n\nThus, let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]. If Player 1 takes it, my value would be\n(2*55) + (4*3) + (2*37) + (1*14) + (1*61) = 110 + 12 + 74 + 14 + 61 = 271 * 0.9 = 243.9.\nHowever, it is better for me to take the outside offer, because it offers 332.\n\nLet's try giving away only 1 unit of item 1, giving Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nI would get 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nThis offer's value to me is 55 + 12 + 74 + 14 + 183 = 338. This is greater than my outside offer of 332.\nWith the discount rate, it is worth 338 * 0.9 = 304.2, which is still below my outside offer.\n\nSince it is round 2, and any offer has to be discounted, it is unlikely that I can get above my outside offer. I need to make a risky offer. Let me offer a fair amount of items.\n\nLet me give [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]. I receive [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]. \n(1*55) + (2*3) + (1*37) + (1*14) + (2*61) = 55 + 6 + 37 + 14 + 122 = 234.\n234 * 0.9 = 210.6\n\nThe only way to guarantee getting 332 is to WALK.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 18. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 753 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 6, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 6, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for me in this negotiation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 18\n*   My item values: Item 1: 99, Item 2: 71, Item 3: 13, Item 4: 14, Item 5: 54\n*   Total items: Item 1: 6, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting an offer in earlier rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 6, 2, 0, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 99 = 198\n    *   6 units of item 2: 6 * 71 = 426\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 13 = 26\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 14 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 54 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 198 + 426 + 26 + 0 + 0 = 650\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 650 is significantly greater than my outside offer of 18.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider making a counteroffer to try and get an even better deal. Since I have 6 units of Item 1 and Player 1 is offering me 2 units of item 1, I could counteroffer to get more units of Item 1. Similarly, Player 1 is offering me all 6 units of Item 2 and both units of Item 3. Since Player 1 is not offering any units of items 4 and 5, I could propose a counteroffer to receive some units of item 4 and 5.\n\nLet's calculate the value of a possible counteroffer. I'll aim for something that gives me more of the high-value items (1 and 2) and some of the others. Let's consider offering Player 1:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units\n*   Item 2: 0 units\n*   Item 3: 0 units\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 3 units\n\nThis would mean I get:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units, Value: 3 * 99 = 297\n*   Item 2: 6 units, Value: 6 * 71 = 426\n*   Item 3: 2 units, Value: 2 * 13 = 26\n*   Item 4: 1 unit, Value: 1 * 14 = 14\n*   Item 5: 2 unit, Value: 2 * 54 = 108\n*   Total Value: 297 + 426 + 26 + 14 + 108 = 871\n\nAnother possible counteroffer: offer Player 1 all of item 4 and most of Item 5:\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 0 units\n*   Item 3: 0 units\n*   Item 4: 3 units\n*   Item 5: 4 units\n\nThis would mean I get:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 units, Value: 4 * 99 = 396\n*   Item 2: 6 units, Value: 6 * 71 = 426\n*   Item 3: 2 units, Value: 2 * 13 = 26\n*   Item 4: 0 unit, Value: 0 * 14 = 0\n*   Item 5: 1 unit, Value: 1 * 54 = 54\n*   Total Value: 396 + 426 + 26 + 0 + 54 = 902\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 650 is much greater than my outside offer of 18. However, I believe I can get an even better deal. Offering player 1 2 units of item 1, no units of item 2, no units of item 3, all units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5 is a reasonable counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 3, 4]}\n```",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 702\n*   **Values of the items:** item 1: 13, item 2: 99, item 3: 33, item 4: 36, item 5: 81\n*   **Total pool of items:** item 1: 4, item 2: 2, item 3: 7, item 4: 2, item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]. This means I receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 13 = 26\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 99 = 99\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 33 = 99\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 36 = 36\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 81 = 81\n    *   Total value of the current offer: 26 + 99 + 99 + 36 + 81 = 341\n\n    Since 341 < 702, accepting this offer would be worse than my outside offer. Therefore, I should not accept.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer for me.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer. I will try a counteroffer, giving player 1 a significant portion of the items, but ensuring I retain value greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try giving the other player [1, 0, 4, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n* 3 units of item 1: 3 * 13 = 39\n* 2 units of item 2: 2 * 99 = 198\n* 3 units of item 3: 3 * 33 = 99\n* 2 units of item 4: 2 * 36 = 72\n* 2 units of item 5: 2 * 81 = 162\n* Total value = 39 + 198 + 99 + 72 + 162 = 570. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try giving the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n* 4 units of item 1: 4 * 13 = 52\n* 2 units of item 2: 2 * 99 = 198\n* 7 units of item 3: 7 * 33 = 231\n* 2 units of item 4: 2 * 36 = 72\n* 2 units of item 5: 2 * 81 = 162\n* Total value = 52 + 198 + 231 + 72 + 162 = 715. This is greater than my outside offer!\n\nSo, let's give the other player close to nothing while maintaining an amount greater than my outside offer. How about giving the other player [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n* 4 units of item 1: 4 * 13 = 52\n* 2 units of item 2: 2 * 99 = 198\n* 6 units of item 3: 6 * 33 = 198\n* 2 units of item 4: 2 * 36 = 72\n* 2 units of item 5: 2 * 81 = 162\n* Total value = 52 + 198 + 198 + 72 + 162 = 682, and offering the player [0,0,1,0,0]\n\nI think it might be worth trying to propose a counteroffer. The other player started by offering me a certain allocation, which means they want to make a deal. If I give them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], my total value is 715.\n\nHowever, if the negotiation falls apart I can only get 702 from my outside offer. Making a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] might be seen as aggressive and might cause the other player to walk. So I'll modify my offer a bit, giving them [0,0,1,0,0], and my total value is 682, which is less than my outside offer. So I won't do that.\n\nSo let me try to do this carefully. If I offer them [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] then my value would be 715 - 99 = 616, which is less than my outside offer. So I won't do that.\nIf I offer them [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] then my value would be 715 - 13 = 702.\nIf I offer them [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] then my value would be 715 - 13 - 33 = 669.\nIf I offer them [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] then my value would be 715 - 36 = 679.\nIf I offer them [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] then my value would be 715 - 81 = 634.\nIf I offer them [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] then my value would be 715 - 99 - 33 - 36 - 81 = 466.\n\nI will offer them [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Assuming I keep the items with higher value per unit:\n\n- **Proposal 1 (retain more valuable items):** Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1 (I keep 3 units: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204)\n  - 0 units of item 2 (I keep 3 units: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45)\n  - 0 units of item 3 (I keep 0 units: 0)\n  - 1 units of item 4 (I keep 2 units: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10)\n  - 2 units of item 5 (I keep 6 units: 6 \u00d7 99 = 594)\n\n  **Total value I retain:** 204 + 45 + 10 + 594 = 853\n\nThis value is lower than my outside offer, hence it's not suitable. Let's tweak to increase my value:\n\n- **Proposal 2 (slight tweak):** Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1 (I keep 3 units: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204)\n  - 0 units of item 2 (I keep 3 units: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45)\n  - 0 units of item 3 (I keep 0 units: 0)\n  - 2 units of item 4 (I keep 1 units: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5)\n  - 0 units of item 5 (I keep 8 units: 8 \u00d7 99 = 792)\n\n  **Total value I retain:** 204 + 45 + 5 + 792 = 1046\n\nThis offer meets the condition of having a value greater than my outside offer of 898.\n\nGiven all adjustments:\nI will proceed with making this counteroffer as it ensures my retained value exceeds the fallback option and doesn't violate any of the mistake conditions:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

This means accepting an offer later is worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer to me: (0 * 56) + (0 * 35) + (0 * 74) + (2 * 46) + (0 * 55) = 92\n    *   Since 92 < 514, accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a division of items that gives me a value greater than 514.\n\n    *   I have 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 8 units of item 5. My values are 56, 35, 74, 46, and 55 respectively. The total value is (3 * 56) + (3 * 35) + (0 * 74) + (3 * 46) + (8 * 55) = 168 + 105 + 0 + 138 + 440 = 851.\n\n    *   Let's try a counteroffer where I give the other player slightly more, but still retain a value greater than my outside offer. I need to keep at least 514 / 55 = 9.34 units of item 5 in total.\n\n    *   Calculate offer to give away one unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, and 1 unit of item 4, keeping all of item 3 and item 5.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 514\n*   My values per item: item 1: 56, item 2: 35, item 3: 74, item 4: 46, item 5: 55\n*   Total items: item 1: 3, item 2: 3, item 3: 0, item 4: 3, item 5: 8\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. This means that any deal we make now is worth 90% of what it would be worth in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 2, 3]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. My value is:\n    *   (1 * 56) + (0 * 35) + (0 * 74) + (2 * 46) + (3 * 55) = 56 + 0 + 0 + 92 + 165 = 313\n    *   Since we are in round 2, we need to multiply by the discount factor: 313 * 0.9 = 281.7\n    *   This is much less than my outside offer of 514.\n\n*   **Consider the previous round offers:** Round 1 Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0], and I counteroffered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This round's offer from Player 1 is slightly better than their original offer to me, but still poor.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate some counteroffers to see if I can improve my outcome. I need to keep in mind that whatever I offer to Player 1, I keep the remainder. I'll also aim to get at least my outside offer value after applying the discount.\n\n    Let's examine a scenario where I try to secure most of item 5, since I have a good value for it and there are plenty of units. Let's offer Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]. This would mean I get:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 0 - 0 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 2 = 6\n    *   Value to me: (2 * 56) + (2 * 35) + (0 * 74) + (2 * 46) + (6 * 55) = 112 + 70 + 0 + 92 + 330 = 604\n    *   Discounted value: 604 * 0.9 = 543.6. This is greater than my outside offer of 514, so it's a viable option.\n\n    Let's try a more aggressive offer where I ask for more of the items: offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything. The total value of everything to me is:\n    *   (3 * 56) + (3 * 35) + (0 * 74) + (3 * 46) + (8 * 55) = 168 + 105 + 0 + 138 + 440 = 851\n    *   Discounted value: 851 * 0.9 = 765.9. This is my best outcome.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [1, 0, 0, 2, 3] is worth 281.7 to me, which is far less than my outside offer of 514. Accepting would be Mistake 4.\n*   Walking away would give me 514.\n*   Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me a discounted value of 765.9 if accepted.\n\nTherefore, I should propose the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 6]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Therefore, the value of any counteroffer is equal to my outside offer.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer (432) is worse than my outside offer (514).\n*   Walking away gives me my outside offer (514).\n*   Making a counteroffer is essentially walking away, yielding 514.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer now. For example, an offer worth 200 in round 1 is worth 180 in round 2 (200 * 0.9) and 162 in round 3 (200 * 0.9 * 0.9).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 1].

Since my value for item 4 is the highest, I want to retain those, and give more of the others.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer. Accepting it would be a good move.\n*   However, given that this is the first round, I can try to get an even better deal.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of keeping all the items for myself versus the current offer:\n\n*   Keeping everything:\n    *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 34 = 68\n    *   5 units of item 2 = 5 * 49 = 245\n    *   4 units of item 3 = 4 * 6 = 24\n    *   4 units of item 4 = 4 * 73 = 292\n    *   3 units of item 5 = 3 * 1 = 3\n    *   Total value = 68 + 245 + 24 + 292 + 3 = 632\n\nSince I'm getting a better deal than my outside offer by accepting the current offer, I should definitely not walk away. And since it is round 1, I'm going to try to improve my position further.\n\nLet's think about a counteroffer where I ask for almost everything, and give Player 1 only a small amount. Let's offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n\n*   Value to me if I offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1:\n    * I keep 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 34 = 34\n    * I keep 4 units of item 2 = 4 * 49 = 196\n    * I keep 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 6 = 18\n    * I keep 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 73 = 219\n    * I keep 2 units of item 5 = 2 * 1 = 2\n    * Total value = 34 + 196 + 18 + 219 + 2 = 469\n\nThis is much higher than my outside offer, so it would be a good counter offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its undiscounted value.\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]. This means:\n      - 0 units of item 1 * 34 = 0\n      - 0 units of item 2 * 49 = 0\n      - 2 units of item 3 * 6 = 12\n      - 0 units of item 4 * 73 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 5 * 1 = 1\n      - Total value of current offer = 0 + 0 + 12 + 0 + 1 = 13\n      - Discounted value of current offer = 13 * 0.9 = 11.7\n   - **Round 1 offer from P1:** I was offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1 * 34 = 34\n      - 3 unit of item 2 * 49 = 147\n      - 2 unit of item 3 * 6 = 12\n      - 2 unit of item 4 * 73 = 146\n      - 2 unit of item 5 * 1 = 2\n      - Total value of the Round 1 offer = 34 + 147 + 12 + 146 + 2 = 341\n      - Discounted value of the round 1 offer if accepted in round 1 = 341 * 1 = 341\n\n  - **Round 1 offer from P2:** P2 proposed to give [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to player 1. I was willing to give:\n      - 1 unit of item 1 * 34 = 34\n      - 1 unit of item 2 * 49 = 49\n      - 1 unit of item 3 * 6 = 6\n      - 1 unit of item 4 * 73 = 73\n      - 1 unit of item 5 * 1 = 1\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a fair amount and leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer, even after discounting. I need to keep at least 173/0.9 = 192.22 worth of items.\n   - Let's try a counteroffer where I give Player 1 [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]. This leaves me with:\n       - 2 units of item 1 * 34 = 68\n       - 2 units of item 2 * 49 = 98\n       - 4 units of item 3 * 6 = 24\n       - 3 units of item 4 * 73 = 219\n       - 3 units of item 5 * 1 = 3\n       - Total value = 68 + 98 + 24 + 219 + 3 = 412.\n       - Discounted value is 412 * 0.9 = 370.8. This is much better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer (11.7) is significantly worse than my outside offer (173).\n   - Walking away would give me 173.\n   - The round 1 offer was a better option with 341 but is no longer available.\n   - The counteroffer I am considering has a potential discounted value of 370.8 for me, which is much better than walking away or the current offer. Also, the discounted value is better than my outside offer of 173.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

How about I offer [2, 1, 2, 1, 1] to player 1?\n        *   This means I get:\n            *   5 units of item 1 = 5 * 27 = 135\n            *   5 units of item 2 = 5 * 38 = 190\n            *   6 units of item 3 = 6 * 17 = 102\n            *   3 units of item 4 = 3 * 90 = 270\n            *   2 units of item 5 = 2 * 72 = 144\n            *   Total value = 135 + 190 + 102 + 270 + 144 = 841.\n    *   **Scenario 2: Giving a minimal acceptable offer.** I need to ensure player 1 gets at least some value for the deal.\n        *   It is impossible to know Player 1's private value, but I can provide an aggressive counteroffer since there are 3 rounds.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer (298) is better than my outside offer (201), so I shouldn't walk away.\n*   However, I can try to get a better deal since this is only round 1.\n*   Therefore, I will make a counteroffer.

Aim to preserve more value for myself than the outside offer, ideally by computing a distribution that maximizes my payoff.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer which maximizes my utility while keeping the sum of payoffs higher for me as compared to my outside offer:\n\n- Consider keeping more higher value items and providing fractional values of lower influence items:\n  - Proposed counteroffer to the other player: [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\n- Calculate my retained value:\n  - Retaining 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 95 = 570\n  - Retaining 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 63 = 315\n  - Retaining 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 68 = 408\n  - Retaining 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 73 = 292\n  - Retaining 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n  - Total retained value = 1679\n\nSince my retained value of 1679 is greater than my outside offer value of 1137, this counteroffer is feasible and desirable.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 201\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1: 27, Item 2: 38, Item 3: 17, Item 4: 90, Item 5: 72\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 8, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of an offer accepted in round 2, which is worth 90% of an offer accepted in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of Item 1: 1 * 27 = 27\n    *   1 unit of Item 2: 1 * 38 = 38\n    *   2 units of Item 3: 2 * 17 = 34\n    *   0 units of Item 4: 0 * 90 = 0\n    *   1 unit of Item 5: 1 * 72 = 72\n    *   Total value of current offer: 27 + 38 + 34 + 0 + 72 = 171\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer (171) is less than my outside offer (201).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to decide whether to accept the current offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer. Since it is round 2, there is value in making a reasonable counteroffer that could be accepted. The total amount of items are: item 1: 7, item 2: 6, item 3: 8, item 4: 4, item 5: 3.\n\n    I currently have: item 1: 6, item 2: 5, item 3: 6, item 4: 4, item 5: 2 if the current offer is accepted. The values of these is 6*27 + 5*38 + 6*17 + 4*90 + 2*72 = 162 + 190 + 102 + 360 + 144 = 958\n    If I make a counteroffer to keep 3 of item 4, the total will be 3 * 90 = 270. This is greater than the outside offer. I should make a counteroffer that results in this if not already.\n\n    In round 1, I offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 1] and I thought this was reasonable. Therefore, if I still give those values, I will have 5 * 27 + 5 * 38 + 6 * 17 + 3 * 90 + 2 * 72 = 135 + 190 + 102 + 270 + 144 = 841\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is bad compared to my outside offer. If I accept it, I would be making mistake 4.\n\nSince this is round 2, I will make a counteroffer. The counteroffer should give the other player less of the items I value most, particularly item 4. So, I'll offer:\n\n[2, 1, 2, 1, 1] again, the same offer from round 1.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "To determine my action, let's first analyze the current situation and evaluate potential offers:\n\n1) Current Situation:\n   - My outside offer value is: 416\n   - Values of the items (per unit for me):\n     - Item 1: 38\n     - Item 2: 24\n     - Item 3: 62\n     - Item 4: 34\n     - Item 5: 38\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, meaning the longer the negotiation goes, the less valuable the final agreement will become due to the discounting.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Since there is no current offer to accept or reject, I must create an initial offer.\n   - To maximize my value while presenting a reasonable offer, I need to propose a division that gives me more than my outside offer value (416).\n\n3) Making a counteroffer:\n   - If I keep most units with high value to myself and give the minimum possible to Player 2, I can ensure that I maximize my gains.\n   - Let's propose keeping most of the high-value items and ensuring not to take all items or give away all of anything:\n\n   A counteroffer that makes sense while still leaving room to negotiate:\n   - Offer to Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - This means I would keep: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - Calculating the value for myself from this division:\n     - 4 \u00d7 38 (Item 1) = 152\n     - 1 \u00d7 24 (Item 2) = 24\n     - 1 \u00d7 62 (Item 3) = 62\n     - 1 \u00d7 34 (Item 4) = 34\n     - 2 \u00d7 38 (Item 5) = 76\n     - Total value = 348\n\nChecking if this is greater than my outside offer of 416, I find it is not. Hence, I will adjust:\n\nNew Offer:\n   - Offer to Player 2: 5 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - This means I would keep: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - Calculating the value for myself from this division:\n     - 2 \u00d7 38 (Item 1) = 76\n     - 1 \u00d7 24 (Item 2) = 24\n     - 1 \u00d7 62 (Item 3) = 62\n     - 1 \u00d7 34 (Item 4) = 34\n     - 2 \u00d7 38 (Item 5) = 76\n     - Total value = 272\n\nThis offer still gives me less than my outside offer value, but it sets a precedent for negotiation. If I keep more of high-value items for later rounds, I can retain a powerful bargaining position. This offer ensures I'm close to the outside value yet sets the negotiation baseline.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 771\n*   **My item values:** item 1: 63, item 2: 28, item 3: 49, item 4: 29, item 5: 91\n*   **Total items:** item 1: 7, item 2: 1, item 3: 1, item 4: 2, item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [5, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 63 = 315\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 28 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 49 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 29 = 29\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 91 = 91\n    *   Total value of current offer: 315 + 0 + 0 + 29 + 91 = 435\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer (435) is significantly lower than my outside offer (771).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Before making a counteroffer, I should see if there's a division that yields a value greater than 771. I have:\n    *   7 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5. Total value = (7 * 63) + (1 * 28) + (1 * 49) + (2 * 29) + (3 * 91) = 441 + 28 + 49 + 58 + 273 = 849.\n    *   Since the current offer leaves me with only 435, I must counteroffer.\n    *   To figure out a reasonable counteroffer, let's aim for something close to an equal split of the total value, while considering my higher valuation of item 5 and item 1.\n    *   Let's consider giving Player 1 approximately half of the valuable items while keeping the rest for myself.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer (435) is worse than my outside offer (771). Accepting is Mistake 4.\n*   Walking away gives me 771.\n*   I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me at least 771 and isn't worse than my previous (non-existent) offer.\n\nLet's consider the offer where I give Player 1: 2 item 1, 1 item 4, 1 item 5.\nThis would leave me with: 5 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4, 2 item 5.\nMy value: (5 * 63) + (1 * 28) + (1 * 49) + (1 * 29) + (2 * 91) = 315 + 28 + 49 + 29 + 182 = 603.  This is not good enough.\n\nLet's consider the offer where I give Player 1: 1 item 1, 0 item 2, 0 item 3, 0 item 4, 0 item 5.\nThis would leave me with: 6 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 2 item 4, 3 item 5.\nMy value: (6 * 63) + (1 * 28) + (1 * 49) + (2 * 29) + (3 * 91) = 378 + 28 + 49 + 58 + 273 = 786.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) Current Situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 771\n   - Item values: item 1 = 63, item 2 = 28, item 3 = 49, item 4 = 29, item 5 = 91\n   - Total items: 7 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value, while an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: I am offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n     - Value of current offer: (2 * 63) + (0 * 28) + (0 * 49) + (1 * 29) + (0 * 91) = 126 + 0 + 0 + 29 + 0 = 155\n     - Discounted value of current offer: 155 * 0.9 = 139.5. This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 771.\n\n   - Consider keeping all the items and comparing it with outside offer:\n     - I would have 7-2 = 5 units of item 1, 1-0 = 1 unit of item 2, 1-0 = 1 unit of item 3, 2-1 = 1 unit of item 4, 3-0 = 3 units of item 5\n     - Value of keeping those items: (5 * 63) + (1 * 28) + (1 * 49) + (1 * 29) + (3 * 91) = 315 + 28 + 49 + 29 + 273 = 694\n     - The total value of all items is: (7 * 63) + (1 * 28) + (1 * 49) + (2 * 29) + (3 * 91) = 441 + 28 + 49 + 58 + 273 = 849\n\n   - Potential Counteroffers: I need to get at least 771 / 0.9 = 856.67 value to make a counteroffer worthwhile in this round.  Since the total value of all items is only 849, there is no possible division that can get me at least 856.67 in this round.\n\n3) Decision:\n\nSince the current offer's discounted value (139.5) is much lower than my outside offer (771), I should not accept it. Also, there is no counteroffer that I can make that would be worth it.\nThus, my only good option is to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "To make a well-reasoned decision, let's first go through the analysis:\n\n1) **Current situation analysis:**\n   - **My outside offer value:** 866\n   - **Values of the items:**\n     - Item 1: 39 per unit\n     - Item 2: 38 per unit\n     - Item 3: 40 per unit\n     - Item 4: 65 per unit\n     - Item 5: 56 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 9 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor influence:** The discount rate gamma = 0.9 will affect future rounds by decreasing the value received. It incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner rather than later, as my potential payoff decreases by 10% for each subsequent round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   Without a current offer on the table, I must consider a starting offer. For this, I need to propose an offer that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer of 866, considering the other player's likely valuation and need to incentivize them to accept or make a reasonable counteroffer.\n\n   Suppose I consider proposing to keep more valuable items mostly for myself while still ensuring that it is attractive enough for Player 2 to consider, let's say:\n\n   - Let's propose to keep 5 units of item 1 (offer 1 to Player 2), 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. \n\n   - Calculate my received value from this proposal:\n     - Value from item 1: 5 \u00d7 39 = 195\n     - Value from item 2: 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n     - Value from item 3: 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n     - Value from item 4: 5 \u00d7 65 = 325\n     - Value from item 5: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n     - Total value I would retain = 692\n\n   This offer does not exceed my outside offer value of 866, therefore, we need a lower counteroffer.\n\n   Adjust the proposal:\n   - Let's propose to keep 4 units of item 1 (offer 2 to Player 2), 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n   Now calculate:\n   - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n   - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n   - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n   - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 65 = 260\n   - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n   - Total value = 550\n\n   This total value (550) is still less than my outside offer of 866, but let's finalize the division to optimize further keeping the incentive for Player 2 in mind. Attempting a different balance might yield higher results for other potential iterations, but it seems drastically unbalanced expectations are unsuitable.\n\n3) **Decision-making:**\n\nGiven these calculations, I need to balance my offer to ensure it more closely approaches but exceeds 866 without under-incentivizing Player 2. Let's optimize by fine-tuning to maintain rational division principles.\n\nRefine and optimize the proposal as follows:\n- Give 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This retains:\n   - 6 units of item 1 for my high-value\n   - Remaining balance reasonably for any next offer attempt\n\nCalculate retained value:\n- Item 1: 6 \u00d7 39 = 234\n- Item 2: 3 \u00d7 38 = 114\n- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n- Item 4: 5 \u00d7 65 = 325\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n- Total retained value: 769\n\nThus, My offer:\n- {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 4, 1]} is final, as it provides appealing yet careful advance results keeping iterating values approached outside effort.\n  \nDue to inaccuracies, propose refining slightly downward and evaluate next outcomes based on gains.",

                    "response": "To make the best decision based on the negotiation situation, let's go through the analysis thoroughly:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - **My outside offer value**: 866\n   - **Values of the items involved (per unit)**:\n     - Item 1: 39\n     - Item 2: 38\n     - Item 3: 40\n     - Item 4: 65\n     - Item 5: 56\n   - **Total pool of items**:\n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 9 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor**: It multiplies the value of the outcome by 0.9 in this round (Round 2), whereas in Round 1 the factor was 1 (no discount yet applied).\n\n2) **Value Assessment:**\n   - **Current offer on the table**: [3, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n     - My allocation based on the current offer: \n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 40 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n     - Total value = 117 + 38 + 0 + 130 + 56 = 341\n     - Adjusted for the discount factor (0.9), effective value = 341 \u00d7 0.9 = 306.9\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - The effective value of the current offer (306.9) is significantly less than my outside offer (866). Therefore, accepting this offer would result in Mistake 4.\n   - Walking away is an option, but before doing so, we should consider making a counteroffer that maximizes my outcome potentially above the current offer and ensures I am above the outside value in future rounds.\n   - I should ensure I propose an allocation that guarantees a higher value to me than the current table's offer has given me.\n\n   Let's try to propose a counteroffer ensuring that I get at least substantial units of the more valuable items for me, while being reasonable that Player 2 might consider.\n\n   **Proposed Counteroffer**:\n   - Offer Player 2: [2, 0, 0, 4, 1]\n   - This means I keep:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120\n     - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 65 = 325\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n   - My total value = 156 + 114 + 120 + 325 + 112 = 827\n\n   This counteroffer still doesn't quite reach my outside option, but it's an improvement over the previous rounds. Attempting a deal slightly reduces the risk of walking away, and I aim to improve my stance in the final round.\n\nGiven the above plan and calculations, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 4, 1]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 0, 0, 4, 1]. This means Player 1 keeps 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5. The value to me is calculated as follows:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 41 = 82\n      - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 2 = 0\n      - 0 units of item 3: 0 * 87 = 0\n      - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 94 = 376\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 23 = 23\n      - Total value: 82 + 0 + 0 + 376 + 23 = 481\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (481) is less than my outside offer (679).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that give me a value greater than 679. Let's evaluate a few options, keeping in mind that it is Round 2 and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside option. Accepting would be a Mistake 4.\n\nI could walk away, which yields a value of 679.\n\nI need to evaluate if a counteroffer could give me a value higher than 679. Since it's Round 2, my value would be multiplied by 0.9. Therefore, I need a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 679 / 0.9 = 754.44.\n\nLet's look at the previous offer I made. It gave Player 1 [3, 1, 0, 2, 1]. This means I was keeping [3, 2, 3, 7, 2].\nValue of previous offer:\n3 * 41 + 2 * 2 + 3 * 87 + 7 * 94 + 2 * 23 = 123 + 4 + 261 + 658 + 46 = 1092\n\nNow, I need to decide on a reasonable counteroffer. Giving Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 2, 0] looks like it could be beneficial. This means keeping [5, 3, 3, 7, 3].\nValue of proposed deal:\n5 * 41 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 87 + 7 * 94 + 3 * 23 = 205 + 6 + 261 + 658 + 69 = 1199\n\nSince 1199 * 0.9 = 1079.1, which is greater than 679, this offer is much better than walking away. I will send this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 130\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 21, Item 2: 15, Item 3: 81, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 95\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units = 2 * 21 = 42\n    *   Item 2: 2 units = 2 * 15 = 30\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit = 1 * 81 = 81\n    *   Item 4: 2 units = 2 * 1 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 2 units = 2 * 95 = 190\n    *   **Total value = 42 + 30 + 81 + 2 + 190 = 345**\n\n    Since 345 is greater than my outside offer of 130, accepting is a better choice than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would gain from different counteroffers, keeping in mind the other player's possible values and the discount factor. Since I highly value item 3 and 5, I should try to keep most of those. Since player 1 offered me [2, 2, 1, 2, 2], it means they have values for all the items.\n\n    Let's calculate my value if I keep everything for myself, and offer 0 to player 1.\n    * Item 1: 7 * 21 = 147\n    * Item 2: 5 * 15 = 75\n    * Item 3: 4 * 81 = 324\n    * Item 4: 5 * 1 = 5\n    * Item 5: 6 * 95 = 570\n    * Total value = 147 + 75 + 324 + 5 + 570 = 1121\n\n    I will start with a counteroffer to try and get as much as I can. I will offer the other player: [2, 2, 0, 3, 0]\n    This means I keep: [5, 3, 4, 2, 6]. This gives me a value of:\n    * Item 1: 5 * 21 = 105\n    * Item 2: 3 * 15 = 45\n    * Item 3: 4 * 81 = 324\n    * Item 4: 2 * 1 = 2\n    * Item 5: 6 * 95 = 570\n    * Total value = 105 + 45 + 324 + 2 + 570 = 1046\n\n    If they accept my initial offer I will have a value of 1046. This is better than walking away.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of 345 is better than my outside offer of 130. However, I will make a counteroffer as this is round 1, and I can attempt to gain more value.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 130. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 130\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 21, Item 2: 15, Item 3: 81, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 95\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting a deal in round 3 is worth 90% of what it would be worth in round 2, and accepting in round 2 is worth 90% of what it would be in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   2 units of Item 1: 2 * 21 = 42\n    *   2 units of Item 2: 2 * 15 = 30\n    *   0 units of Item 3: 0 * 81 = 0\n    *   2 units of Item 4: 2 * 1 = 2\n    *   0 units of Item 5: 0 * 95 = 0\n    *   Total value: 42 + 30 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 74\n\n    Since 74 < 130 (my outside option), accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Previous round offer from me to P1:** [2, 2, 0, 3, 0]. That means, what I keep is [5, 3, 4, 2, 6]. Therefore,\n    *   5 units of Item 1: 5 * 21 = 105\n    *   3 units of Item 2: 3 * 15 = 45\n    *   4 units of Item 3: 4 * 81 = 324\n    *   2 units of Item 4: 2 * 1 = 2\n    *   6 units of Item 5: 6 * 95 = 570\n    *   Total value: 105 + 45 + 324 + 2 + 570 = 1046\n    The value after the discount would be 1046 * 0.9 = 941.4.\n\n*   **Counteroffer Considerations:** I need to offer Player 1 a deal such that I end up with at least 130 worth of items. Since this is round 2, and the discount factor is 0.9, I want to aim for something that gets me at least 130/0.9 = 144.44 worth of items after giving the offer to Player 1.\n\n    Let's evaluate what it would take to get me to at least 145 if I were to keep certain items, it may be unrealistic to go this low. However, I want to assess how it might look if I were to give up all the remaining items to Player 1.\n    If Player 1 were to get [7, 5, 4, 5, 6], I would be left with nothing.\n\n    What about trying to offer the initial offer again?\n    If Player 1 got the initial offer [2, 2, 1, 2, 2], what do I get? I am left with [5, 3, 3, 3, 4].\n    * 5 units of item 1 = 5 * 21 = 105\n    * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 15 = 45\n    * 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 81 = 243\n    * 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 1 = 3\n    * 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 95 = 380\n    * Total Value = 776\n    And 776*0.9 is equal to 698.4\n\n    Let's consider giving them all of item 4. This would be [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]. This gives me [7, 5, 4, 0, 6].\n    * 7 * 21 = 147\n    * 5 * 15 = 75\n    * 4 * 81 = 324\n    * 0 * 1 = 0\n    * 6 * 95 = 570\n    Total value: 1116\n    1116 * 0.9 = 1004.4.\n\n    If I offer Player 1 [3, 3, 1, 3, 3]\n    I get to keep [4, 2, 3, 2, 3].\n    * 4 * 21 = 84\n    * 2 * 15 = 30\n    * 3 * 81 = 243\n    * 2 * 1 = 2\n    * 3 * 95 = 285\n    * Total = 644\n    And 644 * 0.9 = 579.6\n\n    We are in round 2, and my current offer is [2, 2, 0, 3, 0]. Player 1 has decreased their offer to me from round 1 to round 2. I will try and increase my ask by a little bit.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [2, 2, 0, 2, 0] is worse than my outside offer of 130. I should not accept it. Since we are in round 2, I can make a counteroffer. I will try and increase my ask by a little bit.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]}\n",

This means that if I walk away, I will receive a guaranteed 68 units of value.\n\n2. **Values of the Items**:\n   - Item 1: 13 value per unit\n   - Item 2: 27 value per unit\n   - Item 3: 5 value per unit\n   - Item 4: 48 value per unit\n   - Item 5: 34 value per unit\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items**:\n   - 6 units of item 1\n   - 0 units of item 2\n   - 3 units of item 3\n   - 5 units of item 4\n   - 3 units of item 5\n\n4. **Discount Factor**: As it's round 1, the discount rate \\( \\gamma = 0.9 \\) does not yet influence the immediate value of a round 1 deal (it will affect future rounds).\n\n### Assess the Value of Potential Counteroffers:\n\nSince no current offer is on the table for me to accept, I will consider potential counteroffers where I keep enough value for myself to exceed my outside offer.\n\n#### Example Counteroffer Calculation:\n\nIf I decide to give Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThen I would keep:\n- 4 units of item 1 for myself: \\(4 \\times 13 = 52\\)\n- 0 units of item 2 for myself: \\(0 \\times 27 = 0\\)\n- 2 units of item 3 for myself: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n- 3 units of item 4 for myself: \\(3 \\times 48 = 144\\)\n- 2 units of item 5 for myself: \\(2 \\times 34 = 68\\)\n\nThe total value I receive would be \\(52 + 0 + 10 + 144 + 68 = 274\\).\n\n### Decision:\n\n- My proposed division ensures that I am significantly above my outside offer value of 68.\n- The structure of this counteroffer avoids mistakes such as making an offer worse for me than my outside offer or giving away everything.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will make a counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 2, 1]}\n```\nThis offer aims to maximize my own value while still proposing a fair division of items to Player 2.",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's go through the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** \n  My outside offer value is 527.\n\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 65 per unit\n  - Item 2: 96 per unit\n  - Item 3: 35 per unit\n  - Item 4: 18 per unit\n  - Item 5: 44 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 1 unit of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 4 units of Item 3\n  - 4 units of Item 4\n  - 4 units of Item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:** \n  The discount factor will influence the value of the outcome if this negotiation were to proceed to later rounds. The value will be multiplied by gamma = 0.9 for each additional round delay.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nAs there is no current offer, we generate reasonable offer divisions and calculate their values to see if they exceed the outside offer and maximize the value.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffer\n\nLet's propose an initial offer that ensures the total value I receive is greater than my outside offer.\n\n1. **Counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 3, 3] to Player 2:** \n   - My Units of Item 1: 0 (total value: 0)\n   - My Units of Item 2: 2 (total value: 2 x 96 = 192)\n   - My Units of Item 3: 3 (total value: 3 x 35 = 105)\n   - My Units of Item 4: 1 (total value: 1 x 18 = 18)\n   - My Units of Item 5: 1 (total value: 1 x 44 = 44)\n\n   Total value from this counteroffer for me: 0 + 192 + 105 + 18 + 44 = 359\n\nHowever, this value does not exceed the outside offer. Let's consider another division:\n\n2. **Counteroffer [0, 0, 2, 3, 3] to Player 2:** \n   - My Units of Item 1: 1 (total value: 1 x 65 = 65)\n   - My Units of Item 2: 2 (total value: 2 x 96 = 192)\n   - My Units of Item 3: 2 (total value: 2 x 35 = 70)\n   - My Units of Item 4: 1 (total value: 1 x 18 = 18)\n   - My Units of Item 5: 1 (total value: 1 x 44 = 44)\n\n   Total value from this counteroffer for me: 65 + 192 + 70 + 18 + 44 = 389\n\nNeither of these exceed my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince the calculated counteroffers do not exceed the outside offer, I need to find a better offer that exceeds my outside offer and also fits into a reasonable allocation to begin negotiations:\n\n3. **Counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 2, 2] to Player 2:** \n   - My Units of Item 1: 0 (total value: 0)\n   - My Units of Item 2: 1 (total value: 1 x 96 = 96)\n   - My Units of Item 3: 3 (total value: 3 x 35 = 105)\n   - My Units of Item 4: 2 (total value: 2 x 18 = 36)\n   - My Units of Item 5: 2 (total value: 2 x 44 = 88)\n\n   Total value from this counteroffer for me: 0 + 96 + 105 + 36 + 88 = 325\n\nSo far, none of these counteroffers exceed my outside offer, but I need to feature a decision that has a prospect of negotiation rather than immediate walking away since the discount factor hasn't stepped in yet, later rounds drive additional discoouns.\n\nTherefore, allowing some discussion for negotiation in subsequent rounds (where discounts apply) into consideration, let's try optimize toward not walking immediately.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]}",

This means an offer accepted later is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** I am offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]. This means Player 1 keeps 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 2 of item 5.\n      - My value if I accept: (0 * 31) + (1 * 53) + (2 * 13) + (2 * 97) + (2 * 32) = 0 + 53 + 26 + 194 + 64 = 337.\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 337 < 422. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 some items, but leaves me with enough to exceed my outside offer value of 422.\n   - Let's start by thinking about what would happen if I gave Player 1 nothing. This would be a terrible offer, but let's see the calculation:\n        - I keep [1, 2, 4, 4, 4].\n        - My value: (1 * 31) + (2 * 53) + (4 * 13) + (4 * 97) + (4 * 32) = 31 + 106 + 52 + 388 + 128 = 705\n   - Let's consider other possible counteroffers, with the aim of at least exceeding my outside offer:\n     - Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]: My value = 705.\n     - Offer [1, 2, 4, 4, 4]: My value = 0.\n     - Offer [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]: My value = 337\n   - Let's propose something a little more reasonable to see if it will be accepted later. I want to offer Player 1 a decent amount, but still keep more than 422 in value. Let's try offering half of each item where possible:\n    - Offer Player 1 [0, 1, 2, 2, 2] results in value 337 for me.\n    - Offer Player 1 [1, 0, 2, 2, 2] results in value 106+52+388+128 = 674, so I want to keep item 1 for myself.\n    - Offer Player 1 [0, 0, 2, 2, 2] results in value 31+106+52+388+128 = 705, so I definitely want to keep item 1 for myself.\n\nOkay, it seems I need to keep the most valuable items for myself.

Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 453.\n- **Values of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 66\n  - Item 2: 23\n  - Item 3: 22\n  - Item 4: 75\n  - Item 5: 66\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 5 units of Item 1\n  - 7 units of Item 2\n  - 5 units of Item 3\n  - 2 units of Item 4\n  - 2 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor, gamma, is 0.9. It influences future offers by decreasing their present value, so it's preferable to accept favorable offers earlier rather than later.\n\n### 2. Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: None at the moment.\n- **Assessing Potential Counteroffers**: I should strategically offer a division such that the remaining value to me is greater than 453.\n\n### 3. Proposal of a Counteroffer\n\n#### Calculating Several Possible Counteroffers' Values:\n\n1. **Counteroffer 1: Offer 2 units of each item**\n   - Receive:\n     - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 * 66 = 198\n     - 5 units of Item 2 = 5 * 23 = 115\n     - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 * 22 = 66\n     - 0 units of Item 4 = 0 * 75 = 0\n     - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 * 66 = 0\n   - Total value = 198 + 115 + 66 = 379\n\n2. **Counteroffer 2: Offer 3 units of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3**\n   - Receive:\n     - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 * 66 = 132\n     - 6 units of Item 2 = 6 * 23 = 138\n     - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 * 22 = 66\n     - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 * 75 = 150\n     - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 * 66 = 132\n   - Total value = 132 + 138 + 66 + 150 + 132 = 618\n\n   Since Counteroffer 2 results in my total value being significantly higher than my outside offer value of 453, it is a valid counteroffer. It also avoids making any of the five negotiation mistakes, as it provides value above the outside offer and does not heavily favor Player 2.\n\n### Conclusion and Action\nUsing the logic above, I should make a counteroffer ensuring I retain values above my fallback option (outside offer value). Counteroffer 2 is optimal at this stage.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

My value is 125.\nI want to make an offer that gives me more than 125 (before discounting), but also that Player 1 might accept.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 [2, 5, 3, 1, 1]. This would leave me with [3, 2, 2, 1, 1], which I value as:\n(3 * 1) + (2 * 94) + (2 * 14) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 30) = 3 + 188 + 28 + 57 + 30 = 306\nThis is a significantly larger value than my outside offer, and potentially gives Player 1 a reasonable deal.\n\nNow compare the potential counteroffer to accepting.

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means they are offering me all 3 units of item 1 and nothing of the other items.  My value if I accept:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 4 = 12\n    *   Total Value: 12\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 12 < 677. Accepting the current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I could offer Player 1 that would leave me with a value greater than 677. I also need to consider that this is round 1, and there are two rounds left, so the discount factor isn't too severe yet.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, I should not accept. I also should not walk away immediately, since this is only round 1 and I have an opportunity to make a counteroffer. Let's try to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside option and also reasonable enough that the other player will consider it.\n\nHere's a possible approach: aim to get most of the high-value items (items 4 and 5). I'll make a counteroffer that gives the other player all of items 1, 2 and 3, and see if they accept.\n\n*   Offer: [0, 7, 9, 0, 0]\n*   My remaining items:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 7 - 7 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 9 - 9 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3\n*   My value: (3 * 4) + (0 * 42) + (0 * 36) + (2 * 96) + (3 * 57) = 12 + 0 + 0 + 192 + 171 = 375\n\nThis is not good enough.

This means that any deal we make in this round (round 2) will be worth 0.9 times its actual value to me.\n\n2)  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 3, 6, 0, 0]. This means I would get:\n        *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 4 = 0\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 42 = 126\n        *   6 units of item 3: 6 * 36 = 216\n        *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 96 = 0\n        *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 57 = 0\n        *   Total value: 0 + 126 + 216 + 0 + 0 = 342\n        *   Discounted value: 342 * 0.9 = 307.8\n\n    *   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of accepting the current offer (307.8) is less than my outside offer (677). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I could offer Player 1 that would be acceptable to them but still give me a value greater than my outside offer *after discounting*.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 6, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my best action, I will follow the step-by-step process outlined.\n\n1) First, analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1544.\n   - My private values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 17\n     - Item 2: 92\n     - Item 3: 59\n     - Item 4: 88\n     - Item 5: 90\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 7 units of item 2\n     - 9 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor applies less as we are in the final round since gamma = 0.9 and this is Round 3, so there is one power applied: \\(0.9^{\\text{(3-1)}} = 0.81\\).\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer and potential counteroffers:\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I would get:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n     - 7 units of item 2 = 7 \u00d7 92 = 644\n     - 9 units of item 3 = 9 \u00d7 59 = 531\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 88 = 88\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n\n     Total value if I accept it = 51 + 644 + 531 + 88 + 270 = 1584\n     Adjusted by discount factor (0.81): \\(1584 \\times 0.81 = 1283.04\\).\n\n   - Potential counteroffers must yield a value greater than my outside offer of 1544 to be acceptable. However, with the adjustment factor, the maximum gain in this last round would be less due to the adjusted value, which drops below the outside offer level at 1283.04.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I cannot accept the current offer because 1283.04 is less than my outside offer (mistake 4).\n   - Since there is no deal beneficial enough given the discount for the final round, I should walk away and secure my private outside offer of 1544 instead of risking a worse settlement.\n   - Any counteroffer that would make sense would still need to beat the adjusted threshold, which given the limit of how many items I can meaningfully counteroffer with, seems less viable.\n\nGiven these considerations, my best action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 630.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1: 38, item 2: 57, item 3: 29, item 4: 46, item 5: 20.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1: 4, item 2: 6, item 3: 4, item 4: 5, item 5: 4.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 3 will be worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 1, 3, 1]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    *   Value of this offer: (1 * 38) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 29) + (3 * 46) + (1 * 20) = 38 + 114 + 29 + 138 + 20 = 339.\n    *   Since this is round 2, accepting this offer now yields a value of 339 * 0.9 = 305.1.\n    *   Since 305.1 < 630, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n*   **Previous Offer:** The previous offer made by player 1 was [1, 2, 1, 2, 1].\n    *   The value of that offer to me was (1 * 38) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 29) + (2 * 46) + (1 * 20) = 38 + 114 + 29 + 92 + 20 = 293.\n    *   Since this was round 1, accepting that offer then would have yielded a value of 293 * 0.9^0 = 293.\n    *   Since 293 < 630, accepting the previous offer would have been worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:**\n    Let's consider a scenario where I make Player 1 a \"fairer\" offer, keeping a significant portion of the items for myself. Remember, the items I keep are:\n    * item 1: 38\n    * item 2: 57\n    * item 3: 29\n    * item 4: 46\n    * item 5: 20\n    I want my offer to be worth more than 630 / 0.9 = 700 to accept it in round 3.\n\n    To get an idea, let's consider the case where I keep half of each item (rounded up or down) and offer the rest to Player 1. This would be keeping [2, 3, 2, 3, 2] for myself.\n    Value to me: (2 * 38) + (3 * 57) + (2 * 29) + (3 * 46) + (2 * 20) = 76 + 171 + 58 + 138 + 40 = 483.\n    This is much less than my outside offer. Let's try to increase the value to me.\n\n    If I propose to give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], that means I am keeping everything.\n    My value = (4 * 38) + (6 * 57) + (4 * 29) + (5 * 46) + (4 * 20) = 152 + 342 + 116 + 230 + 80 = 920.\n    Since this is round 2, that means a value of 920 * 0.9 = 828.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 305.1 to me after discounting, which is less than my outside offer of 630. Therefore, I shouldn't accept it. (Mistake 4)\n*   Walking away guarantees me 630.\n*   A counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would give me a value of 828.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer of keeping all items.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means a delay in reaching an agreement reduces the effective value of any potential agreement by a factor in subsequent rounds.\n\nNext, let's devise a reasonable opening offer to maximize my outcome.\n\n### Offer Value Calculation:\n\nI'm aiming for an offer that gives me a total value above my outside offer (1004), adjusting for the discount in future rounds. I'll test some possible scenarios:\n\n- **Proposal to Player 2 (High-value items kept by me)**:\n  - Player 2: [0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5]\n  - This means I keep: [5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5]\n\n#### My retained value:\n- Item 1: 5 \u00d7 72 = 360\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 47 = 188\n- Item 3: 6 \u00d7 1 = 6\n- Item 4: 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 94 = 376\n\nTotal Value = 360 + 188 + 6 + 264 + 376 = 1194\n\nThis offer gives me a value of 1194, which is above my outside offer of 1004. This seems like a strong opening offer. It ensures that I'm not making any of the listed mistakes, as I'm securing a value higher than my fallback position, and I'm not making a suboptimal offer.\n\n### Decision:\nBased on these calculations, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 344\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 46, Item 2: 97, Item 3: 65, Item 4: 68, Item 5: 42\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 9, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n    *   0 * 46 + 1 * 97 + 3 * 65 + 0 * 68 + 0 * 42 = 0 + 97 + 195 + 0 + 0 = 292\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (292) is less than my outside offer (344).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to maximize my value, but I also need to give Player 1 enough to accept. I have 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Let's consider making a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 most of item 1 and item 4, keeping item 2 and item 3, and item 5 for myself. For example, I could offer [4, 0, 1, 3, 0]. This means I keep 1 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and all 4 of item 5. My value would be:\n    *   1 * 46 + 5 * 97 + 8 * 65 + 1 * 68 + 4 * 42 = 46 + 485 + 520 + 68 + 168 = 1287\n    This would be better than my outside offer.\n    However, I want a better initial offer so I don't have to give up too much value. Let's consider an offer of [2, 0, 2, 1, 0] which means I get to keep 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n    This value would be: 3 * 46 + 5 * 97 + 7 * 65 + 3 * 68 + 4 * 42 = 138 + 485 + 455 + 204 + 168 = 1450\n    This seems like a good starting point.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept.\n*   I should not walk away immediately, as I can potentially get a better deal.\n*   I should make a counteroffer.\n\nBased on the above, my action is to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1165\n*   My values for items: item 1: 89, item 2: 74, item 3: 17, item 4: 39, item 5: 71\n*   Total pool of items: item 1: 4, item 2: 5, item 3: 3, item 4: 4, item 5: 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 3, 1, 2, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n\n    Value of current offer to me:\n    *   Item 1: 2 * 89 = 178\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 74 = 148\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 17 = 34\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 39 = 78\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 71 = 142\n    *   Total value: 178 + 148 + 34 + 78 + 142 = 580\n\n    580 < 1165, so accepting this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that gives Player 1 some items while leaving me with enough to exceed my outside offer. It is round 1 so the full value is applicable. I will start by figuring out what distribution of the available items would get me at or above my 1165 outside offer.\n\n    Let's say I keep all of item 1 and item 2 (4 * 89 + 5 * 74 = 356 + 370 = 726) and all of item 5( 4 * 71 = 284).  Now my value is 726 + 284 = 1010. I need 155 more. I will try to achieve that with item 4. 155/39 = 3.97 so, if I keep all 4 of item 4 I will do better than my outside offer. I can do better than that even and give some back.\n    4 * 39 = 156. This means I need to give player 1 none of the items. \n    Let's try keeping 4 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 4 of item 5:\n    4*89 + 5*74 + 0*17 + 4*39 + 4*71 = 356 + 370 + 0 + 156 + 284 = 1166\n    So I need to give player 1 = [0,0,3,0,0]\n\n    If the other player is rational they should accept this offer as they currently get 580 from my acceptance of their offer, and I am asking them to accept something above that.\n    \n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer. Therefore, I should not accept it. Making a counteroffer is better than walking away as there may be a deal to be made.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 1165.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 89, item 2 = 74, item 3 = 17, item 4 = 39, item 5 = 71.\n*   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 2, 3, 2, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   1 units of item 5\n    My value for this offer is: (2 * 89) + (2 * 74) + (3 * 17) + (2 * 39) + (1 * 71) = 178 + 148 + 51 + 78 + 71 = 526\n    Considering the discount factor of 0.9, the present value is 526 * 0.9 = 473.4.\n*   **Outside offer vs Current Offer:** My outside offer is 1165. The discounted value of accepting the current offer is 473.4. Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   **Previous Round:** In round 1, I offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] to Player 1. This means I wanted:\n    *   4 units of item 1\n    *   5 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   4 units of item 4\n    *   4 units of item 5\n    My value would have been: (4 * 89) + (5 * 74) + (0 * 17) + (4 * 39) + (4 * 71) = 356 + 370 + 0 + 156 + 284 = 1166\n    The discounted value would have been: 1166 * 0.9^(1-1) = 1166\n    This means I would have been negligibly better off with the items I wanted in round 1 compared to my outside offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I can offer Player 1 to get a deal that's better than my outside offer. Since Player 1 offered [2, 2, 3, 2, 1] to me, they are keeping:\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n    I want to get closer to my outside offer of 1165, after considering the discount.\n    If I propose to give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], that means I will receive\n        *   4 units of item 1\n        *   5 units of item 2\n        *   3 units of item 3\n        *   4 units of item 4\n        *   4 units of item 5\n        My value will be: (4 * 89) + (5 * 74) + (3 * 17) + (4 * 39) + (4 * 71) = 356 + 370 + 51 + 156 + 284 = 1217. This discounted is 1217 * 0.9 = 1095.3.\n    This is lower than my outside offer.\n\n    I need to find an allocation such that the discounted value to me is greater than 1165.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nAccepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer. I cannot accept.\nI want to figure out how to counter-offer. Round 3 is the last round.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 the following:\n* 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\nIn that case I would receive:\n* 3 unit of item 1, 4 unit of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, 3 unit of item 5\nMy value would be: (3 * 89) + (4 * 74) + (2 * 17) + (3 * 39) + (3 * 71) = 267 + 296 + 34 + 117 + 213 = 927\nThe discounted value would be: 927 * 0.9 = 834.3. This is less than my outside offer.\n\nGiven the discount factor and that we're in round 2, it's unlikely I'll get a deal better than my outside offer.\nMy best course of action is to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 997\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 33, Item 2: 34, Item 3: 21, Item 4: 99, Item 5: 9\n*   **Total item pool:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 9, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now. For example, an offer worth 100 in round 1 is worth 90 in round 2 (100 * 0.9) and 81 in round 3 (100 * 0.9 * 0.9).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer (to me):** [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 33 = 33\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 34 = 34\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 21 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 99 = 99\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 9 = 9\n    *   Total value = 33 + 34 + 0 + 99 + 9 = 175\n*   **Value of current offer after discount:** Round 1, so the discount is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. Thus, the current offer is worth 175 * 1 = 175\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 175 < 997. Accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider a possible counteroffer. I want to keep as much of item 4 as possible, since that has the highest value. Since Player 1 offered me one unit of item 4, it suggests they also value it highly. Let's try to make a counteroffer that is closer to my outside option.\n\n*   Keep: item1: 3, item2: 3, item3: 0, item4: 8, item5: 1\n*   Offer: item1: 2, item2: 2, item3: 0, item4: 1, item5: 1\n*   My total value for this scenario is: 3*33 + 3*34 + 0 + 8*99 + 1*9 = 99 + 102 + 0 + 792 + 9 = 1002\n\nThis offer results in a value of 1002, which is greater than my outside offer of 997. It avoids mistakes 2 and 4.\nIt's better to make an offer than to accept a bad offer or walk away.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI should make a counteroffer. I'll offer Player 1 [2, 2, 0, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Clearly, this is worse than my outside offer and is unacceptable.\n   \n   - **Value of my round 1 offer [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]:**\n     - My items: [3, 3, 3, 2, 4]\n     - Value = 3*25 + 3*98 + 3*22 + 2*14 + 4*47 = 75 + 294 + 66 + 28 + 188 = 651\n     - Discounted value = 651 * 0.9 = 585.9, which is just below my outside offer (597).

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 597. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 618 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 5, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 5, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Before making a decision, let's analyze the current situation and evaluate the options:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 597.\n   - Values of the items involved:\n     - Item 1: 25 \n     - Item 2: 98\n     - Item 3: 22\n     - Item 4: 14\n     - Item 5: 47\n   - Total pool of items: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor gamma = 0.9. In round 3, no further discount is applied since this is the last round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [0, 3, 5, 0, 0] means I receive 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n     - Value calculation:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 25 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n       - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 22 = 110\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 47 = 0\n     - Total value = 0 + 294 + 110 + 0 + 0 = 404\n\n   - Compare this total value (404) to my outside offer value (597).\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer, making it undesirable to accept.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since accepting the current offer gives me a value of 404, which is less than my outside offer of 597, accepting would be an unacceptable mistake (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away guarantees me a value of 597, which is better than the current offer.\n   - Counteroffering is pointless at this stage since it is round 3 and any counteroffer will be treated as walking away.\n\nThus, the logical action is to:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

The current offer gives me 65.7, which is less than my outside offer.\n\nSince the current offer is less valuable to me than my outside offer, I should not accept it. \n\nNext step would be to assess potential counteroffers that are better than my outside offer. \n\n- **Potential Counteroffer ([0, 0, 0, 1, 0]):**\n  - I receive:\n    - 2 units of item 1: \\( 2 \\times 66 = 132 \\)\n    - 2 units of item 2: \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\)\n    - 3 units of item 3: \\( 3 \\times 37 = 111 \\)\n    - 2 units of item 4: \\( 2 \\times 23 = 46 \\)\n    - 2 units of item 5: \\( 2 \\times 29 = 58 \\)\n  - Value after giving away 1 unit of item 4:\n    - Total value before discount: \\( 132 + 4 + 111 + 46 + 58 = 351 \\)\n    - Total value after discount: \\( 351 \\times 0.9 = 315.9 \\)\n\nThis counteroffer would give me 315.9, which is much more than my outside offer (119), so it would be beneficial. \n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that the current offer values at 65.7 for me, which is significantly below my outside offer of 119, I should neither accept the current offer nor walk away. Instead, I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a higher value than the outside offer and is reasonable.\n\n**Action:** \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Hence, I will need to make an initial offer or decide to walk away.\n\nTo create advantageous offers, I'll consider offers that provide me with a value greater than my outside offer of 334.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\n\nLet's explore a possible division where I try to maximize my value.\n\n- **Offer to Player 2:**\n  - 2 units of Item 1 (keeping 3)\n  - 0 units of Item 2 (as none are available)\n  - 3 units of Item 3 (keeping 5)\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 (keeping 2)\n  - 0 units of Item 5 (keeping 2)\n\n**My Value from This Offer Arrangement:**\n- 3 units of Item 1: \\(3 \\times 86 = 258\\)\n- 5 units of Item 3: \\(5 \\times 53 = 265\\)\n- 2 units of Item 4: \\(2 \\times 21 = 42\\)\n- 2 units of Item 5: \\(2 \\times 68 = 136\\)\n\n**Total Value for Me:** \\(258 + 265 + 42 + 136 = 701\\)\n\n### 3. Make a Decision:\n\n- The potential offer results in a value of 701 for me, which is much better than the outside offer of 334.\n\nGiven these calculations and my goals, I will make the following initial offer to Player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]}\n```\n\nThis offer ensures I retain a high value outcome with 701, well above my outside offer.",

In subsequent rounds, the value I receive from any deal will be discounted. Therefore, securing a favorable deal early on is advantageous unless it's not beneficial compared to my outside offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**:\n   - There is no current offer on the table since this is the first move.\n   - I need to propose an initial offer. To maximize my value, my proposal should ensure I receive more than my outside offer value, **558**.\n   \n   Here's the calculation for potential counteroffers:\n   - Full possession value:\n     ```\n     Total value = 6 * 65 + 6 * 26 + 6 * 7 + 2 * 52 + 2 * 35 = 390 + 156 + 42 + 104 + 70 = 762\n     ```\n   - My goal is to retain a portion worth more than 558. \n\n3) **Constructing a strategic offer**:\n   - Suppose I propose keeping most items that have higher value to me. Let's consider:\n     - Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5\n     - Calculation of the retained value:\n       ```\n       Retained value = 6*65 + 5*26 + 2*7 + 1*52 + 1*35\n                     = 390 + 130 + 14 + 52 + 35\n                     = 621\n       ```\n   - This offer provides me with a retained value of 621, which is greater than my outside offer value of 558.\n\nBy ensuring I maintain a high enough value, I avoid mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer).\n\nThus, my action is to make a counteroffer with the proposed division:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 4, 1, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 147.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 76, item 2 = 100, item 3 = 67, item 4 = 46, item 5 = 98.\n   - The total pool of items is: 6 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 4, 1, 1]. This means they keep:\n     - Item 1: 6 - 0 = 6\n     - Item 2: 6 - 1 = 5\n     - Item 3: 6 - 4 = 2\n     - Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1\n\n   - **Value of current offer to me:**\n     - 0 units of item 1: 0 * 76 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 100 = 100\n     - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 67 = 268\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 46 = 46\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 98 = 98\n     - Total value: 0 + 100 + 268 + 46 + 98 = 512\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (512) is significantly better than my outside offer (147).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I want to maximize my value while considering the discount factor. It's round 1, so there's no discount yet. I should aim for an offer that is significantly better than 147.\n     - I currently get [0, 1, 4, 1, 1]. I keep [6, 5, 2, 1, 1]. Value = 512\n     - Consider offering half each: [3,3,3,1,1].\n     - I keep [3,3,3,1,1]. Value = 3*76 + 3*100 + 3*67 + 1*46 + 1*98 = 228+300+201+46+98 = 873. \n     - Is this realistic? I need to consider what P1 wants as well.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is better than walking away (512 > 147).\n   - However, I believe I can get a better deal. I need to craft a counteroffer that gives Player 1 enough to stay in the game, while still significantly improving my position.\n\nI think asking for half is too greedy, and may be rejected. Let me try a more conservative offer where I give player 1 [2, 2, 3, 1, 1].\n\nThen I would receive [4, 4, 3, 1, 1].\nValue = 4 * 76 + 4 * 100 + 3 * 67 + 1 * 46 + 1 * 98 = 304 + 400 + 201 + 46 + 98 = 1049.\n\nThis looks promising.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since it is round 2, any accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.9. Therefore, my target discounted value needs to be higher than 147, meaning I should aim for a value greater than ~163.33 (147 / 0.9).\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (657) is significantly better than my outside offer (147).\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, even after considering the discount factor. Therefore, accepting would be a good choice.\n\n   Based on this analysis, I should ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n",

My goal is to offer a counteroffer with a total value to me greater than 1112.\n\n   - Example counteroffer to Player 2:\n     - Give 0 units of item 1\n     - Give 1 unit of item 2\n     - Give 1 unit of item 3\n     - Give 2 units of item 4\n     - Give 4 units of item 5\n   \n   My retained value:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n   - 4 units of item 2 = (5 - 1) \u00d7 89 = 356\n   - 2 units of item 3 = (3 - 1) \u00d7 26 = 52\n   - 2 units of item 4 = (4 - 2) \u00d7 55 = 110\n   - 2 units of item 5 = (6 - 4) \u00d7 18 = 36\n\n   Total retained value = 264 + 356 + 52 + 110 + 36 = 818\n\n   The proposed counteroffer has a value of significantly less than 1112, indicating I need to revise my proposal to get closer to my fallback value. Let's use another strategy:\n\n   - Give 0 units of item 1\n   - Give 1 unit of item 2\n   - Give 1 unit of item 3\n   - Give 2 units of item 4\n   - Give 3 units of item 5\n\n   Total retained value:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n   - 4 units of item 2 = (5 - 1) \u00d7 89 = 356\n   - 2 units of item 3 = (3 - 1) \u00d7 26 = 52\n   - 2 units of item 4 = (4 - 2) \u00d7 55 = 110\n   - 3 units of item 5 = (6 - 3) \u00d7 18 = 54\n\n   Total retained value = 264 + 356 + 52 + 110 + 54 = 836\n\nThe value is still lower than my fallback, but as an initial offer, it might influence Player 2 to give a favorable counter. However, there isn\u2019t an immediate offer providing a sufficiently high value. I'll attempt to approach my fallback by offering Player 2 less valuable items with a potential fair division.\n\n   I've noticed my calculated values aren't meeting the fallback level of 1112 due to the cap on the number of units available. Thus, I'll propose a low-value first round offer to see if the dynamics give me room for negotiation in the next round.\n\n   - **Counteroffer Proposal**: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (testing if negotiations may consider a low-impact starting point without missing an opportunity)\n\nGiven the situation, a reasonable step is to propose an offer that's balanced as such. But considering that our actual direction may need refining until exceeding fallback, the low-space initial offer definition from above may shift through rounds. Since it\u2019s purely hypothetical, I'll utilize safe lower order here:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 4.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 54, item 2 = 28, item 3 = 99, item 4 = 18, item 5 = 28.\n   - The total pool of items is: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 3, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 6.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - The current offer to me is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]. This means I receive:\n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The value of this offer to me is: (0 * 54) + (1 * 28) + (1 * 99) + (2 * 18) + (3 * 28) = 0 + 28 + 99 + 36 + 84 = 247.\n   - 247 > 4. Therefore, accepting the offer is better than walking away *if* it were a final offer. However, since this is round 1, it makes sense to try to get an offer that is even better.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - I need to decide what to offer Player 1. Let's consider the remaining items.\n     - I have the following items: [4, 4, 2, 2, 3]. The value to me of keeping those items is (4*54) + (4*28) + (2*99) + (2*18) + (3*28) = 216 + 112 + 198 + 36 + 84 = 646.\n\nSince it is round 1, I can make a counteroffer. I will start by offering a \"fair\" split, giving the other player a bit less than half of the total value to me. If the total value is 893, half would be 446.5. I'll offer a division that is slightly worse than a 50/50 split. This way, I can try to gain advantage, but I am not being too greedy in the first round. Let me consider the average value per item type:\n\nItem 1 average value: 54 + Player1_Item1_Value. The total quantity is 4\nItem 2 average value: 28 + Player1_Item2_Value. The total quantity is 5\nItem 3 average value: 99 + Player1_Item3_Value. The total quantity is 3\nItem 4 average value: 18 + Player1_Item4_Value. The total quantity is 4\nItem 5 average value: 28 + Player1_Item5_Value. The total quantity is 6\n\nI will attempt to propose the other player a division close to [2,2,1,2,3], leaving [2,3,2,2,3] to me.\n\nThe value to me would be (2*54) + (3*28) + (2*99) + (2*18) + (3*28) = 108 + 84 + 198 + 36 + 84 = 510\n\nOkay, a better offer than that would be to offer Player 1 a division slightly better than the one I received.\n\n4) **Final Decision:**\n   - The current offer of [0, 1, 1, 2, 3] gives me a value of 247, which is much better than my outside option of 4.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means any deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 5, 3, 2, 0] which means I get 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n   - Value of current offer: (0 * 73) + (5 * 26) + (3 * 68) + (2 * 74) + (0 * 84) = 0 + 130 + 204 + 148 + 0 = 482\n   - Discounted value of current offer: 482 * 0.9 = 433.8\n   - My outside offer is 779, so the discounted value of the current offer (433.8) is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n   - Player 1 offered me [0, 5, 3, 2, 0]. This means player 1 keeps [2, 0, 0, 3, 3]. Let's consider what I offered in Round 1, I offered Player 1 [1, 3, 0, 2, 0].\n   - If I were to take my outside offer, my value would be 779.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 433.8, which is much lower than my outside offer of 779.\n   - Walking away gives me 779.\n   - I need to formulate a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, considering the discount factor.\n   - I currently have 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5.\n   - My value would be (2 * 73) + (0 * 26) + (0 * 68) + (3 * 74) + (3 * 84) = 146 + 0 + 0 + 222 + 252 = 620. Then, I would need to multiply this value by 0.9 to account for the discount factor of this round, 620 * 0.9 = 558.\n   - I need to ask for more items to achieve a better offer, that has a total value for me above 779/0.9= 865.5\n   - Let's try to keep all of item 5 (3 units = 252 value), then the value left to reach: 865.5 - 252 = 613.5\n   - Lets also keep all of item 4 (5 units) = 370 value, the value remaining to reach is: 613.5 - 370 = 243.5\n   - Lets try keeping all of item 1 (2 units) = 146 value, the value remaining to reach is: 243.5 - 146 = 97.5\n   - I can offer 5 of item 2, and 3 of item 3.\n\n   - Proposed counteroffer: I offer [0, 5, 3, 0, 0] to Player 1, therefore keeping [2, 0, 0, 5, 3] for myself.\n   - My value from this offer: (2 * 73) + (0 * 26) + (0 * 68) + (5 * 74) + (3 * 84) = 146 + 0 + 0 + 370 + 252 = 768.\n   - Discounted value = 768 * 0.9 = 691.2. This is still less than my outside offer of 779.\n   - My last offer was [1, 3, 0, 2, 0] which had a value of 73+78+148=299 to Player 1.\n   - Let's try to provide Player 1 with slightly less of each of those items, that's still greater than the current value of 433.8: [0, 5, 3, 2, 0]\n\n   - To be better than the outside offer, I need an offer such that: offer_value * 0.9 > 779 => offer_value > 865.5\n   - If I walk, I get 779. If Player 1 walks I get 779.\n   - I will now calculate the values again to be absolutely certain.\n   - Player 1's offer: [0, 5, 3, 2, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\n   - My total value is: (0 * 73) + (5 * 26) + (3 * 68) + (2 * 74) + (0 * 84) = 0 + 130 + 204 + 148 + 0 = 482\n   - Discounted by 0.9: 482 * 0.9 = 433.8.\n\n   - Since it is the final round, if I make a counteroffer it will be counted as a WALK.\n\nTherefore, since 433.8 < 779, it is best to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) Current Situation Analysis:\n   - My outside offer value is 701.\n   - The values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 39\n     - Item 2: 95\n     - Item 3: 22\n     - Item 4: 36\n     - Item 5: 14\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) influences future offers by reducing the value of deals reached in subsequent rounds.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - I have no current offer to evaluate.\n   - My task is to determine a potential counteroffer that maximizes my value without going below my outside offer or violating mistake principles.\n\n3) Calculation of Potential Offers:\n   - I need to maximize my value while leaving some room to make it acceptable to Player 2.\n\nOne possible fair initial offer might be to give away some items of lower value and retain more of the higher value items. Let's calculate:\n\n- Consider giving Player 2 more units of items that are less valuable to me and retaining more valuable items. An example offer:\n  - Offer 5 units of item 1 (keeping 2)\n  - Offer 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 1)\n  - Offer 3 units of item 3 (keeping 1)\n  - Offer 1 unit of item 4 (keeping 2)\n  - Offer 4 units of item 5 (keeping 2)\n\nMy retained items value calculations:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n\nTotal value to me from the retained items:\n- Total: 78 + 95 + 22 + 72 + 28 = 295\n\nThis total of 295 does not meet my outside offer of 701. Therefore, this offer does not make sense as it provides less value than my outside offer.\n\nI need to retain more high-value items, or provide Player 2 with a less valuable combination, while keeping my own value above 701. Let's counteroffer in a way that maximizes value retention:\n\nProposed offer:\n- Offer 2 units of item 1\n- Offer 0 units of item 2\n- Offer 1 unit of item 3\n- Offer 0 units of item 4\n- Offer 3 units of item 5\n\nRetained items value:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 39 = 195\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 95 = 190\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n\nTotal retained value:\n- Total: 195 + 190 + 66 + 108 + 42 = 601\n\nThis is still under my outside offer value of 701, so I need to propose a different counteroffer that maximizes retained value. After carefully recalculating, the goal is to use combinations that bring us closer or above the value of 701, avoiding the mistakes in the decision process.\n\nTherefore, I should aim for a conservative approach that provides a reasonable proposal while ensuring my fallback value is safeguarded until a better path unfolds in subsequent rounds. I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]}",

Since this is the first round, the discount factor hasn't affected any offers yet.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**: There is no offer from Player 2 yet.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffers**:\n   - I must propose an initial offer that will maximize my value without being worse than my outside offer.\n   - I calculate the total value of keeping all units:\n\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 6 = 18\n     - Item 2: 6 units \u00d7 23 = 138\n     - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 83 = 0\n     - Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 98 = 490\n     - Item 5: 7 units \u00d7 29 = 203\n     - Total value if I keep all items = 849\n\n   - This value (849) is greater than my outside offer (828), meaning I should try to get as much as possible close to this value without going lower than 828.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Objective**: Maximize my value from items. \n- **Strategize a Counteroffer**: I must aim for an offer where the value of the items I keep is at least 828. Since my total value keeping all items is 849, I should offer just a small amount, ensuring my retained value is greater than 828.\n\n**Offer Proposal (I keep and Player 2 receives):**\n- Offer Player 2: \n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 0 units\n  - Item 3: 0 units\n  - Item 4: 2 units\n  - Item 5: 0 units\n\n- **Value Retained (for me)**: \n  - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 6 = 0\n  - Item 2: 6 units \u00d7 23 = 138\n  - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 83 = 0\n  - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 98 = 294\n  - Item 5: 7 units \u00d7 29 = 203\n  - Total value retained = 635\n\nThe current total retained value is below 828, due to my initial error in balancing. Adjusting:\n\n**Revised Offer (I keep and Player 2 receives):**\n- Offer Player 2: \n  - Item 1: 0 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 0 units\n  - Item 4: 1 units\n  - Item 5: 0 units\n\n- **Revised Value Retained (for me)**: \n  - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 6 = 18\n  - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 23 = 69\n  - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 83 = 0\n  - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 98 = 392\n  - Item 5: 7 units \u00d7 29 = 203\n  - Total value retained = 682\n\n**Decision**: Given the retained value is below my outside offer, no counteroffer provides an acceptable valuation. Therefore, revise further.\n\nRe-revise: (The aim is near outside offer by tactical allocation)\n- To maximize my retained value above 828 without full retention, suggest:\n   - Item 1: 1 unit\n   - Item 2: 3 units\n   - Item 3: 0 units\n   - Item 4: 1 units\n   - Item 5: 0 units\n\n  Max valued possible with net nearness to 828 needed above realization.\n\n**Final Condition**: 849 - 827 correct recalibration securing 830 mutuality.\n\n### Action:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 1, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n- **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 828.\n- **Value of items involved:** My values are as follows:\n  - Item 1: 6\n  - Item 2: 23\n  - Item 3: 83\n  - Item 4: 98\n  - Item 5: 29\n- **Total pool of items:** \n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 6 units\n  - Item 3: 0 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 7 units\n- **Discount factor:** The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, means the value of the negotiation outcome in subsequent rounds gets slightly diminished, but for comparative analysis between outside offer and round 2 decision, we'll not need it at this moment.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n- **Current offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]:**\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n  - 0 unit of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 83 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 98 = 98\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n  - Total value = 6 + 23 + 98 + 29 = 156\n\n- **Evaluate against the outside offer:**\n  - The current offer value to me is 156, which is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 828.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n- **Accept the current offer?** The current offer (156) is lower than my outside offer (828), so accepting the current offer results in a bad outcome for me.\n\n- **Walk away?** Walking away guarantees me a value of 828, which is better than the current offer.\n\n- **Propose a counteroffer?** My previous counteroffer was [1, 3, 0, 1, 0]. To maximize my value given the context, I should try to keep more of the high-value items for myself (items 4 and 5), but still provide a serious offer to encourage acceptance.\n\n  - A counteroffer that maximizes my retention without making mistake 2 might allocate:\n    - Item 1: Offer 2 (I keep 1)\n    - Item 2: Offer 4 (I keep 2)\n    - Item 3: Offer 0\n    - Item 4: Offer 2 (I keep 3)\n    - Item 5: Offer 3 (I keep 4)\n\n  - Calculate the value I retain:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 23 = 46\n    - 0 unit of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 83 = 0\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n    - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 29 = 116\n    - Total value = 6 + 46 + 294 + 116 = 462\n\n- **Decision**: Even after considering this potential counteroffer, the value (462) is still far lower than my outside offer (828).

This means I would get:\n      - 0 units of item 1: 0 * 45 = 0\n      - 4 units of item 2: 4 * 59 = 236\n      - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 47 = 141\n      - 5 units of item 4: 5 * 48 = 240\n      - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 75 = 0\n      - Total value of current offer: 0 + 236 + 141 + 240 + 0 = 617\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (617) is less than my outside offer (767).

Maybe player 1 will accept a little of these items in return for some value.\n   - Let's try to give Player 1 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, and 1 unit of Item 4: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0].

I gave them [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] last round.\n      - I keep:\n        - Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n        - Item 2: 7 - 1 = 6\n        - Item 3: 6 - 1 = 5\n        - Item 4: 7 - 1 = 6\n        - Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n        - Total value: 3*45 + 6*59 + 5*47 + 6*48 + 1*75 = 135 + 354 + 235 + 288 + 75 = 1087. This is better than my outside offer. Let's offer [0,1,1,1,0].\n  \n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is bad (456 < 767).\n   - Making a counteroffer gives me a chance to secure a better deal than my outside offer.\n   - I will make a counteroffer that I think Player 1 might accept while still guaranteeing a better value than walking.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 3, 5, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
