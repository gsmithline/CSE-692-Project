Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 959. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1161 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 87 x 6 + 46 x 1 + 99 x 2 + 96 x 2\n    which is 958 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 959. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the optimal action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 198\n*   **My values for the items:** Item 1: 67, Item 2: 35, Item 3: 70, Item 4: 9, Item 5: 32\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 1, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. The current round is round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n    The value of this offer to me is (0 * 67) + (1 * 35) + (0 * 70) + (3 * 9) + (0 * 32) = 0 + 35 + 0 + 27 + 0 = 62.\n\n    Considering the discount factor, the present value of accepting this offer now is 62 * 0.9 = 55.8. This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 198.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 198 / 0.9 = 220 (this accounts for the discount).\n\n3) **Consider a few counteroffer scenarios:**\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Keep all of items 1, 3, and 5, and try to split 2 and 4.**\n\n    If I keep all of items 1, 3, and 5, I have a base value of (1 * 67) + (3 * 70) + (2 * 32) = 67 + 210 + 64 = 341.\n    This is greater than 220. So let's make the offer that gives Player 1 only items 2 and 4.\n    Counteroffer: [1, 5, 3, 4, 2]\n\n4) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is worth only 55.8 to me, which is far less than my outside offer of 198. Accepting is a bad decision.\n   - WALKing would guarantee me 198, but maybe I can get more by making a counteroffer.\n   - My counteroffer [1, 5, 3, 4, 2] gives me (1 * 67) + (3 * 70) + (2 * 32) = 341 before discount, and 341 * 0.9 = 306.9 with discount. Thus I'm better than outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 3, 4, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 2, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 2 + 49 x 4 + 14 x 2 + 55 x 2 + 89 x 6\n    which is 876 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 878. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's go through the steps to determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 878.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 4 per unit\n     - Item 2: 49 per unit\n     - Item 3: 14 per unit\n     - Item 4: 55 per unit\n     - Item 5: 89 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is: 5 units of Item 1, 4 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 6 units of Item 5.\n   - The discount factor affects the value in future rounds, but for the first round, it doesn't apply since it has a power of zero (gamma^0 = 1).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - To beat my outside offer value of 878, I need to keep more units of items that have high value to me.\n   - Let's calculate a potential counteroffer: Keeping 1 unit of Item 2, all units of Item 4, and all units of Item 5, and offering the rest to Player 2.\n\n     My value would be:\n     - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n     - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n     - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n     - Item 5: 6 \u00d7 89 = 534\n\n     Total value = 693\n\n     This total value (693) is less than my outside offer (878). I need to adjust my offer to maximize and try exceeding this value.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Given the high value of my outside offer, a reasonable strategy might involve retaining maximum high-value items to at least equal or exceed this fallback.\n   - I will attempt an offer keeping more of high-value items. For instance, keeping 0 units of Item 2 seems to be causing a drop in value. Let's refine:\n\n   Offer Player 2:\n   - 5 units of Item 1\n   - 0 units of Item 2\n   - 0 units of Item 3\n   - 0 units of Item 4\n   - 0 units of Item 5\n\n   Adjust keeping:\n   - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n   - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 49 = 196\n   - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n   - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n   - Item 5: 6 \u00d7 89 = 534\n\n   Total value = 868\n\n   Evaluating alternatives seems to present similar scenarios dropping below my outside offer.\n\nGiven the conditions and need to avoid suboptimal offers:\n\n- I cannot improve the current considerations, and given the high value of the fallback, I will choose:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This means that offers accepted in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am offered [0, 0, 1, 3, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 2 = 0 units\n    My total value if I accept the current offer is:\n    (3 * 56) + (0 * 53) + (1 * 22) + (1 * 63) + (0 * 61) = 168 + 0 + 22 + 63 + 0 = 253\n*   This is less than my outside offer value of 357. So, accepting the current offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to calculate what I would get if I propose other offers.\n\n    *   For example, let's consider keeping all the items for myself. My value would be:\n        (3 * 56) + (0 * 53) + (2 * 22) + (4 * 63) + (2 * 61) = 168 + 0 + 44 + 252 + 122 = 586\n        In this case, the offer to Player 1 would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n    *   Let's consider offering Player 1 half of the available items. In reality, this would be offering [1, 0, 1, 2, 1].

Start by giving away as few of the items that I value highly as possible. I value items 4 and 5 quite a bit, then item 1. Let's try keeping all the items 1, 4, and 5, and see if that gets me high enough:\n        (3 * 56) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 22) + (4 * 63) + (2 * 61) = 168 + 0 + 0 + 252 + 122 = 542.\n        Then I have to give away the 2 units of item 3, so give those away.\n        Thus I'd be offering [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This would get me a value of 542, which is acceptable.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away gives me my outside offer value of 357.\n*   Making a counteroffer is possible, and I have found one that gives me value 542: offer [0, 0, 2, 0, 0].\n\nI will make a counteroffer to maximize my outcome.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 61. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 28 x 0 + 80 x 0 + 83 x 0 + 12 x 2\n    which is 24 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 61. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 298\n    *   My item values: Item 1 = 15, Item 2 = 87, Item 3 = 23, Item 4 = 41, Item 5 = 7\n    *   Total items: Item 1 = 4, Item 2 = 2, Item 3 = 5, Item 4 = 4, Item 5 = 3\n    *   Discount factor: 0.9. Since we're in round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect the calculations yet. It will in later rounds if the negotiation continues.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n    *   Current offer to me: [2, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n    *   This means I receive 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (2 * 15) + (0 * 87) + (2 * 23) + (3 * 41) + (0 * 7) = 30 + 0 + 46 + 123 + 0 = 199\n\n3.  **Compare to outside offer:**\n\n    *   The current offer (199) is less than my outside offer (298). Therefore, accepting would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n4.  **Consider a potential counteroffer:**\n\n    *   I want an offer that is worth at least 298 to me.\n    *   Let's try to calculate a counteroffer such that I get a value close to my outside offer and also appears reasonable to the other player.\n    *   One strategy is to aim for a roughly equal split of the total value of the goods or to secure the most valuable item. Since Item 2 has the highest value to me (87), I could aim to secure both units of it.\n    *   Let's consider an offer where I keep all of Item 2 (2 units) and try to get more of Item 4 (4 units) than in the current offer.\n    *   To calculate a counteroffer, I need to calculate how much of each item I can keep to get a value above 298. If I keep [0, 2, 2, 4, 0], my value is (0*15) + (2*87) + (2*23) + (4*41) + (0*7) = 0 + 174 + 46 + 164 + 0 = 384. This leaves [4, 0, 3, 0, 3] for Player 1.\n    *   If I keep [1, 2, 2, 3, 0], my value is (1*15) + (2*87) + (2*23) + (3*41) + (0*7) = 15 + 174 + 46 + 123 + 0 = 358. This leaves [3, 0, 3, 1, 3] for Player 1.\n    *   If I keep [0, 2, 3, 3, 0], my value is (0*15) + (2*87) + (3*23) + (3*41) + (0*7) = 0 + 174 + 69 + 123 + 0 = 366. This leaves [4, 0, 2, 1, 3] for Player 1.\n    *   If I keep [1, 2, 3, 2, 0], my value is (1*15) + (2*87) + (3*23) + (2*41) + (0*7) = 15 + 174 + 69 + 82 + 0 = 340. This leaves [3, 0, 2, 2, 3] for Player 1.\n    *   If I keep [1, 2, 1, 3, 1], my value is (1*15) + (2*87) + (1*23) + (3*41) + (1*7) = 15 + 174 + 23 + 123 + 7 = 342. This leaves [3, 0, 4, 1, 2] for Player 1.\n\n5.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    *   The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n    *   I will make a counteroffer to get a value closer to the outside offer, but also not be too greedy and offer Player 1 reasonable items.\n    *   I will offer [3, 0, 3, 1, 3] to Player 1 and keep [1, 2, 2, 3, 0] which is a total value to me of 358, which is greater than 298.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 3, 1, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 458. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 56 x 3 + 8 x 2 + 91 x 3\n    which is 457 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 458. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that if I accept an offer in round 2, its value will be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 23) + (1 * 95) + (1 * 75) + (0 * 77) + (0 * 10) = 23 + 95 + 75 = 193.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of the current offer (193) is less than my outside offer (242). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to make an offer that is better than my outside offer. Let's calculate what I would have if I accept the current offer. I will have: 2 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 5 units of Item 4 and 4 units of Item 5.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 328. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 381 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 328.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 30, item 2 = 32, item 3 = 42, item 4 = 21, item 5 = 2.\n*   The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that getting a deal now is better than getting the same deal in a later round, since the value will be discounted.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer would be: (2 * 30) + (0 * 32) + (0 * 42) + (2 * 21) + (2 * 2) = 60 + 0 + 0 + 42 + 4 = 106.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (106) is much less than my outside offer (328). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of different potential counteroffers to see if I can find one that is better than my outside offer. My goal is to keep as much of the valuable items (item 3, item 2, item 1) as possible, while offering Player 1 enough to make them accept. I need to keep at least 328 worth of items for myself. I have the following total items to divide up with Player 1: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n\n    Since Player 1 has offered [2,0,0,2,2] I am keeping [4,3,1,2,3]. The value for this is:\n    4 * 30 + 3 * 32 + 1 * 42 + 2 * 21 + 3 * 2 = 120 + 96 + 42 + 42 + 6 = 306\n    This is still not better than my outside offer, so I should not accept.\n\n    I want to improve this counteroffer. How about I offer 2 units of item 1, keep 4. Offer 1 units of item 2, keep 2. Offer 0 units of item 3, keep 1. Offer 2 units of item 4, keep 2. Offer 2 units of item 5, keep 3.\n    So, I propose counter offer of [2,1,0,2,2]. This means I keep: [4,2,1,2,3]. Value is:\n    4 * 30 + 2 * 32 + 1 * 42 + 2 * 21 + 3 * 2 = 120 + 64 + 42 + 42 + 6 = 274\n    Still worse than my outside offer of 328.\n\n    Let's try another one:\n    Give away [1,0,0,2,2], Keep [5,3,1,2,3] = 5 * 30 + 3 * 32 + 1 * 42 + 2 * 21 + 3 * 2 = 150+96+42+42+6= 336\n\n    This is good - I will propose the offer [1,0,0,2,2]\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I should make a counteroffer. My proposed counteroffer is to offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 2, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of what it's worth in round 2, and an offer in round 2 is worth 90% of what it's worth in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]. This means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n      - My value if I accept: (1 * 30) + (3 * 32) + (1 * 42) + (1 * 21) + (2 * 2) = 30 + 96 + 42 + 21 + 4 = 193\n      - Since it's round 2, the discounted value is 193 * 0.9 = 173.7\n      - 173.7 < 328, so accepting this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to make an offer that keeps me above 328 / 0.9 = 364.44 value in round 2.\n   - I currently have 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable because 173.7 < 328. I need to construct a counteroffer.\n\nLet's calculate what I get to keep if I offer player 1 x units of item 1, y units of item 2, z units of item 3, w units of item 4 and v units of item 5:\nMy value is: (6-x)*30 + (3-y)*32 + (1-z)*42 + (4-w)*21 + (5-v)*2. \nI want to find x, y, z, w, v such that this value is > 364.44\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 a smaller amount, something like [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThen my value is 6*30 + 3*32 + 1*42 + 4*21 + 5*2 = 180 + 96 + 42 + 84 + 10 = 412\nSince 412 > 364.44. Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would yield me discounted value of 412 * 0.9 = 370.8 > 328\n\nLet's make the counteroffer: I offer Player 1 nothing.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 3, 0, 1, 0]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value to me is:\n    (1 * 30) + (3 * 32) + (0 * 42) + (1 * 21) + (0 * 2) = 30 + 96 + 0 + 21 + 0 = 147\n    Since this is round 3, the discounted value is 147 * (0.9)^2 = 147 * 0.81 = 119.07\n    Since 119.07 is less than my outside offer of 328, accepting this offer is not optimal.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, any counteroffer I make will be treated as a walk. Therefore, I need to compare the current best offer to my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 119.07 to me, which is less than my outside offer of 328.\n*   Since this is the final round, making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 19. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 91 x 0 + 8 x 2 + 7 x 0 + 41 x 0\n    which is 16 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 19.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 19. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 91 x 0 + 8 x 2 + 7 x 0 + 41 x 0\n    which is 16 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 19. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 6, 6, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 374. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 597 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 4 + 43 x 2 + 32 x 2 + 82 x 1 + 9 x 1\n    which is 373 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 374. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 374. Let's experiment with a few options, keeping in mind the total available items. Let's try keeping all of Item 4 for myself and most of item 2\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 the following: [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would mean I keep: [3, 2, 3, 1, 3]. My value would then be:\n\n(3 * 33) + (2 * 43) + (3 * 32) + (1 * 82) + (3 * 9) = 99 + 86 + 96 + 82 + 27 = 390\n\nThis value is greater than my outside offer of 374.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away would give me 374.\n*   I have identified a counteroffer that gives me a value of 390.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to make the counteroffer [4, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 33) + (0 * 43) + (3 * 32) + (0 * 82) + (3 * 9) = 0 + 0 + 96 + 0 + 27 = 123\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 123 * 0.9 = 110.7\n    *   Since 110.7 < 374, accepting this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Previous offer:** Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 1] in round 1. This means I would get 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of round 1 offer to me: (4 * 33) + (1 * 43) + (3 * 32) + (0 * 82) + (2 * 9) = 132 + 43 + 96 + 0 + 18 = 289\n    *   Discounted value of round 1 offer: 289 * 0.9 = 260.1\n    *   Since 260.1 < 374, accepting this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   **My round 1 offer:** I offered player 1 [4, 0, 0, 0, 0] which means I get 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5\n    *   Value of my round 1 offer to me: (3 * 33) + (2 * 43) + (3 * 32) + (1 * 82) + (3 * 9) = 99 + 86 + 96 + 82 + 27 = 390\n    *   Discounted value of my round 1 offer: 390 * 0.9 = 351\n    *   Since 351 < 374, my round 1 offer was worse than my outside offer (which is Mistake 2), and better than the discounted value of the outside offer (374*0.9=336.6). So I need to increase my offer to player 1 in order for it to be better.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 374. Let's try to give away as little as possible while ensuring player 1 receives enough to incentivize them to accept. My outside offer of 374.0 is better than the discount of 336.6, but walking away would still be less desirable than getting a final round offer better than 374. We need to work fast. \n\n    Let's aim for a value around 420 to allow for future discounts. Let's try giving Player 1 2 items of type 1, 1 of type 2, and 1 of type 4. Then I get to keep 5 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.\n\n    *My value: (5 * 33) + (1 * 43) + (3 * 32) + (0 * 82) + (3 * 9) = 165 + 43 + 96 + 0 + 27 = 331\n    *Too low. \n\n    Let's try giving Player 1 only 1 items of type 1 and 1 of type 4. Then I get to keep 6 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.\n\n    *My value: (6 * 33) + (2 * 43) + (3 * 32) + (0 * 82) + (3 * 9) = 198 + 86 + 96 + 0 + 27 = 407. Which is better than 374, great.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 0, 3, 0, 3] gives me a discounted value of 110.7, which is far less than my outside offer of 374.\n*   I will make a counteroffer, giving Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 515. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 515. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 0, 3, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 6 + 86 x 0 + 58 x 3 + 42 x 0 + 95 x 2\n    which is 514 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 515. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

However, since this is the last round (round 3), no future rounds exist to consider further discounts. A counteroffer now will essentially be equivalent to walking away, because any new offer by Player 2 would be treated as a WALK. Thus my action should maximize my value now.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer on the table: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n     - Value to me:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n       - 0 unit of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 86 = 0\n       - 0 unit of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 58 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n       - 0 unit of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 95 = 0\n     - Total value = 25 + 42 = 67\n\n   - Compare to my outside offer of 515:\n     - 67 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 515.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   \n   - The current offer yields 67 value to me, which is significantly worse than my outside offer of 515. Accepting this offer would be making Mistake 4.\n   \n   - Since Player 2 cannot make further counteroffers after this round, to avoid walking away from a better deal than my outside offer (Mistake 5), I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a higher value than 515 and ensure that I maximize my payoff.\n\nTo calculate a more beneficial counteroffer, I will aim to keep items that maximize my value while still being more than 515.\n\n- I will keep:\n  - 7 units of item 1 (7 x 25 = 175)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (2 x 86 = 172)\n  - 3 units of item 3 (3 x 58 = 174)\n  - 1 unit of item 4 (1 x 42 = 42)\n  - 2 units of item 5 (2 x 95 = 190)\n\nTotal value = 175 + 172 + 174 + 42 + 190 = 753\n\nThis allocation maximizes my value because I offer only 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2. I will make this counteroffer, to maximize my payoff in line with avoiding making a counteroffer worse than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, the offer to Player 2 would be: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nThis results in me keeping [7, 2, 3, 1, 2], yielding 753, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 515. \n\nSo, my action is: \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

I will aim to form an offer that maximizes my item values while ensuring Player 2 receives something acceptable.\n\nOne potential division:\n- Keep 2 units of Item 1 for myself: 2 x 30 = 60\n- Keep 3 units of Item 2 for myself: 3 x 72 = 216\n- Keep 0 units of Item 3 for myself: 0 x 29 = 0\n- Keep 0 units of Item 4 for myself: 0 x 27 = 0\n- Keep 0 units of Item 5 for myself: 0 x 46 = 0\n\nTotal value = 60 + 216 = 276\n\nOffer the rest:\n- Offers 2 units of item 1 to Player 2\n- Offers 5 units of item 2 to Player 2\n- All units of items 3, 4, and 5 to Player 2\n\nThis division gives me a value of 276, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 143, avoiding Mistakes 2 and 3.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 5, 2, 2, 3]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 674.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 55, item 2 = 61, item 3 = 46, item 4 = 35, item 5 = 15.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 8, item 3 = 2, item 4 = 2, item 5 = 3.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth 90% of what it would be worth this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** The current offer is [2, 5, 2, 2, 3] (offered to me). This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n\n    My value for accepting this offer would be:\n    (2 * 55) + (5 * 61) + (2 * 46) + (2 * 35) + (3 * 15) = 110 + 305 + 92 + 70 + 45 = 622\n\n    Comparing this to my outside offer of 674, the current offer is worse (622 < 674).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. Let's calculate some possible scenarios.\n    First, let's examine the consequences of giving everything to the other player. This would give me zero. Therefore, it's unwise to make a counteroffer that involves offering near everything to the other player, since that means I get almost nothing.\n\n    Let's start by making an offer where I keep the maximum amount of items I can, but still give Player 1 something. Let's try keeping [4, 8, 2, 2, 3] for myself (and offering nothing). That would be:\n    (4 * 55) + (8 * 61) + (2 * 46) + (2 * 35) + (3 * 15) = 220 + 488 + 92 + 70 + 45 = 915. So, if I keep everything, it is worth 915.\n\n    Since my outside offer is 674, I need to propose a counteroffer that gives the other player some items, but still leaves me with at least 674. Let's start by giving Player 1 1 unit of item 1. I would keep [3, 8, 2, 2, 3]. The value to me is (3*55) + (8*61) + (2*46) + (2*35) + (3*15) = 165 + 488 + 92 + 70 + 45 = 860. This is much better than my outside offer.\n\n    Now let's try offering [1, 3, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. I keep [3, 5, 2, 2, 3]. The value is (3*55) + (5*61) + (2*46) + (2*35) + (3*15) = 165 + 305 + 92 + 70 + 45 = 677. This is slightly better than my outside offer.\n\n    Now let's try offering [1, 2, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. I keep [3, 6, 2, 2, 3]. The value is (3*55) + (6*61) + (2*46) + (2*35) + (3*15) = 165 + 366 + 92 + 70 + 45 = 738.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept.\n*   I have calculated a few counteroffers that are better than my outside offer.\n*   I will propose the counteroffer [1, 2, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 3 + 61 x 6 + 46 x 2 + 35 x 1 + 15 x 1\n    which is 673 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 674. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 5, 2, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 674\n   - Item values: Item 1 = 55, Item 2 = 61, Item 3 = 46, Item 4 = 35, Item 5 = 15\n   - Total items: Item 1 = 4, Item 2 = 8, Item 3 = 2, Item 4 = 2, Item 5 = 3\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means that if the negotiation concludes this round, the value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. If it goes to the next round, it'll be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 2, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 55 = 55\n      - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 61 = 122\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 46 = 92\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 35 = 35\n      - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 15 = 0\n      - Total value of current offer: 55 + 122 + 92 + 35 + 0 = 304\n      - Discounted value of current offer: 304 * 0.9 = 273.6\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 273.6 is significantly less than my outside offer of 674. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 674, considering the discount factor. Let's calculate what I would keep and its value for different scenarios.\n     - **Scenario 1:** Give Player 1 [1, 2, 2, 1, 0] (their current offer)\n       - I keep [3, 6, 0, 1, 3]\n       - My value: (3 * 55) + (6 * 61) + (0 * 46) + (1 * 35) + (3 * 15) = 165 + 366 + 0 + 35 + 45 = 611\n       - Discounted value: 611 * 0.9 = 549.9 (Still less than 674)\n\n     - **Scenario 2:**  Give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (Keep everything)\n       - I keep [4, 8, 2, 2, 3]\n       - My value: (4 * 55) + (8 * 61) + (2 * 46) + (2 * 35) + (3 * 15) = 220 + 488 + 92 + 70 + 45 = 915\n       - Discounted value: 915 * 0.9 = 823.5 (Much better than 674)\n\n     - **Scenario 3:**  Try to find a slightly better counteroffer for me.\n       Give Player 1 [1, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n       - I keep [3, 5, 0, 0, 2]\n       - My value: (3 * 55) + (5 * 61) + (0 * 46) + (0 * 35) + (2 * 15) = 165 + 305 + 0 + 0 + 30 = 500\n       - Discounted value: 500 * 0.9 = 450 (Much worse than 674)\n       - This is obviously wrong.\n     - **Scenario 4:** Try a different scenario.\n       Give Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n       - I keep [4, 7, 2, 2, 3]\n       - My value: (4 * 55) + (7 * 61) + (2 * 46) + (2 * 35) + (3 * 15) = 220 + 427 + 92 + 70 + 45 = 854\n       - Discounted value: 854 * 0.9 = 768.6\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n- Accepting the current offer is bad. Walking away would be okay. Making a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] isn't smart (Mistake 3). A counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] looks beneficial.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 1 x 3 + 40 x 2 + 94 x 3 + 89 x 0\n    which is 365 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 366. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 160. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 3 + 30 x 5 + 92 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 62 x 0\n    which is 159 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 160. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 160\n    *   My values for the items: item 1: 3, item 2: 30, item 3: 92, item 4: 82, item 5: 62\n    *   Total items: item 1: 3, item 2: 6, item 3: 1, item 4: 3, item 5: 4\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer later is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n    The current offer to *me* is [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]. This means I would get 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n    *   Value of the current offer to me: (1 \\* 3) + (2 \\* 30) + (0 \\* 92) + (1 \\* 82) + (1 \\* 62) = 3 + 60 + 0 + 82 + 62 = 207\n\n    Since 207 > 160, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*. However, we are in round 1, so there is potential for a better outcome.\n\n3.  **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to calculate the value of the items that I would keep for myself.\n\n    The total items are: [3, 6, 1, 3, 4]. If Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 0, 1, 1], then Player 1 gets [2, 4, 1, 2, 3].\n\n    Let's try to calculate the value if I keep items [3, 6, 1, 3, 4] myself, which would give player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    Value: (3 * 3) + (6 * 30) + (1 * 92) + (3 * 82) + (4 * 62) = 9 + 180 + 92 + 246 + 248 = 775\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I propose to give player 1 [1, 2, 0, 1, 1], and I keep [2, 4, 1, 2, 3]:\n        Value of [2, 4, 1, 2, 3] = (2*3) + (4*30) + (1*92) + (2*82) + (3*62) = 6 + 120 + 92 + 164 + 186 = 568\n        This would give player 1 the values originally assessed in round 1, with the assumption that you would not have accepted.\n\n    Let's test a different counter offer of [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]:\n    My Value: (3 * 3) + (3 * 30) + (1 * 92) + (2 * 82) + (2 * 62) = 9 + 90 + 92 + 164 + 124 = 479\n\n    Since the initial offer is 207 and my outside offer is 160, I want to see if I can get at least 160.\n\n    If I can get more than 160 now, I can get even more later with discount factor = 0.9\n    However, there is also a risk that if I offer something to the opponent they may walk away.\n\n    Let's try to get a better deal. Consider the counteroffer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This would make the values:\n    My Value: (3 * 3) + (5 * 30) + (1 * 92) + (3 * 82) + (4 * 62) = 9 + 150 + 92 + 246 + 248 = 745\n\n    Let's offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n    Consider the offer [2, 4, 1, 2, 3] that player 1 gets. The opponent value would be:\n        (2 * item 1) + (4 * item 2) + (1 * item 3) + (2 * item 4) + (3 * item 5)\n\n4.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    The current offer is better than my outside offer. However, it is round 1, and I think I can get a better deal.\n\n    I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 0 + 24 x 1 + 56 x 3 + 76 x 1 + 88 x 4\n    which is 620 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 621.

The retaining value exceeds the outside offer value, and this offer respects all mistake-avoidance guidelines.\n- This offer is greater than my outside offer but still leaves a non-negligible share to Player 2, ensuring it's not too harsh and thus realistic.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to propose the counteroffer that maximizes my retained value while still adhering to fair-play principles.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 0 + 24 x 1 + 56 x 3 + 76 x 1 + 88 x 4\n    which is 620 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 621. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 78. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 94 x 0 + 21 x 1 + 87 x 0 + 18 x 3\n    which is 75 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 78. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 723.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 77, 45, 9, 47, 98 respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 1, 4, 7, 4, 7 respectively.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 2, 4, 2, 4] of items 1-5 respectively. This means Player 1 keeps [0, 2, 3, 2, 3] items. I get:\n       - 1 * 77 + 2 * 45 + 4 * 9 + 2 * 47 + 4 * 98 = 77 + 90 + 36 + 94 + 392 = 689\n       - Since 689 < 723 (my outside offer), this offer is worse than walking away right now.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few counteroffers and calculate their values. Remember, I want to keep as much as possible for myself.\n\n       - **Counteroffer 1: Player 1 gets [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].** This means I keep all items. My value would be:\n           - 1 * 77 + 4 * 45 + 7 * 9 + 4 * 47 + 7 * 98 = 77 + 180 + 63 + 188 + 686 = 1194.\n           - This is an extreme offer.\n\n       - **Counteroffer 2: Player 1 gets [1, 4, 7, 4, 7].** This means I get nothing, with value 0. This is also an extreme offer.\n\n       - **Counteroffer 3: Player 1 gets [0, 2, 3, 2, 3] (mirroring their offer to me).** This means I keep [1, 2, 4, 2, 4] for myself. My value is:\n           - 1 * 77 + 2 * 45 + 4 * 9 + 2 * 47 + 4 * 98 = 77 + 90 + 36 + 94 + 392 = 689.\n           - This is lower than my outside offer.\n\n       - **Counteroffer 4: Giving Player 1 an offer that barely makes me better than my outside offer.** We need to find a division that gives me slightly over 723.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer of 689 is worse than my outside option of 723, so I should not ACCEPT.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that is better than 723. Let's consider the value of each item to me: item 5 is worth 98, item 1 is worth 77, item 4 is worth 47 and item 2 is worth 45. Item 3 is worth only 9.\n   - I want to keep the valuable items.\n   - I'll try a counteroffer where I keep item 1 and item 5 entirely and some units of items 2, 3, and 4:\n       - I keep item 1 (1 unit) and item 5 (7 units) = 77 + 7 * 98 = 77 + 686 = 763\n       - This is better than my outside offer. Now let's decide how to offer up the rest of the items. I have 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, and 4 units of item 4. I can offer them all to Player 1.\n       - My proposed offer is: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to me means I keep 1 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 7 of item 5. Value is: 77 + 4*45 + 7*9 + 4*47 + 7*98 = 77 + 180 + 63 + 188 + 686 = 1194 which is good.\n       - Offer: [1, 4, 7, 4, 7] to Player 1.\n       - Counteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to me. This gives me value 77 + 4*45 + 7*9 + 4*47 + 7*98 = 1194 which is greater than 723.\n       - This results in me keeping everything and giving Player 1 nothing.\n\n   - Since that is an extreme offer, and could lead to the other player walking away, I will adjust the counteroffer slightly to make it more acceptable to the other player:\n\n       - Let Player 1 have item 3 completely, and give the rest to me. So, I get: [1, 4, 0, 4, 7].\n       - This becomes: 77 + 4*45 + 0 + 4*47 + 7*98 = 77 + 180 + 0 + 188 + 686 = 1131. This is greater than my outside offer.\n       - Offer: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 7, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 129. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 915 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 1 + 93 x 1 + 90 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 15 x 0\n    which is 125 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 129. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 4, 2, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 920. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 3 + 90 x 6 + 86 x 2 + 12 x 0 + 12 x 3\n    which is 919 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 920. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 4, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 4 + 87 x 3 + 43 x 2 + 36 x 2 + 38 x 4\n    which is 931 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 932. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my action, I will follow the step-by-step process to evaluate the situation and possible offers:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 932\n- **Values of the Items (Per Unit):** \n  - Item 1: 90\n  - Item 2: 87\n  - Item 3: 43\n  - Item 4: 36\n  - Item 5: 38\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - 4 units of Item 1\n  - 5 units of Item 2\n  - 2 units of Item 3\n  - 5 units of Item 4\n  - 4 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, means that the value of the negotiation outcome decreases slightly with each additional round. Thus, earlier resolutions are generally more valuable.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I must prepare an initial counteroffer. I need to ensure that any offer I make results in a value greater than my outside offer of 932.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of keeping all items:\n\n- Total value = (4 * 90) + (5 * 87) + (2 * 43) + (5 * 36) + (4 * 38)\n- Total value = 360 + 435 + 86 + 180 + 152 = 1213\n\nSince my outside offer is 932, I must find a division where what I keep results in a value equal to or greater than 932.\n\nLet's consider different divisions and calculate the value of what I would retain:\n\n#### Proposal Considerations:\n1. Keep: [4, 3, 2, 3, 3] - offer [0, 2, 0, 2, 1] to Player 2\n   - Value = (4 * 90) + (3 * 87) + (2 * 43) + (3 * 36) + (3 * 38)\n   - Value = 360 + 261 + 86 + 108 + 114 = 929\n\n2. Further adjust to aim for exactly around 932 or slightly more:\n   - Keep: [4, 2, 2, 3, 3] - offer [0, 3, 0, 2, 1] to Player 2\n   - Value = (4 * 90) + (2 * 87) + (2 * 43) + (3 * 36) + (3 * 38)\n   - Value = 360 + 174 + 86 + 108 + 114 = 842\n\nThe above offer leads to a lower value. Let's readjust:\n\n3. Keep: [3, 3, 2, 3, 3] - offer [1, 2, 0, 2, 1] to Player 2\n   - Value = (3 * 90) + (3 * 87) + (2 * 43) + (3 * 36) + (3 * 38)\n   - Value = 270 + 261 + 86 + 108 + 114 = 839\n\nRe-evaluation required. Optimize further:\n\n4. Keep: [3, 3, 2, 4, 2] - offer [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n   - Value = (3 * 90) + (3 * 87) + (2 * 43) + (4 * 36) + (2 * 38)\n   - Value = 270 + 261 + 86 + 144 + 76 = 837\n\n### Decision\n\nI have adjusted to get as close to 932 value as possible without exceeding or enormously shrinking my offer. Upon recalculating, I must either walk or try a strategic edge hold.\n\nProposing to keep maximum units of high-value items with possible offers: let's revise, and propose a more feasible offer ensuring values overlapping:\n\n5. Counteroffer revised:\n   - Keep: [4, 2, 2, 3, 3] - offer [0, 3, 0, 2, 1]\n   - Value: re-calculated with ceasing immediate minor adjustments.\n   - Directing a new counter after consideration - some division yielded unattractive: I am sticking with demand, close to the division below further;\n\n### Final Counter Proposal:\nI will propose offering Player 2 the following counteroffer: [1, 2, 0, 2, 2] given recalibrated retains a sound basis on backup recalculation recently overlooked.\n   \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 2]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 5, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 4 + 32 x 5 + 29 x 5 + 16 x 6 + 6 x 3\n    which is 507 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 509. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 3, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 5, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 4 + 32 x 5 + 29 x 5 + 16 x 6 + 6 x 3\n    which is 507 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 509. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 2, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [5, 3, 2, 5, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 3, 2, 5, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 509.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 22, item 2 = 32, item 3 = 29, item 4 = 16, item 5 = 6.\n*   Total items: 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. The discount factor influences the value of accepting an offer versus waiting for future offers. A higher discount factor means future rounds are valued more highly, making waiting more attractive.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [5, 3, 2, 5, 1].  This means I would get 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. Let's calculate the value of this offer:\n    *   5 * 22 = 110\n    *   3 * 32 = 96\n    *   2 * 29 = 58\n    *   5 * 16 = 80\n    *   1 * 6 = 6\n    *   Total value of current offer: 110 + 96 + 58 + 80 + 6 = 350\n\n*   This value of 350 is less than my outside offer of 509.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer. Here's what I have in total: 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer (350) is worse than my outside offer (509). Therefore, I should not accept.\n*   Walking away gives me 509. I want to see if I can propose a counteroffer with a value greater than 509.\n*   Let's evaluate a possible counteroffer. A counteroffer must involve giving some items to the other player, and thus involves keeping some items.\n\nI need to determine a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer and also better than my previous offer. My previous offer was [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]. This means I was keeping [7, 5, 5, 4, 3]. The value of this would be 7 * 22 + 5 * 32 + 5 * 29 + 4 * 16 + 3 * 6 = 154 + 160 + 145 + 64 + 18 = 541.\n\nNow I need to propose an offer. I know that I need to aim for a total value to myself that is greater than my outside offer of 509.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 [2, 1, 1, 1, 0].  That means I keep [5, 4, 4, 5, 3].  The value of this to me would be:\n5 * 22 + 4 * 32 + 4 * 29 + 5 * 16 + 3 * 6 = 110 + 128 + 116 + 80 + 18 = 452. This is not better than my outside offer of 509.\n\nI need to keep more items. Let's try the following offer: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That means I keep [6, 5, 5, 6, 3]. The value of this to me would be:\n6 * 22 + 5 * 32 + 5 * 29 + 6 * 16 + 3 * 6 = 132 + 160 + 145 + 96 + 18 = 551.\n\nThis is better than my outside offer. And this offer is better than my previous offer from round 1 because my previous offer would have given the other player 2 of item 4.\n\nSo, I will make a counteroffer of [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1156.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 35, item 2 = 84, item 3 = 70, item 4 = 86, item 5 = 87.\n   - The total pool of items is: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer later in the game is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n   - The current offer is [2, 1, 3, 3, 1]. This means Player 1 is offering me:\n      - 2 units of item 1\n      - 1 unit of item 2\n      - 3 units of item 3\n      - 3 units of item 4\n      - 1 unit of item 5\n   - My value for this offer is:\n      - (2 * 35) + (1 * 84) + (3 * 70) + (3 * 86) + (1 * 87) = 70 + 84 + 210 + 258 + 87 = 709\n\n   - My outside offer is 1156. Since 709 is less than 1156, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - I need to determine how many of each item I should keep to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n   - Let's try keeping all of item 2, item 4 and item 5. Then keep the rest such that it is greater than 1156.\n\n   - Suppose I offer Player 1 [5, 0, 5, 0, 0]. This means I keep [0, 4, 0, 6, 3].\n   - The value of this is:\n      - (0 * 35) + (4 * 84) + (0 * 70) + (6 * 86) + (3 * 87) = 0 + 336 + 0 + 516 + 261 = 1113\n\n   - This is still below the outside offer of 1156. Let's try something different.\n\n   - To avoid Mistake 2, I should aim to keep items that give me a value greater than 1156.\n   - Let's aim to keep all of item 2, item 4, item 5 and some of item 3.\n   - If I keep [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the max value is 1638.\n   - Let me try to keep [3, 4, 2, 6, 3] meaning I will offer [2, 0, 3, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n   - My value is:\n      - (3 * 35) + (4 * 84) + (2 * 70) + (6 * 86) + (3 * 87) = 105 + 336 + 140 + 516 + 261 = 1358\n   - 1358 > 1156. So this is a valid counteroffer.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer is not good enough.\n   - Walking away means I get 1156.\n   - The counteroffer [2, 0, 3, 0, 0] is better.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 2, 1, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 7, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 0 + 64 x 3 + 62 x 7 + 89 x 0 + 16 x 0\n    which is 626 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 640. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I need to analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) Current Situation Analysis:\n   - My outside offer value is 640.\n   - The values of each item to me: \n     - Item 1: 30\n     - Item 2: 64\n     - Item 3: 62\n     - Item 4: 89\n     - Item 5: 16\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 8 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 0 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences future rounds by reducing the value of the negotiated outcome by 10% for each additional round.\n\n2) Assessment of Offers:\n   - There is no current offer to evaluate.\n   - I need to propose an initial offer. To be advantageous, it should yield a value greater than my outside offer of 640.\n\n   Let's calculate the potential value of keeping certain items and offering others:\n   - Suppose I choose to keep all units of item 3 and item 4 (high value to me) and offer all of items 1 and 2 to Player 2. This leaves the offer as [3, 3, 0, 0, 0].\n   - My value from keeping these items: \n     - Item 3: 8 \u00d7 62 = 496\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n   - Total value if I keep these: 496 + 89 = 585\n   - This is less than my outside offer of 640, so it's not an acceptable first offer.\n\n   Now let's try keeping different amounts to increase my value:\n   - Try keeping 2 units of item 3 and the single unit of item 4 (more balanced approach):\n     - Giving Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5\n     - Keeping for myself: 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4\n     - My value:\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n     - Total value: 124 + 89 = 213, still less than the outside offer of 640.\n\n   Let's adjust further:\n   - Try keeping 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 of item 5:\n     - Offering Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, and 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5\n     - My value:\n       - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n     - Total value: 248 + 89 = 337, still less than the outside offer of 640.\n\n   Let's keep changing until we try another mix:\n   - Consider trying a higher stake in a mix that leads to a value exceeding 640:\n     - Keep 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 0 of item 5:\n     - Giving away: 3, 2, 1, 0, 0\n     - My value:\n       - Item 2: 1 x 64 = 64\n       - Item 3: 7 x 62 = 434\n       - Item 4: 1 x 89 = 89\n     - Total value: 64 + 434 + 89 = 587, falling short again.\n\n   Let's try the following: Keep 0, 0, 8, 0, 0:\n     - Offering Player 2: 3, 3, 0, 1, 0\n     - My value:\n       - Item 4: 1 * 89 = 89\n     - This clearly won't work.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer where I keep all the units of item 3 and item 2, but offer the rest to Player 2:\n\n3) Decision:\n   - I will offer Player 2  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] from my remaining units, focusing entirely on retaining high-value goods to maximize my outcome beyond the outside offer.\n   - My retained value will be 640 and ensure any future negotiation will start from a similar stake without breaking my fall-back.\n\nI will make a careful and assertive offer that opens for possible better exchanges allowing for fair bargaining upfront.

However, this only affects outcomes after round 1, currently lowering the value slightly if accepted in round 2 (0.9^1 = 0.9).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives me no items, my value = 0 which is less than my outside offer.\n   - Since I made the last counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], my value would be calculated based on keeping [3, 2, 8, 1, 0]:\n     - Value = (3 * 30) + (2 * 64) + (8 * 62) + (1 * 89) + (0 * 16) \n     - Value = 90 + 128 + 496 + 89 + 0 = 803\n     - This value is already much greater than my outside offer of 640.\n   - Any counteroffer should aim to have a value of 640 or more for me.\n\n3) **Make a decision**\n   - Should I accept the current offer? No, it gives me 0 value.\n   - Should I walk away? Not yet, since I can aim for a better value.\n   - I can propose a counteroffer that guarantees me a value of more than 640 when considering the discount factor (0.9 multiplier).\n\nGiven my previous offer, one strategy is to slightly adjust it, considering the discount factor, to ensure my value after the proposal remains above 640. \n\nLet's propose a counteroffer and aim to have at least 1 item from item 2, which is valuable, while still keeping significant items from others:\n\n- Offer to Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n- I keep: [3, 2, 8, 1, 0], which has a reduced current value due to the discount factor:\n  - Value (round 2 discount) = 0.9 * (803) = 722.7\n\nThis value remains above my outside offer of 640 even after the discount.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 116. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 561 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 2, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 2 + 80 x 1 + 2 x 2 + 3 x 1 + 88 x 0\n    which is 115 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 116. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that a deal in a later round is worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n      - Value of accepting: (0 * 14) + (1 * 80) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 3) + (0 * 88) = 80.\n\n      -Since it is round 2, we need to consider discount factor. If we accept it is round 2, so the value will be discounted by (0.9)^(2-1)=0.9.\n      So value of accepting = 80*0.9 = 72\n\n   - This value (72) is much lower than my outside offer (116).\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 116 * (1/0.9) = 128.89 to be strictly better than walking away.\n      - Keeping everything: (3 * 14) + (3 * 80) + (8 * 2) + (1 * 3) + (0 * 88) = 42 + 240 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 301\n      - My offer to Player 1 must give me a value of more than 116 * (1/0.9) = 128.89.\n      \n      Let's find some possible counteroffers. We know from round 1 that Player 1 is offering me 1 item 2, so maybe they value item 2 a lot.\n      - Keep 1 unit of item 2. Offer [3, 2, 8, 1, 0]. I keep [3, 1, 8, 1, 0]. My value will be (3 * 14) + (1 * 80) + (8 * 2) + (1 * 3) + (0 * 88) = 42+80+16+3+0 = 141. \n      - 141*0.9 >116\n      - Keep 2 units of item 2. Offer [3, 1, 8, 1, 0]. I keep [3, 2, 8, 1, 0]. My value will be (3 * 14) + (2 * 80) + (8 * 2) + (1 * 3) + (0 * 88) = 42+160+16+3+0 = 221\n      - 221*0.9 > 116\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is bad, as 72 < 116.\n   - Walking away guarantees me 116.\n   - Counteroffer: The counteroffer must give me a value > 116/0.9 = 128.89\n   - I will offer [3, 2, 8, 1, 0]. This gives me a value of 141, so 141*0.9 = 126.9 which is less than 116!\n   - I will offer [3, 1, 8, 1, 0]. This gives me a value of 221, so 221*0.9 = 198.9, which is greater than 116.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 0 + 50 x 1 + 52 x 4 + 73 x 0 + 3 x 1\n    which is 261 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 262. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 3, 5, 5]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 5 of item 5. Player 1 is getting the remainder.\n    *   My value for this offer is: (0 * 93) + (0 * 21) + (3 * 41) + (5 * 51) + (5 * 3) = 0 + 0 + 123 + 255 + 15 = 393.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value to me (393) is less than my outside offer (499). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer. Since player 1 offered me items 3, 4, and 5, let me consider how I could use items 1 and 2 to increase my value in a potential counteroffer.\n\nLet's calculate a few scenarios for possible counteroffers. To calculate what I keep, I take the total number of each item type, and subtract how much I offer to player 1.\n* Counteroffer where I keep all items 1 and 2, and the other items, give [3, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. Value for me is: (3 * 93) + (1 * 21) + (5 * 41) + (5 * 51) + (5 * 3) = 279 + 21 + 205 + 255 + 15 = 775\n* Counteroffer where I keep 2 of item 1 and the other items, and give [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. Value for me is: (2 * 93) + (0 * 21) + (5 * 41) + (5 * 51) + (5 * 3) = 186 + 0 + 205 + 255 + 15 = 661\n* Counteroffer where I keep 1 of item 1 and the other items, and give [2, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. Value for me is: (1 * 93) + (0 * 21) + (5 * 41) + (5 * 51) + (5 * 3) = 93 + 0 + 205 + 255 + 15 = 568\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept it.\n*   I should not walk away immediately, as there are potentially beneficial deals.\n\nGiven my outside offer of 499, a counteroffer of giving Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] results in a payoff of 661 to me. I will start with this counteroffer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 499. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 1 + 21 x 1 + 41 x 3 + 51 x 5 + 3 x 2\n    which is 498 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 499. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 5, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 2, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 499\n*   My values per item: Item 1: 93, Item 2: 21, Item 3: 41, Item 4: 51, Item 5: 3\n*   Total items: Item 1: 3, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that deals made in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 5]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 5 = 0\n    Value of current offer: (2 * 93) + (1 * 21) + (3 * 41) + (3 * 51) + (0 * 3) = 186 + 21 + 123 + 153 + 0 = 483\n*   Value of current offer *with discount*: 483 * 0.9^(2-1) = 483 * 0.9 = 434.7\n*   Comparison to outside offer: 434.7 < 499. Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away *at this stage*, as it yields a value lower than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that are better than my outside offer, accounting for the discount factor in round 3. I need an offer that gives me more than 499/0.9^(3-1) = 499/0.81 = 616.05 worth of items in the next round.\n    *   **Counteroffer example:** Keeping [2, 1, 3, 3, 0] like before gives a value of 483.\n    *   **Counteroffer example:** Keeping [3, 1, 5, 5, 5] means offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This yields 3*93+1*21+5*41+5*51+5*3 = 279+21+205+255+15 = 775, meaning the opponent is offered nothing, which might be suboptimal at this stage.\n    *   **Counteroffer example:** Keep [1, 1, 3, 3, 3] = 93+21+123+153+9 = 499, which is exactly my outside offer. I would need to offer [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]. \n    *   **Counteroffer example:** Keep [2, 1, 4, 4, 4] = 186+21+164+204+12 = 587. Offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. In the next round, after discounting, this is about equal to my outside option.\n    *   **Counteroffer example:** I offer [0, 0, 3, 5, 5]. I keep everything else.\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 5 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 5 = 0\n    Value of current offer: (3 * 93) + (1 * 21) + (2 * 41) + (0 * 51) + (0 * 3) = 279 + 21 + 82 + 0 + 0 = 382\n*   Value of this counteroffer *with discount*: 382 * 0.9^(2-1) = 382 * 0.9 = 343.8\n*   Comparison to outside offer: 343.8 < 499. Reject this plan.\n\n* Counteroffer that gives me more than 616.05 in the next round.\n    * Item 1: Keep 3, so offer 0. 3 * 93 = 279\n    * Item 2: Keep 1, so offer 0. 1 * 21 = 21\n    * Item 3: Keep x, so offer 5-x, x * 41. If x = 5. Then 5 * 41 = 205\n    * Item 4: Keep y, so offer 5-y, y * 51. If y = 5. Then 5 * 51 = 255\n    * Item 5: Keep z, so offer 5-z, z * 3. If z = 5. Then 5 * 3 = 15\n    Total Value: 279 + 21 + 205 + 255 + 15 = 775\n*   Value of this counteroffer in the next round: 775 * 0.9^(3-1) = 775 * 0.81 = 627.75\n*Comparison to outside offer: 627.75 > 499. Accept this plan. Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nSince the value of the current offer is much worse than my outside option, I should not accept. To have a better chance of reaching a deal that is beneficial to me, I must make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 704.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 84, 42, 34, 79, and 91, respectively.\n   - The total pool of items is 6 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My value for this offer is: (0 * 84) + (0 * 42) + (1 * 34) + (2 * 79) + (0 * 91) = 34 + 158 = 192. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 704.\n\n   - Consider potential counteroffers. I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value. Let's calculate the total value of all items to me: (6 * 84) + (2 * 42) + (3 * 34) + (5 * 79) + (1 * 91) = 504 + 84 + 102 + 395 + 91 = 1176.\n\n   - I need to ensure my counteroffer retains enough items to be worth more than 704 to me.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n   Since the current offer is worth 192, which is far less than my outside offer of 704, I should not accept it. I will make a counteroffer.\n\n   I need to decide how many of each item to offer to Player 1. A good starting point is to aim for a roughly even split of the total value, while ensuring I retain at least 704 worth of items.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I keep 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nValue to me = (4*84) + (1*42) + (2*34) + (3*79) + (1*91) = 336 + 42 + 68 + 237 + 91 = 774.\nRemaining items for player 1 would be:\nItem 1: 6 - 4 = 2\nItem 2: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 3: 3 - 2 = 1\nItem 4: 5 - 3 = 2\nItem 5: 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSo the offer to player 1 will be [2, 1, 1, 2, 0]. Since my value is higher than 704, this is better than walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 704. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 990 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 1, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 4 + 42 x 2 + 34 x 1 + 79 x 2 + 91 x 1\n    which is 703 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 704. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 0, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 1 + 68 x 2 + 45 x 2 + 54 x 0 + 69 x 8\n    which is 800 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 801. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to make an informed decision.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 801\n   - My values for the items: item 1 = 22, item 2 = 68, item 3 = 45, item 4 = 54, item 5 = 69\n   - Total pool of items: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. The discount factor influences the value of future offers. Accepting now gives me the full value. Waiting another round reduces my value by 10%.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. That is, 0 units of items 1-4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value if I accept this is (0 * 22) + (0 * 68) + (0 * 45) + (0 * 54) + (1 * 69) = 69.\n   - Potential counteroffers: This requires calculating the value of keeping different numbers of items.\n   - How do these values compare to my outside offer value? The current offer of 69 is significantly worse than my outside offer of 801.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I would be far better off with my outside offer. Therefore, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer. Since it is round 1, walking away seems premature. I should attempt to negotiate.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that would give me more value than my outside offer. I have 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 8 units of item 5.\n\nI need to keep enough items to be worth more than 801. Let's try keeping all the items:\n(4 * 22) + (3 * 68) + (2 * 45) + (5 * 54) + (8 * 69) = 88 + 204 + 90 + 270 + 552 = 1204. This is more than my outside offer, so any division must give some items to Player 1 to be a valid offer.\n\nLet's start by offering Player 1 a small amount and see how that changes my value. The current offer from Player 1 is to give me one unit of item 5. This implies they value item 5 highly. Thus I'll start by offering items they likely value less.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep [3, 2, 1, 4, 8]. My value would then be:\n(3 * 22) + (2 * 68) + (1 * 45) + (4 * 54) + (8 * 69) = 66 + 136 + 45 + 216 + 552 = 1015.\nSince 1015 is greater than 801, this is an acceptable offer for me in terms of absolute value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 249. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 1 + 93 x 0 + 63 x 1 + 42 x 1 + 32 x 3\n    which is 248 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 249. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 4, 3].

Accepting this offer would be a Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate the value of different potential divisions and compare them to my outside offer. I want to find an offer to Player 1 that would leave me with a value greater than 744.\n\n**3) Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (worth 395) is significantly less than my outside offer (744), I should not accept. I also won't walk away, because it's only the first round and there's room for negotiation. I need to formulate a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 the following: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

This is the maximum value I can get.\n\nHowever, offering nothing to Player 1 is likely to be rejected immediately and might not be the best negotiating strategy. Let's try to offer something, but keep my total value above 744. Let's try offering Player 1 [1,1,1,1,1].  This leaves me with:\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 6 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n\nMy value would then be: (4 * 40) + (4 * 42) + (3 * 75) + (6 * 52) + (4 * 10) = 160 + 168 + 225 + 312 + 40 = 905.\nThis is greater than my outside option of 744.\n\n**Final Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

We are currently in round 2.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer:**\n   - Current offer is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], meaning I receive:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 47\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 93\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 63\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 42\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 32\n   - Total value = 47 + 93 + 63 + 42 + 32 = 277\n\n2. **Value of Current Offer Adjusted by Discount:**\n   - As we're in round 2, discount multiplier = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n   - Adjusted value = 0.9 * 277 = 249.3\n\n3. **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n   - Adjusted value of current offer = 249.3, which is marginally higher than my outside offer of 249.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n1. **Accept the Current Offer?**\n   - The adjusted current offer value (249.3) is slightly better than my outside offer of 249. Therefore, accepting it prevents the risk of losing value in the final round due to further discounting.\n\n2. **Walk Away and Take the Outside Offer?**\n   - Not favorable in this situation as the current offer is slightly better.\n\n3. **Make a Counteroffer?**\n   - I would need to devise a counteroffer that yields a value clearly above 249, factoring in the discount for future rounds. However, the current offer is already marginally better, minimizing further negotiation effort or loss due to discounting.\n\nBased on this analysis, accepting the current offer is a sound decision as it provides a value higher than my outside offer and avoids the risk of additional rounds. Therefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 83 x 0 + 19 x 5 + 40 x 2 + 96 x 2\n    which is 367 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 368. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

In this first round, it does not affect the calculation, but in future rounds, the total value will be multiplied by 0.9 for each subsequent round after the first.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table. Therefore, I should consider making an initial offer that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer.\n   - Let's explore possible counteroffers to ensure a value greater than 368.\n\n3) **Calculate potential counteroffers:**\n   - First, I need at least 368 value. Let's explore different combinations to reach that:\n\n     Suppose I keep:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n     - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 19 = 95\n     - 1 units of item 4: 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n\n     Total value if I keep these: 87 + 166 + 95 + 40 + 192 = 580\n\n     Since this value (580) is well above my outside offer (368), I can consider offering the reminder to Player 2.\n\n4) **Offer Proposal:**\n   - I will offer Player 2 the remaining units:\n     - Item 1: 0 units (I'm keeping all 3)\n     - Item 2: 2 units (I'm offering 2 out of 4)\n     - Item 3: 2 units (I'm offering 2 out of 7)\n     - Item 4: 2 units (I'm offering 2 out of 3)\n     - Item 5: 5 units (I'm offering 5 out of 7)\n\n   This distribution leaves me with a high enough value (580) to be satisfactory and ensure I don't make any of the five negotiation mistakes.\n\nGiven this analysis, my action will be to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 2, 5]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 83 x 0 + 19 x 5 + 40 x 2 + 96 x 2\n    which is 367 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 368. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 2, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 4, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 4, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 0 + 95 x 0 + 68 x 4 + 19 x 3 + 45 x 1\n    which is 374 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 375. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 3, 4, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [5, 4, 6, 4, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 4, 6, 4, 6]\n\n    What is your action?

My last counteroffer was highly advantageous for me but might not have been appealing enough for Player 2 based on the instant counter of offering all items to me.\n   - I must now propose a reasonable division that exceeds my outside offer but can still potentially be accepted by Player 2.  \n   - A practical counteroffer could include more equitable sharing yet remains favorable compared to my outside offer. \n\n**Calculating a New Counteroffer**:\n   - Aiming for a counter and evaluating what I retain is valued over 375:\n     - Offer [2, 1, 3, 3, 2] to Player 2.\n     - I would keep [3, 3, 3, 1, 4]:\n     - Value = (3 * 40) + (3 * 95) + (3 * 68) + (1 * 19) + (4 * 45) = 120 + 285 + 204 + 19 + 180 = 808.\n\n    This counteroffer gives me a value well above the threshold of my outside offer. \n\n**Final Decision**:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 708\n*   My values for the items: item 1 = 27, item 2 = 43, item 3 = 10, item 4 = 31, item 5 = 94\n*   Total items: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal reached in round 3 will be worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times the actual value, making it less desirable than a deal now (round 2) which would be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]. This means Player 1 is offering me:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 27 = 54\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 43 = 43\n    *   3 units of item 3: 3 * 10 = 30\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 31 = 93\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 94 = 188\n    *   Total value of current offer: 54 + 43 + 30 + 93 + 188 = 408\n\n*   Since 408 is less than my outside offer of 708, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 708. Let x = [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5] be the number of items I give to Player 1. Then I keep [5-x1, 4-x2, 6-x3, 4-x4, 6-x5]. The value I get from the counteroffer is (5-x1)*27 + (4-x2)*43 + (6-x3)*10 + (4-x4)*31 + (6-x5)*94. I need this to be greater than 708.\n\n    Let's try to give away as little as possible, starting with giving nothing to Player 1, so x = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The value to me would be 5*27 + 4*43 + 6*10 + 4*31 + 6*94 = 135 + 172 + 60 + 124 + 564 = 1055. Since this is the maximum possible value and is more than my outside offer, I could give away some items to Player 1 and still have the value of what remains be greater than 708.\n\n    Let's try offering Player 1 slightly more than their last offer while still maintaining a value above 708. Their last offer was [2, 1, 3, 3, 2], meaning I kept [3, 3, 3, 1, 4]. The value I kept was 3 * 27 + 3 * 43 + 3 * 10 + 1 * 31 + 4 * 94 = 81 + 129 + 30 + 31 + 376 = 647, which is less than 708.\n\n    Let's propose a counteroffer where I give Player 1 slightly less of item 5. I will offer them [2, 1, 3, 3, 1]. This means I keep [3, 3, 3, 1, 5]. The value is 3 * 27 + 3 * 43 + 3 * 10 + 1 * 31 + 5 * 94 = 81 + 129 + 30 + 31 + 470 = 741. This is greater than my outside offer of 708, so this counteroffer is better than walking away.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   A counteroffer of [2, 1, 3, 3, 1] yields a value of 741, which is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [2, 1, 3, 3, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 3, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 56 x 0 + 62 x 0 + 37 x 1\n    which is 37 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 52.

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 0, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 2 + 71 x 5 + 68 x 0 + 70 x 2 + 51 x 4\n    which is 745 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 746. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 258. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 39 x 1 + 75 x 0 + 7 x 3 + 49 x 4\n    which is 256 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 258. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

To reach a compromise, let's try offering half.\n    - The total pool of items is 3 + 8 + 0 + 3 + 4 = 18 items. We would like to divide it approximately half.\n    - If I offer them about half of items 1, 2, 4, and 5, this might be close to half of my total value.\n    - Let's try to offer: [1, 4, 0, 1, 2].\n    - If I offer that, my value will be (2*54) + (4*71) + (0*91) + (2*65) + (2*53) = 108 + 284 + 0 + 130 + 106 = 628.\n    - Since 628 is worse than my outside offer, I'll try offering them more.\n    - To ensure my offer is better than my outside offer value of 1000, I will offer to the other player the following [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1000. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1002 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 0, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 957.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 57, item 2 = 16, item 3 = 41, item 4 = 46, item 5 = 70.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9, meaning that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. My value would be:\n     (0 * 57) + (1 * 16) + (1 * 41) + (0 * 46) + (3 * 70) = 0 + 16 + 41 + 0 + 210 = 267.  The discounted value is 267 * 0.9 = 240.3.\n\n   - **Counteroffer Considerations:** I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer of 957.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (worth 240.3) is significantly less than my outside offer (957), I should not accept it. I also should not walk away, because there is one round of negotiations left. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer.\nTo determine a reasonable counteroffer, I will start by calculating the total value of all items to me:\n(4 * 57) + (4 * 16) + (5 * 41) + (5 * 46) + (6 * 70) = 228 + 64 + 205 + 230 + 420 = 1147.\nI want to keep enough items so that my value will be better than 957.\nLet's try to determine how much I need to give away in order to get Player 1 to accept.\n\nI will try offering [4, 1, 2, 2, 3]. This means I keep:\n0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\nMy value = (0 * 57) + (3 * 16) + (3 * 41) + (3 * 46) + (3 * 70) = 0 + 48 + 123 + 138 + 210 = 519.\nThis is no good. I will need to iterate.\n\nLet me calculate what would happen if I kept all of items 1, 3, 4, and 5, and gave all the item 2s.\nIf I offer Player 1 [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], then I keep [4, 0, 5, 5, 6]\nMy value is (4 * 57) + (0 * 16) + (5 * 41) + (5 * 46) + (6 * 70) = 228 + 0 + 205 + 230 + 420 = 1083.\nThis is better than my outside option.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 5, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 72 x 1 + 48 x 4 + 24 x 5 + 40 x 6\n    which is 624 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 627.

Thus, any deal's value will be multiplied by 0.81 to reflect the current round's outcome.\n\n2) **Assess Offer Values:**\n   - **Current Offer on the Table:** [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n     - My value if I accept it:\n       \\[\n       0 \\times 32 + 4 \\times 72 + 0 \\times 48 + 0 \\times 24 + 0 \\times 40 = 288\n       \\]\n     - Adjusted for round 3 discount: \\(288 \\times 0.81 = 233.28\\)\n   - **Comparison with Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 627, which is significantly higher than 233.28. Accepting this offer is not advisable as it's much lower than my guaranteed fallback.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - **Should I Accept the Current Offer?** No, because 233.28 is less than my outside offer of 627.\n   - **Should I Walk Away?** Walking away means taking my outside offer of 627, which is better than the current offer.\n   - **Does a Counteroffer Make Sense?** Since it's round 3, Player 2 can't respond with a counteroffer, so any further negotiation attempt would be futile. If the current offer isn't better than my outside offer, it makes sense to walk away.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best course of action is to walk away since my outside offer of 627 is more valuable than the offer currently on the table (233.28).\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "To address this negotiation scenario, it is essential to carefully consider the value of each potential move by comparing it with my outside offer of 661. Here is the step-by-step analysis for making a decision:\n\n1) First, analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 661.\n   - My values for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 49\n     - Item 2: 16\n     - Item 3: 3\n     - Item 4: 60\n     - Item 5: 78\n   - Total units of each item available:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - As this is a three-round negotiation with a discount factor, delaying the conclusion reduces the present value for both parties. Therefore, securing a deal with a present value close to or exceeding my outside offer would be wise.\n\n2) Assess the value of potential offers:\n   - Since there is currently no offer from Player 2, I should calculate potential counteroffers that would yield a value greater than my outside offer.\n   - I need to configure a counteroffer in which what I retain provides a value higher than 661. \n\n   Let's start with a scenario where I try to retain enough value for a better offer:\n   - Proposal: [0, 3, 4, 0, 0] (meaning I keep: [2-0, 5-3, 5-4, 3-0, 4-0] = [2, 2, 1, 3, 4])\n     - Value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 2 units * 49 = 98\n       - Item 2: 2 units * 16 = 32\n       - Item 3: 1 unit * 3 = 3\n       - Item 4: 3 units * 60 = 180\n       - Item 5: 4 units * 78 = 312\n     - Total value for me = 98 + 32 + 3 + 180 + 312 = 625\n\n   Here, the total value of 625 is still less than my outside offer of 661. Therefore, I need to adjust the proposal for more retention.\n\n   - Proposal 2: [0, 3, 3, 0, 1] (meaning I keep: [2-0, 5-3, 5-3, 3-0, 4-1] = [2, 2, 2, 3, 3])\n     - Value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 2 units * 49 = 98\n       - Item 2: 2 units * 16 = 32\n       - Item 3: 2 units * 3 = 6\n       - Item 4: 3 units * 60 = 180\n       - Item 5: 3 units * 78 = 234\n     - Total value for me = 98 + 32 + 6 + 180 + 234 = 550 (still insufficient)\n\n   It seems challenging to configure an offer that beats 661 directly without keeping more.\n\n   Analyzing each case, the division providing over 661 is harder without overly restraining Player 2 unless taking more drastic retention:\n\nLet's consider the closest scenario:\n- Proposal 3: [0, 2, 3, 0, 1] (keeping [2, 3, 2, 3, 3])\n   - Value calculation:\n     - Item 1: 2 * 49 = 98\n     - Item 2: 3 * 16 = 48\n     - Item 3: 2 * 3 = 6\n     - Item 4: 3 * 60 = 180\n     - Item 5: 3 * 78 = 234\n   - Total value for me = 98 + 48 + 6 + 180 + 234 = 566 (again, not good enough)\n\nGiven my outside offer is particularly high, let's:\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Given I can't derive a split in round 1 to exceed my outside offer and avoid suboptimal paths, walking remains optimal.\n   - Therefore, it's logical to conclude that I should walk away as my outside offer (661) is significant and I cannot achieve better in this setting.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted in the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer on the table (what I receive): [1, 1, 3, 1, 3]\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 70) + (1 * 82) + (3 * 3) + (1 * 21) + (3 * 41) = 70 + 82 + 9 + 21 + 123 = 305\n*   Since the current offer's value (305) is less than my outside offer (589), accepting is not a good idea.\n\nNow, let's consider a few potential counteroffers and their values:\n\n*   The total number of items are [3, 2, 9, 3, 6].

The value of this allocation to me is (2 * 70) + (1 * 82) + (6 * 3) + (2 * 21) + (3 * 41) = 140 + 82 + 18 + 42 + 123 = 405.\n*  If I were to offer Player 1 nothing: keep [3, 2, 9, 3, 6].

I keep [3, 2, 9, 3, 4]: Value = (3 * 70) + (2 * 82) + (9 * 3) + (3 * 21) + (4 * 41) = 210 + 164 + 27 + 63 + 164 = 628\n* Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. I keep [3, 2, 9, 3, 5]: Value = (3 * 70) + (2 * 82) + (9 * 3) + (3 * 21) + (5 * 41) = 210 + 164 + 27 + 63 + 205 = 669\n\nLet's try offering more of Item 2.\n\n* Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. I keep [3, 1, 9, 3, 6]: Value = (3 * 70) + (1 * 82) + (9 * 3) + (3 * 21) + (6 * 41) = 210 + 82 + 27 + 63 + 246 = 628\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is far below my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 589. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 589. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 3, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 3 + 82 x 2 + 3 x 3 + 21 x 0 + 41 x 5\n    which is 588 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 589. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 30. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 5 x 5 + 42 x 0 + 34 x 0\n    which is 25 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 30. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means accepting an offer in later rounds is less valuable than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 8, 0, 5]. This means they are giving me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n    *   (0 * 77) + (0 * 95) + (8 * 69) + (0 * 34) + (5 * 50) = 0 + 0 + 552 + 0 + 250 = 802\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** 802 < 1019. Accepting the current offer would give me less value than my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider a potential counteroffer. I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value of 1019. Since it is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so I don't need to consider the discount rate at the moment.\n\nI have:\nitem 1: 2 units at 77 each\nitem 2: 3 units at 95 each\nitem 3: 8 units at 69 each\nitem 4: 1 unit at 34 each\nitem 5: 5 units at 50 each\n\nLet's try keeping all of items 1, 2, and 5.\n2 * 77 + 3 * 95 + 5 * 50 = 154 + 285 + 250 = 689.\nThen, I need 1019 - 689 = 330 more in value.\nI have 8 units of item 3 valued at 69 each, so if I keep 5 of them, I get 5 * 69 = 345, which is over the needed 330. I have 1 unit of item 4 valued at 34.\n\nTherefore, let's try to keep:\nitem 1: 2\nitem 2: 3\nitem 3: 5\nitem 4: 1\nitem 5: 5\nThat gives me a total value of 2 * 77 + 3 * 95 + 5 * 69 + 1 * 34 + 5 * 50 = 154 + 285 + 345 + 34 + 250 = 1068\n\nSo I give:\nitem 1: 0\nitem 2: 0\nitem 3: 3\nitem 4: 0\nitem 5: 0\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (802) is worse than my outside offer (1019), I should not accept it.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 372. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1083 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 4 + 77 x 1 + 58 x 1 + 72 x 0 + 95 x 0\n    which is 371 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 372. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 0 + 10 x 3 + 48 x 2 + 72 x 2 + 71 x 3\n    which is 483 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 484. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means an offer accepted later is worth less to me now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am offered [2, 3, 1, 1, 3].

To avoid mistake #2, I need to calculate total value to me, to ensure its over 711.\n   - Let's consider giving Player 1 half of everything, rounded up for items with odd numbers. That means I offer Player 1 [2, 3, 2, 2, 3].\n   - If I offer [2, 3, 2, 2, 3], I keep [2, 3, 2, 1, 3].\n   - My value would be: 2*25 + 3*60 + 2*12 + 1*15 + 3*86 = 50 + 180 + 24 + 15 + 258 = 527.

However, considering this is only round 1, the immediate impact of this factor is minimal.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table from Player 2.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I want to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my return while being fair to the other player. Let's examine some possibilities:\n\n  - **Keep Most Valuable Items While Ensuring Value Above Outside Offer**:\n\n    Example offer to Player 2: [3, 0, 2, 0, 4], keeping for myself [0, 1, 2, 1, 2].\n\n    Calculating its total value to me:\n    - My value from keeping: \n      - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 25 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 2 = 38\n      - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n      - 1 unit of item 4 = 24\n      - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n    - Total value = 176\n\n  Since the total value of keeping for myself (176) is significantly higher than my outside offer of 29, this is a beneficial counteroffer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven this analysis, I will propose a counteroffer, as it significantly exceeds my outside offer value and accommodates a good starting point for negotiation.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 316. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 316. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 564 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 1 + 59 x 1 + 14 x 3 + 41 x 1 + 33 x 4\n    which is 315 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 316. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 94. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1032 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 57 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 84 x 1\n    which is 84 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 94. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The discount factor reduces the value of future deals.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 2, 4, 3, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units * 47 = 94\n    *   Item 2: 2 units * 100 = 200\n    *   Item 3: 4 units * 7 = 28\n    *   Item 4: 3 units * 16 = 48\n    *   Item 5: 0 units * 62 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 94 + 200 + 28 + 48 + 0 = 370\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (370) is much less than my outside offer (690). Accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is both better than my outside offer AND reasonable enough for Player 1 to potentially accept. Since Player 1 offered [2, 2, 4, 3, 0] to me, they are keeping [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. I should try to come up with an offer where I keep more of the valuable items (items 2 and 5), and offer Player 1 more of the less valuable ones (item 3).\n\nLet's try an offer where I give Player 1 [1, 1, 3, 1, 0]. This means I would keep [3, 3, 3, 4, 2]. The value of this offer to me would be:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units * 47 = 141\n*   Item 2: 3 units * 100 = 300\n*   Item 3: 3 units * 7 = 21\n*   Item 4: 4 units * 16 = 64\n*   Item 5: 2 units * 62 = 124\n*   Total value = 141 + 300 + 21 + 64 + 124 = 650\n\nStill lower than my outside offer. Let's try an offer where I give Player 1 [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]. This means I would keep [3, 4, 3, 5, 2]. The value of this offer to me would be:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units * 47 = 141\n*   Item 2: 4 units * 100 = 400\n*   Item 3: 3 units * 7 = 21\n*   Item 4: 5 units * 16 = 80\n*   Item 5: 2 units * 62 = 124\n*   Total value = 141 + 400 + 21 + 80 + 124 = 766\n\nThis is better than my outside offer. Let's consider one last offer for now, giving Player 1 only one unit of item 3, so Player 1 gets [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would keep [4, 4, 5, 5, 2]. The value of this offer to me would be:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 units * 47 = 188\n*   Item 2: 4 units * 100 = 400\n*   Item 3: 5 units * 7 = 35\n*   Item 4: 5 units * 16 = 80\n*   Item 5: 2 units * 62 = 124\n*   Total value = 188 + 400 + 35 + 80 + 124 = 827\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is much worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept it. The offer [1, 0, 3, 0, 0] gives me 766, and the offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] gives me 827.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 2 + 100 x 4 + 7 x 1 + 16 x 4 + 62 x 2\n    which is 689 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 690. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 4, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 3, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 690\n*   My item values: item 1 = 47, item 2 = 100, item 3 = 7, item 4 = 16, item 5 = 62\n*   Total items: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer now is worth more than the same offer next round (value is multiplied by 0.9 each round).\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer and potential counteroffers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 1, 3, 2, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Total value: (2 * 47) + (3 * 100) + (3 * 7) + (3 * 16) + (2 * 62) = 94 + 300 + 21 + 48 + 124 = 587\n\n*   Since 587 is less than my outside offer of 690, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a few potential counteroffers to see if we can improve upon this. I should make sure my counteroffer results in keeping items whose total value exceeds 690. I am trying to find amounts to offer the other player such that what I keep is greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try an offer where I keep all of item 2 and most of item 5 and item 1:\nOffer: [1, 0, 6, 5, 0] - This keeps:\nItem 1: 4 - 1 = 3\nItem 2: 4 - 0 = 4\nItem 3: 6 - 6 = 0\nItem 4: 5 - 5 = 0\nItem 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n\nValue: 3 * 47 + 4 * 100 + 0 * 7 + 0 * 16 + 2 * 62 = 141 + 400 + 0 + 0 + 124 = 665. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nOffer: [0, 0, 6, 5, 0] - This keeps:\nItem 1: 4 - 0 = 4\nItem 2: 4 - 0 = 4\nItem 3: 6 - 6 = 0\nItem 4: 5 - 5 = 0\nItem 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n\nValue: 4 * 47 + 4 * 100 + 0 * 7 + 0 * 16 + 2 * 62 = 188 + 400 + 0 + 0 + 124 = 712. This is greater than my outside offer, so this counteroffer is better than walking away.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is bad for me. I should not accept it. My counteroffer of [0, 0, 6, 5, 0] is greater than my outside offer, so it is a viable option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 5, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 0 + 83 x 0 + 40 x 4 + 24 x 0 + 41 x 2\n    which is 242 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 243. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To effectively decide on the best course of action, let's break down the information and assess the current situation:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is valued at 79.\n- **Values of Items Involved**:\n  - Item 1: 69\n  - Item 2: 34\n  - Item 3: 64\n  - Item 4: 37\n  - Item 5: 91\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The negotiation lasts for 3 rounds with a discount factor (gamma) of 0.9. The value of the outcome will be multiplied by this factor raised to the power of (r-1), where r is the current round. However, since this is the first round, the discount factor is not yet affecting our decision (gamma^0 = 1).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: None yet, so I start by determining what counteroffers make sense.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - Ideally, a counteroffer should ensure that the value I keep is greater than my outside offer value of 79.\n\n#### Calculating Offer Values:\n\nI\u2019ll explore a few potential offers:\n1. **Offer [2, 4, 4, 2, 2]**: I keep nothing, yielding me no value \u2014 not acceptable.\n2. **Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**: I keep everything:\n   - Value = (2x69) + (4x34) + (4x64) + (2x37) + (2x91) = 786 \u2014 Ideal, but unlikely to be accepted by Player 2.\n\n3. **Balanced Offer [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]**:\n   - I keep: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - Value to me = (1x69) + (2x34) + (2x64) + (1x37) + (1x91) = 69 + 68 + 128 + 37 + 91 = 393. This value is more than five times my outside offer, but if I propose this offer, Player 2 might not accept it as it allows me to secure a substantial portion of value.\n\n4. **Reasonable Offer [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]**:\n   - I keep: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - Value = (1x69) + (1x34) + (1x64) + (1x37) + (1x91) = 69 + 34 + 64 + 37 + 91 = 295. This is still far above my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\nBased on these calculations, I\u2019ll propose an offer that ensures I receive a value significantly above my outside offer but still potentially appealing to Player 2. Keeping 1 unit of highly valuable items like item 3 and item 5 can maximize my retained value.\n\nMy initial **counteroffer** will therefore be to offer Player 2 [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]}\n```\n\nThis offer allows Player 2 to have a reasonable share while ensuring my value from the negotiation remains notably higher than simply accepting the outside offer.",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 409. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 409. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 36 x 4 + 53 x 3 + 63 x 1 + 20 x 2\n    which is 406 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 409. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 409.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 53, item 2 = 36, item 3 = 53, item 4 = 63, item 5 = 20.\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1\n      - 3 units of item 2\n      - 3 units of item 3\n      - 1 unit of item 4\n      - 1 unit of item 5\n      My value for this offer would be: (1 * 53) + (3 * 36) + (3 * 53) + (1 * 63) + (1 * 20) = 53 + 108 + 159 + 63 + 20 = 403.\n      Since 403 < 409 (my outside offer), accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer for me. I also need to consider what Player 1 might accept. I have to give the counteroffer (what Player 1 receives).\n      - Let's consider keeping [2, 4, 4, 2, 2] which means I'd offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This has value 2*53 + 4*36 + 4*53 + 2*63 + 2*20 = 106 + 144 + 212 + 126 + 40 = 628. Since this offers the other player nothing, this is likely Mistake 3.\n      -Let's try an offer where I keep only [1, 2, 2, 1, 1] and offer [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]. 1*53 + 2*36 + 2*53 + 1*63 + 1*20 = 53 + 72 + 106 + 63 + 20 = 314. This is too low, so I'll keep more.\n      -Let's try an offer where I keep [2, 3, 3, 2, 2] and offer [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]. 0*53 + 1*36 + 1*53 + 0*63 + 0*20 = 0 + 36 + 53 + 0 + 0 = 89. This is too low a counteroffer.\n\n      I need to find a counteroffer that's better than 409. I'm offering them [1,3,3,1,1], so they have 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n      I will keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. I will offer [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]. My value is 53 + 36 + 53 + 63 + 20 = 225. This is far too low, indicating I should be receiving the offer.\n\nI need an offer that's better than my outside option, so it needs to be valued at more than 409.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I give them slightly less: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]. That means I keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] with value 2 * 53 + 2 * 36 + 2 * 53 + 2 * 63 + 2 * 20 = 106 + 72 + 106 + 126 + 40 = 450 > 409. Player 1 gets 0, 2, 2, 0, 0.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer. My counteroffer will be to give Player 1 [0, 2, 2, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 128. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 381 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 1 + 14 x 1 + 6 x 0 + 85 x 1 + 6 x 2\n    which is 127 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 128. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Therefore, accepting this offer would not be optimal.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer's discounted value (101.7) is less than my outside offer (128).\n   - A counteroffer must provide value greater than 128 to be better than my outside offer.\n\n**Counteroffer Analysis:**\n- To ensure the counteroffer provides a value higher than 128, let's test a configuration:\n  - If I keep [2, 2, 2, 3, 3] and offer the rest, i.e., [2, 0, 1, 1, 0].\n  - My kept values:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 16 = 32\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 14 = 28\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 6 = 12\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 85 = 255\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 6 = 18\n    - Total Value = 32 + 28 + 12 + 255 + 18 = 345\n    - Discounted Value = 345 * 0.9 = 310.5\n- This offer gives me a higher discounted value than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I propose a counteroffer to maximize my value. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 1 + 18 x 1 + 45 x 2 + 77 x 1 + 62 x 1\n    which is 319 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 320. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 320.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 72, item 2 = 18, item 3 = 45, item 4 = 77, item 5 = 62.\n*   Total items: 4 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less. Specifically, accepting in round 2 means the value is multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 1, 1, 0].  This means I would get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 72 = 144\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 18 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 62 = 0\n    *   Total value = 144 + 0 + 45 + 77 + 0 = 266\n    *   Discounted value = 266 * 0.9 = 239.4\n\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is worth 320.\n\n*   **Previous Offer Analysis:** In round 1, I offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1. This means I kept:\n    * 3 units of item 1: 3 * 72 = 216\n    * 2 units of item 2: 2 * 18 = 36\n    * 2 units of item 3: 2 * 45 = 90\n    * 3 units of item 4: 3 * 77 = 231\n    * 2 units of item 5: 2 * 62 = 124\n    * Total value = 216 + 36 + 90 + 231 + 124 = 697. Discounted value = 697 * 0.9 = 627.3\n\n*   **Player 1's previous offer to me**: In round 1, Player 1 offered me [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This means I would get:\n    * 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 72 = 72\n    * 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 18 = 18\n    * 2 unit of item 3: 2 * 45 = 90\n    * 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 62 = 62\n    * Total value = 72 + 18 + 90 + 77 + 62 = 319. Discounted value = 319 * 0.9 = 287.1\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer (discounted value of 239.4) is worse than my outside offer (320).\n*   The Player 1's previous offer (discounted value of 287.1) is worse than my outside offer (320).\n*   My previous offer (discounted value of 627.3) is better than my outside offer (320).\n\nTherefore, I should try to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. Player 1 seems to value item 1, item 4, and item 5 more, based on the fact that they didn't give any up in the current offer. Player 2 seems to not care as much for item 2.\n\nLet's propose the following counteroffer: Give player 1 1 unit of item 1, all 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This means I would keep:\n\n* 3 units of item 1: 3 * 72 = 216\n* 0 units of item 2: 0 * 18 = 0\n* 2 units of item 3: 2 * 45 = 90\n* 3 units of item 4: 3 * 77 = 231\n* 3 units of item 5: 3 * 62 = 186\n* Total value = 216 + 0 + 90 + 231 + 186 = 723\n* Discounted value = 723 * 0.9 = 650.7\n\nThis is better than my outside offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 3 + 20 x 1 + 72 x 1 + 73 x 0 + 95 x 2\n    which is 423 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 424. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 309. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 429 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 0 + 25 x 0 + 27 x 1 + 18 x 2 + 49 x 5\n    which is 308 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 309. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

We are in round 1, so the discount factor does not yet apply.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n- Since there is no current offer from Player 2, I need to consider possible counteroffers that can satisfy my value need.\n  \n  - If I propose an initial offer where I keep some items with a total value of more than 309, I should check those calculations. I'll try to find a balance where I keep items totaling at least 310+ (since 309 is my fallback), to maximize my value.\n\n- Consider an offer where I propose something that leaves me with a value higher than the outside offer. Let's calculate potential divisions:\n\n  - Let's say I keep 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Calculate the value:\n  \n    - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n    - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 25 = 100\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 27 = 27\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n    - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n  \n  Total value of what I keep: 48 + 100 + 27 + 18 + 147 = 340\n\n  Since 340 is greater than the outside offer of 309, this division leaves me with a better value than my fallback position.\n\n  Proposed counteroffer to Player 2: I give 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\n**3) Make a Decision:**\n\n- Based on the above analysis, I will make a counteroffer because it provides a value for me greater than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 366. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 366. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 522 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 1, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 1 + 13 x 4 + 5 x 1 + 60 x 2 + 46 x 3\n    which is 365 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 366. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 366. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 522 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 1, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 1 + 13 x 4 + 5 x 1 + 60 x 2 + 46 x 3\n    which is 365 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 366. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 302. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 0 + 29 x 1 + 69 x 0 + 98 x 2 + 19 x 4\n    which is 301 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 302. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

Specifically, if we make it to round 3 the overall value of the outcome to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - The current offer on the table is [0, 1, 0, 0, 2], meaning I receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - My value for accepting the current offer:\n     (0 * 50) + (1 * 44) + (0 * 77) + (0 * 66) + (2 * 47) = 0 + 44 + 0 + 0 + 94 = 138\n   - Since 138 is much less than my outside offer of 580, I should not accept this offer.\n   - Let's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while being realistic about what Player 1 might accept. Also, the discounting factor is important to consider, as is the fact that if I make a counteroffer this round and it isn't accepted then this will be treated as a walk.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - Let's try to make a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer. I currently have 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n   - Previous offers:\n     - Round 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 3], I offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].

This leaves me with [2, 2, 1, 0, 2].\nMy value would then be:\n(2 * 50) + (2 * 44) + (1 * 77) + (0 * 66) + (2 * 47) = 100 + 88 + 77 + 0 + 94 = 359\nSince 359 < 580, this is not a good offer for me.\n\nLet's try offering the following to Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This leaves me with [3, 3, 1, 0, 3].\nMy value would then be:\n(3 * 50) + (3 * 44) + (1 * 77) + (0 * 66) + (3 * 47) = 150 + 132 + 77 + 0 + 141 = 500\nSince 500 < 580, this is not a good offer for me.\n\nSince this is round 2, I don't want to risk receiving nothing in round 3 after discounting.\n\nI need to make a decision: I will make a counteroffer slightly better than my outside offer. I want to keep most of the items. I will offer Player 1 [1,0,0,0,0].\n\nThis gives me a value of: \n(3 * 50) + (3 * 44) + (1 * 77) + (0 * 66) + (4 * 47) = 150 + 132 + 77 + 0 + 188 = 547\nHowever, I also need to consider the discount factor if it makes it to round 3:\n547 * 0.81 = 443.07\n\nI believe I will WALK, as any acceptable offer would likely be rejected by Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 3 + 57 x 4 + 22 x 0 + 66 x 1 + 100 x 0\n    which is 390 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 392. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 416. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 416. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1098 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 0 + 84 x 0 + 95 x 1 + 92 x 2 + 68 x 2\n    which is 415 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 416. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This means offers in later rounds are worth less to me now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am being offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  The total value to me is: (0 * 27) + (2 * 84) + (2 * 95) + (0 * 92) + (0 * 68) = 0 + 168 + 190 + 0 + 0 = 358.\n   - Comparing to outside offer: The current offer (358) is less than my outside offer (416).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer (358) is worse than walking away (416).\n   - I should either walk away or make a counteroffer. Since it's round 1, making a counteroffer is probably better than walking away immediately. Let's aim for a counteroffer that gives me more than 416.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep all of item 4 and item 5, 1 of item 3 and item 1, and 0 of item 2.\nThat means I offer Player 1: 0 item 1, 2 item 2, 1 item 3, 0 item 4, 0 item 5\n\nValue calculation if I keep:\n1 item 1: 1 * 27 = 27\n0 item 2: 0 * 84 = 0\n1 item 3: 1 * 95 = 95\n3 item 4: 3 * 92 = 276\n6 item 5: 6 * 68 = 408\nTotal value = 27 + 0 + 95 + 276 + 408 = 806\n\nNow, let me check what my value would be if I ask for 1 of each item.\nI keep 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4, 1 item 5.\nI offer to Player 1: 0 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 2 item 4, 5 item 5.\n\nMy value: 1*27 + 1*84 + 1*95 + 1*92 + 1*68 = 27 + 84 + 95 + 92 + 68 = 366. This is lower than my outside offer, so it will be a bad counter offer.\n\nLet's try keeping all of item 4 and all of item 5, and nothing else.\n\n3*92 + 6*68 = 276 + 408 = 684.\n\nI can offer all of item 1, all of item 2 and all of item 3 to Player 1.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 50. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 591 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 0 + 69 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 5 x 2 + 37 x 1\n    which is 47 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 50. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This applies if we reach further rounds, reducing the effective value of future negotiations.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I need to propose the initial offer. I need to calculate different scenarios and check their values against my outside offer value of 606 to avoid Mistake 2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer).\n\n#### Evaluating Different Offers:\n\n1. **Maximum Value if I keep everything**:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 11 + 1 \\times 43 + 4 \\times 60 + 1 \\times 79 + 6 \\times 97 = 955\n   \\]\n   This scenario is impossible because I need to offer something to player 2.\n\n2. **Balanced Offer - Example**:\n   - Offer Player 2: \\([0, 0, 2, 0, 3]\\), meaning I keep \\([1, 1, 2, 1, 3]\\)\n   - Value to me:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 11 + 1 \\times 43 + 2 \\times 60 + 1 \\times 79 + 3 \\times 97 = 636\n   \\]\n   This value (636) is greater than my outside offer value of 606.\n\n3. **Alternative Offer - Example**:\n   - Offer Player 2: \\([0, 0, 1, 0, 4]\\), meaning I keep \\([1, 1, 3, 1, 2]\\)\n   - Value to me:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 11 + 1 \\times 43 + 3 \\times 60 + 1 \\times 79 + 2 \\times 97 = 703\n   \\]\n   This value (703) is significantly greater than my outside offer value of 606.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nI should offer a division that gives me a total value significantly above my outside offer of 606. I will proceed with the second alternative offer:\n\n- I propose offering \\([0, 0, 1, 0, 4]\\) to Player 2, meaning I keep \\([1, 1, 3, 1, 2]\\).\n\nThis counteroffer ensures I avoid Mistake 2 and aligns with my objective to maximize my payoff.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 4]}\n```",

This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My value for this offer is: 0 * 44 + 0 * 7 + 0 * 46 + 0 * 8 + 2 * 11 = 22.\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** The current offer (22) is much worse than my outside offer (365).\n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer where I keep a significant amount of the items. I have a total value of 561. My outside offer is 365. That means I need to keep items that are worth at least that amount to me to make this worthwhile.\n\nLet's consider keeping all of item 1 (5 * 44 = 220), all of item 3 (5 * 46 = 230) and all of item 5 (8 * 11 = 88). This totals 538. This alone is better than offering all of items 2 and 4 to Player 1 as they do not have much value.\n\nI think I should propose an aggressive counteroffer to try and secure more value. I will offer the other player only the items I don't value that much to keep me above the value of my outside offer.\n\nI will offer Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This leaves me with: 5 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 8 units of item 5.\nMy total value: 5 * 44 + 0 * 7 + 5 * 46 + 0 * 8 + 8 * 11 = 220 + 0 + 230 + 0 + 88 = 538.\nThis offer to Player 1 has a value to me of 7+16 = 23.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer. Therefore, I should not accept. I also should not walk away, as there are future rounds to negotiate and I can try to get a better deal. I should make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 673. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 576 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 5, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 5 + 51 x 1 + 57 x 5 + 31 x 2 + 24 x 5\n    which is 663 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 673. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This is round 2, thus the overall value of the agreement from my perspective should be considered as \\( \\text{Value} \\times (0.9)^{(2-1)} = \\text{Value} \\times 0.9 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer (to me):** [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n  - My value from this offer = \\(0 \\times 29 + 1 \\times 51 + 0 \\times 57 + 2 \\times 31 + 0 \\times 24\\)\n  - Total value = \\(0 + 51 + 0 + 62 + 0 = 113\\)\n  - Adjusted for the discount: \\(113 \\times 0.9 = 101.7\\)\n\nSince 101.7 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 673, this is not an advantageous offer for me to accept.\n\n- **Counteroffer potential value analysis:**\n  - I need to consider a division strategy where the part I keep should have a value greater than 673.\n  - Example hypothetical offering: If I keep all items [5, 0, 5, 0, 8], my value would be:\n    - \\(5 \\times 29 + 0 \\times 51 + 5 \\times 57 + 0 \\times 31 + 8 \\times 24\\)\n    - Total value = \\(145 + 0 + 285 + 0 + 192 = 622\\)\n    - Even with no discount, this is below 673, so I need to retain more high-value items or adjust the distribution.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **Accepting** the current offer would be significantly less than my outside offer (101.7 < 673).\n- **Walking away** would guarantee I get the outside offer value of 673.\n- Formulating a new **counteroffer** where the value to me exceeds 673 without discounting at this point in negotiations.\n\nGiven my high outside offer, and considering the current inadequate offer, it appears challenging to generate a valid counteroffer that could yield a better result without knowing Player 2's outside offer. However, the best attempt can involve securing the high-value item 2 or 3 entirely for myself since these contribute most to my payoff. \n\nA potential counteroffer that's worth attempting:\n\n- Offer player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] (I give player 2 4 units of item 5)\n\nWhat I keep: [5, 1, 5, 2, 4]\n- Value: \\(5 \\times 29 + 1 \\times 51 + 5 \\times 57 + 2 \\times 31 + 4 \\times 24 = 725\\), which is more than my outside offer.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 673. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 576 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 5, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 5 + 51 x 1 + 57 x 5 + 31 x 2 + 24 x 5\n    which is 663 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 673. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 6, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 1 + 89 x 0 + 30 x 6 + 81 x 3 + 51 x 0\n    which is 436 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 437. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 3, 5, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 1 + 25 x 3 + 19 x 3 + 53 x 5 + 28 x 6\n    which is 600 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 601. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

For instance:\n\n     Let's calculate for keeping more items for myself and checking how that compares:\n     - If I keep 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5:\n       - \\(4 \\times 35 + 3 \\times 25 + 2 \\times 19 + 4 \\times 53 + 5 \\times 28 = 140 + 75 + 38 + 212 + 140 = 605\\).\n\n   The calculated value of 605 is slightly above my outside offer of 601, suggesting it would be an advantageous proposal for me.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - I should propose a counteroffer where I keep items as calculated to give me a total value above my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 824. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1044 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 4, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 1 + 80 x 3 + 94 x 4 + 84 x 0 + 38 x 4\n    which is 820 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 824. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n    - My outside offer value is 824.\n    - My values for the items are: item 1 = 52, item 2 = 80, item 3 = 94, item 4 = 84, item 5 = 38.\n    - The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n    - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 2, 2, 0, 2]. This means I would receive:\n        - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 52 = 156\n        - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 80 = 160\n        - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 94 = 188\n        - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 84 = 0\n        - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 38 = 76\n        - Total value of current offer: 156 + 160 + 188 + 0 + 76 = 580\n    - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (580) is less than my outside offer (824).  Therefore, accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to propose an offer that gives me a value greater than 824. I need to determine how much to offer the other player to achieve this. Let's consider keeping the following items:\n        - 4 units of item 1: 4 * 52 = 208\n        - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 80 = 240\n        - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 94 = 282\n        - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 84 = 0\n        - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 38 = 114\n        - Total value : 208 + 240 + 282 + 0 + 114 = 844\n\n    Which means I would offer them:\n        - 2 units of item 1\n        - 1 units of item 2\n        - 1 units of item 3\n        - 0 units of item 4\n        - 1 units of item 5\n\n    Let's also consider keeping the following items:\n        - 5 units of item 1: 5 * 52 = 260\n        - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 80 = 240\n        - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 94 = 282\n        - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 84 = 0\n        - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 38 = 114\n        - Total value : 260 + 240 + 282 + 0 + 114 = 896\n\n    Which means I would offer them:\n        - 1 units of item 1\n        - 1 units of item 2\n        - 1 units of item 3\n        - 0 units of item 4\n        - 1 units of item 5\n\n    Let's propose this last offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n      - Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n      - Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n      - Item 4: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n      - Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n   - My value from accepting the current offer: (4 * 52) + (2 * 80) + (2 * 94) + (0 * 84) + (2 * 38) = 208 + 160 + 188 + 0 + 76 = 632\n   - Since it is round 2, the discounted value would be 632 * 0.9^(2-1) = 632 * 0.9 = 568.8\n   - 568.8 < 824, so accepting the current offer would be a mistake.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 824, adjusted for the discount factor. Let's consider some scenarios.  I need to keep enough items to have a value > 824/0.9 = 915.56\n   - Let me try keeping [4, 3, 3, 0, 3].  This gives me 52*4 + 80*3 + 94*3 + 84*0 + 38*3 = 208 + 240 + 282 + 0 + 114 = 844. Which is < 915.56\n   - Let me try keeping [5, 3, 3, 0, 3]. This gives me 52*5 + 80*3 + 94*3 + 84*0 + 38*3 = 260 + 240 + 282 + 0 + 114 = 896. Which is < 915.56\n   - Let me try keeping [5, 4, 3, 0, 3]. This gives me 52*5 + 80*4 + 94*3 + 84*0 + 38*3 = 260 + 320 + 282 + 0 + 114 = 976. Which is > 915.56. This is possible. Then I am offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n   - Let me try keeping [5, 4, 4, 0, 3]. This gives me 52*5 + 80*4 + 94*4 + 84*0 + 38*3 = 260 + 320 + 376 + 0 + 114 = 1070. This is possible. Then I am offering [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n   - Let me try keeping [6, 4, 4, 0, 4]. This gives me 52*6 + 80*4 + 94*4 + 84*0 + 38*4 = 312 + 320 + 376 + 0 + 152 = 1160. This is possible. Then I am offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is bad. My outside offer is better.\n   - I need to make a counteroffer to have a discounted value better than my outside offer.\n   - Offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] would give me a value of 976.\n   - The discounted value of offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] to Player 1 is 976*0.9 = 878.4, which is greater than 824.\n   - So, offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] is the optimal solution.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Since we are in round 3, if I accept the current offer, my value will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 2, 2, 0, 2]. This means I would get 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n        *   Value of current offer: (3 * 52) + (2 * 80) + (2 * 94) + (0 * 84) + (2 * 38) = 156 + 160 + 188 + 0 + 76 = 580.\n        *   Discounted value of current offer: 580 * 0.81 = 469.8\n    *   Since the discounted value of the current offer (469.8) is much less than my outside offer (824), accepting is not a good idea.\n    *   Let's consider walking away. If I walk away, I get my outside offer of 824.\n    *   Now I want to evaluate a counteroffer. To craft a counteroffer, I need to consider how to get a value higher than my outside offer. I need to keep enough items such that their value, discounted, exceeds 824.\n    *   To do that, I will calculate what items I need to keep to get a value greater than or equal to my outside offer divided by the discount factor.\n    *   That is, Value >= 824 / 0.81 = 1017.28\n    *   This will give the lowest value for the offer I can give.\n\nHere's the maximum value I can extract from each type of good:\n* Item 1: 6 * 52 = 312\n* Item 2: 4 * 80 = 320\n* Item 3: 4 * 94 = 376\n* Item 4: 0 * 84 = 0\n* Item 5: 4 * 38 = 152\n\nLet's attempt to see if I can do better than the outside offer. The current round is 3. So the value I must get from a deal must be greater than 824/0.81 = 1017.28. This means I must construct a counteroffer such that the items I KEEP are worth more than 1017.28.\n\nLet's try to see if keeping all the items results in a better outcome: (6 * 52) + (4 * 80) + (4 * 94) + (0 * 84) + (4 * 38) = 312 + 320 + 376 + 0 + 152 = 1160. Since 1160 * 0.81 = 939.6 > 824, keeping all items is better than walking away. Thus, giving all the items to player 1 is undesirable.\n\nLet's try the counteroffer I made in Round 2: offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 1].\nIf I offer player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], then I keep [5, 4, 3, 0, 3].\nMy value is: (5 * 52) + (4 * 80) + (3 * 94) + (0 * 84) + (3 * 38) = 260 + 320 + 282 + 0 + 114 = 976. 976 * 0.81 = 790.56 < 824. This is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\nI keep [6, 4, 4, 0, 4]. My value: (6 * 52) + (4 * 80) + (4 * 94) + (0 * 84) + (4 * 38) = 312 + 320 + 376 + 0 + 152 = 1160. 1160 * 0.81 = 939.6 > 824.\nTherefore, offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is better than walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 2 + 93 x 0 + 5 x 1 + 69 x 0 + 40 x 2\n    which is 227 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 228. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This is the first round, so no discount applies yet.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer to accept, I will create a counteroffer maximizing my value, ensuring it's above 598.\n\nConsider a few potential divisions:\n\n1. **Offer**: Give 2 units of Item 1, all 4 units of Item 2 & Item 5, 4 units of Item 3 and 3 units of Item 4 to Player 2, keeping [3, 0, 3, 4, 0] for myself.\n   - Calculating my value:\n     - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n     - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 12 = 0\n     - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n     - 4 units of Item 4 = 4 \u00d7 82 = 328\n     - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n   - Total value = 129 + 0 + 21 + 328 + 0 = 478\n\nI will try a slightly different approach to create a new counteroffer that yields a value above 598 for me.\n\n2. **Offer**: Give 2 units of Item 1, all 4 units of Item 2, 6 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, and all 4 units of Item 5 to Player 2, keeping [3, 0, 1, 5, 0] for myself.\n   - Calculating my value:\n     - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n     - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 12 = 0\n     - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n     - 5 units of Item 4 = 5 \u00d7 82 = 410\n     - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n   - Total value = 129 + 0 + 7 + 410 + 0 = 546\n\nEven with this adjustment, my value is still below 598, my outside offer. So I will not propose this split.\n\nLet's attempt another combination:\n\n3. **Offer**: Give 0 units of Item 1, all 4 units of Item 2 & Item 5, 6 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4 to Player 2, keeping [5, 0, 1, 7, 0] for myself.\n   - Calculating my value:\n     - 5 units of Item 1 = 5 \u00d7 43 = 215\n     - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 12 = 0\n     - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n     - 7 units of Item 4 = 7 \u00d7 82 = 574\n     - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n   - Total value = 215 + 0 + 7 + 574 + 0 = 796\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of 796, which is greater than my outside offer of 598.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, offering [0, 4, 6, 0, 4] units to Player 2, keeping [5, 0, 1, 7, 0] for myself gets my value above the outside offer, ensuring I am in a beneficial position.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 6, 0, 4]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 114. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 0 + 57 x 1 + 51 x 0 + 17 x 1 + 13 x 3\n    which is 113 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 114. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 6, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 6, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 114\n   - Item values: item 1 = 75, item 2 = 57, item 3 = 51, item 4 = 17, item 5 = 13\n   - Total pool of items: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. The current round is round 1, so the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. This means there is no discount for accepting the offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 4, 6, 0, 4]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n   - Value of current offer: (0 * 75) + (4 * 57) + (6 * 51) + (0 * 17) + (4 * 13) = 0 + 228 + 306 + 0 + 52 = 586.\n   - Since 586 is greater than my outside offer of 114, accepting the offer is better than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - The current offer is quite generous. Let's consider making a counteroffer that might give me even more value, but we must make sure we don't fall for the mistakes described. Player 1 offered me a high value already, so it's risky to try to get more.\n\nGiven that the current offer's value (586) is significantly higher than my outside offer (114), I should accept the offer. Making a counteroffer at this stage seems risky since it opens the possibility of receiving a worse offer in future rounds.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 2 + 21 x 0 + 19 x 3 + 97 x 1 + 77 x 3\n    which is 477 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 479. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 479.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 46, item 2 = 21, item 3 = 19, item 4 = 97, item 5 = 77.\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is:\n     (0 * 46) + (0 * 21) + (0 * 19) + (0 * 97) + (1 * 77) = 77.  This is far less than my outside offer of 479.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get from different divisions of the items. I want to aim for a total value greater than 479.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is a bad idea (77 < 479).\n   - Walking away now guarantees me 479.\n   - I need to construct a counteroffer that is better than walking away.\n   Let's consider an offer where I give Player 1 only 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 3.\n   My total value is then:\n   (1 * 46) + (0 * 21) + (3 * 19) + (1 * 97) + (4 * 77) = 46 + 0 + 57 + 97 + 308 = 508.\n   This is better than my outside offer value. Therefore, I want to make the offer where I have 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5. This would be achieved by offering player 1 the rest. This is 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5.\n   - I'm in round 1, so I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Let's explore some counteroffers.\n* I have item quantities [2, 0, 4, 1, 4] in total.\n* If I keep items [2, 0, 4, 1, 4], my value is (2*46 + 0*21 + 4*19 + 1*97 + 4*77) = 92 + 0 + 76 + 97 + 308 = 573.\n\nNow let's try to find a good counteroffer. I want to keep high value items like 4 and 5.\nCounteroffer 1: Player 1 gets [1,0,2,0,0] and I keep [1,0,2,1,4] = (1*46+0*21+2*19+1*97+4*77) = 46+0+38+97+308 = 489, my value would be above my outside offer.\nCounteroffer 2: Player 1 gets [0,0,0,0,1] and I keep [2,0,4,1,3] = (2*46+0*21+4*19+1*97+3*77) = 92+0+76+97+231 = 496, my value would be above my outside offer.\nCounteroffer 3: Player 1 gets [0,0,1,0,1] and I keep [2,0,3,1,3] = (2*46+0*21+3*19+1*97+3*77) = 92+0+57+97+231 = 477, not as good as my outside offer.\nCounteroffer 4: Player 1 gets [0,0,2,0,2] and I keep [2,0,2,1,2] = (2*46+0*21+2*19+1*97+2*77) = 92+0+38+97+154 = 381. Way below the outside offer.\n\nLet's try to make an offer a bit more aggressive.\nCounteroffer 5: Player 1 gets [1, 0, 3, 0, 3] and I keep [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] = (1\\*46 + 0\\*21 + 1\\*19 + 1\\*97 + 1\\*77) = 46+0+19+97+77 = 239. It is far lower than my outside offer, so mistake 2.\n\nI'll go with Counteroffer 1\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI should make a counteroffer that benefits me and is higher than the outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 507. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 858 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 0 + 95 x 0 + 89 x 4 + 14 x 1 + 45 x 3\n    which is 505 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 507. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I need to propose a counteroffer that provides at least as much value as my outside offer of 507, otherwise, the best action is to walk away.\n\n   - **Calculate potential counteroffer:** \n\n     I should propose keeping a combination that provides a value of at least 507.\n     \n     For example, if I keep:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 43\n     - 0 unit of item 2: 0\n     - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 14\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n\n     Total value = 43 + 0 + 356 + 14 + 90 = 503, which is still less than 507.\n\n     If I keep:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n     - 0 unit of item 2: 0\n     - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 14\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0\n\n     Total value = 86 + 0 + 356 + 14 = 456, still not adequate.\n\n     A possible division that exceeds my outside offer would be to keep:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n     - 0 unit of item 2: 0\n     - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 14\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n\n     Total value = 86 + 0 + 356 + 14 + 45 = 501, so increase the units of item 5 to 2\n\n     Therefore my counteroffer (to give to Player 2) would be: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]. This keeps:\n\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 86 \n     - 4 units of item 3 = 356 \n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 14 \n     - 2 units of item 5 = 90 \n\n     Total of 546, which is above my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 661. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 762 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 4, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 1 + 66 x 2 + 64 x 4 + 5 x 3 + 46 x 4\n    which is 660 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 661. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide my action, I need to evaluate the current situation and determine what type of offer to propose to Player 2 that maximizes my value while ensuring it's more valuable than my outside offer. Here's my step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My fallback option is worth 661.\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 73 per unit\n  - Item 2: 66 per unit\n  - Item 3: 64 per unit\n  - Item 4: 5 per unit\n  - Item 5: 46 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 9 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 5 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 5 units\n- **Discount Factor**: The value of waiting increases slightly due to the discount factor, but since this is the first round, it doesn't drastically impact my decision.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **No Current Offer**: Since there is no offer, I can only propose a counteroffer.\n- **Evaluate a Potential Offer**: \n  - Aim to keep a combination of items whose total value exceeds 661.\n\nLet's calculate a counteroffer where I keep the most valuable items based on my valuations:\n- Keep maximum Item 1: 9 units (9 * 73 = 657)\n- Give away all the remaining items: Item 2 (4 units), Item 3 (5 units), Item 4 (3 units), and Item 5 (5 units).\n\nCalculate my total value:\n- Total = 657 (Item 1) + 0 (Item 2) + 0 (Item 3) + 0 (Item 4) + 0 (Item 5) = 657\n- Since 657 is less than my outside offer of 661, I should adjust to achieve a higher total.\n\nTry adjusting while focusing on high-value items:\n- Keep Item 1: 8 units (8 * 73 = 584)\n- Keep Item 2: 1 unit (1 * 66 = 66)\n- Keep Item 3: 1 unit (1 * 64 = 64)\n- Total = 584 + 66 + 64 = 714\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- My adjusted offer means giving Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 5 units\n\nThis division provides me with a value of 714, which is greater than my outside offer of 661.

We must consider this factor in our calculations for future rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - For the current offer: [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n     - I would get 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n     - Calculating the total value:\n       - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 73 = 73\n       - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n       - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n       - Total value = 73 + 132 + 64 + 5 + 46 = 320\n\n   - This offer is worth 320, which is significantly less than my outside offer value of 661. Therefore, accepting this offer is not an advantageous option.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\n   - Since the current offer is less valuable than my outside offer, accepting is not a viable choice.\n   - Walking away would secure my outside offer value of 661.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me at least 662 in value after applying the discount factor for round 2.\n\nI will calculate a potential counteroffer that would maximize my value:\n\n   Let's consider an example counteroffer where I keep:\n   - Item 1: 7 (give 2 to Player 2)\n   - Item 2: 0 (give 4 to Player 2)\n   - Item 3: 4 (give 1 to Player 2)\n   - Item 4: 0 (give 3 to Player 2)\n   - Item 5: 4 (give 1 to Player 2)\n   \n   My value calculation:\n   - Item 1: 7 x 73 = 511\n   - Item 2: 0 x 66 = 0\n   - Item 3: 4 x 64 = 256\n   - Item 4: 0 x 5 = 0\n   - Item 5: 4 x 46 = 184\n   - Total value = 951\n\nThis would give me a value of 951, which is more than my outside offer even after discounting in round 2.\n   \nTherefore, a counteroffer that I can propose could be [2, 4, 1, 3, 1].\n   \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 1, 3, 1]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 524. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 524. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 408 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 1, 5, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 6 + 10 x 1 + 15 x 5 + 30 x 3 + 46 x 3\n    which is 523 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 524. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 4, 3, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 524.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 35, item 2 = 10, item 3 = 15, item 4 = 30, item 5 = 46.\n*   Total pool of items: 9 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of an offer accepted in round 2, and an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of an offer accepted in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 4, 1, 3, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 35 = 70\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 10 = 40\n    *   1 units of item 3: 1 * 15 = 15\n    *   3 units of item 4: 3 * 30 = 90\n    *   1 units of item 5: 1 * 46 = 46\n    *   Total value of current offer: 70 + 40 + 15 + 90 + 46 = 261\n\n    Since it's round 2, if I accept now, the value is 261 * 0.9 = 234.9.\n    This is much less than my outside offer of 524.\n\n*   **If I walk away:** I get my outside offer of 524.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value.\n    I currently have 9 item 1, 4 item 2, 5 item 3, 3 item 4, 5 item 5 available.\n    If the other player offers me [2, 4, 1, 3, 1], they are keeping:\n    Item 1: 9 - 2 = 7\n    Item 2: 4 - 4 = 0\n    Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4\n    Item 4: 3 - 3 = 0\n    Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4\n\n    I want to create a counteroffer that gives them enough value that they'll accept but still leaves me with more than 524.\n    Let's try to give the opponent 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. This means I will keep:\n\n    Item 1: 9 - 3 = 6 units -> 6 * 35 = 210\n    Item 2: 4 - 3 = 1 unit -> 1 * 10 = 10\n    Item 3: 5 - 4 = 1 unit -> 1 * 15 = 15\n    Item 4: 3 - 3 = 0 units -> 0 * 30 = 0\n    Item 5: 5 - 4 = 1 unit -> 1 * 46 = 46\n\n    Total value for me = 210 + 10 + 15 + 0 + 46 = 281. Discounted, the value would be 281*0.9 = 252.9, still worse than my outside option. This also doesn't leave much value for Player 1, so they would probably reject.\n\n    Let me try giving a very small offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I keep all the items:\n    Item 1: 9 * 35 = 315\n    Item 2: 4 * 10 = 40\n    Item 3: 5 * 15 = 75\n    Item 4: 3 * 30 = 90\n    Item 5: 5 * 46 = 230\n    Total value = 315 + 40 + 75 + 90 + 230 = 750. Discounted, the value would be 750*0.9 = 675. I'm just testing if this gives value. I know it's not a good offer.\n\n    Given it is Round 2, I think making a very low-ball offer in round two is also not going to lead to anything but a Walk in round 3. If there was only one round left I'd play the outside value.\n\n    To give the opponent, say: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5:\n        I'm keeping:\n            8 unit of item 1: 8 * 35 = 280\n            3 unit of item 2: 3 * 10 = 30\n            4 unit of item 3: 4 * 15 = 60\n            2 unit of item 4: 2 * 30 = 60\n            4 unit of item 5: 4 * 46 = 184\n    total: 280+30+60+60+184 = 614.\n    So if I offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], I get 614 * 0.9 = 552.6 which is higher than my outside offer of 524.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [2, 4, 1, 3, 1] is not good. I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 423. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 618 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 14 x 4 + 23 x 3 + 99 x 3\n    which is 422 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 423. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 59. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 858 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 24 x 1 + 31 x 1 + 75 x 0\n    which is 55 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 59. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I will try offering [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n- If I offer [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], I keep: item 1: 6, item 2: 3, item 3: 2, item 4: 1, item 5: 4\n- Value of keeping these items: (6 * 64) + (3 * 92) + (2 * 24) + (1 * 31) + (4 * 75) = 384 + 276 + 48 + 31 + 300 = 1039\n- Offering [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] will be good for me.\n\nLet's also try offering them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n- If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I keep: item 1: 8, item 2: 3, item 3: 2, item 4: 1, item 5: 4\n- Value of keeping these items: (8 * 64) + (3 * 92) + (2 * 24) + (1 * 31) + (4 * 75) = 512 + 276 + 48 + 31 + 300 = 1167\n- Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is also good.\n\nSince it's the first round, I will make a counteroffer, trying to get more value. I want to offer something that gives me more than my outside option.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer of [2, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n4. **Make a decision:**\nSince the current offer of [3, 0, 0, 0, 1] has value 267 > 59, it's better than walking away with my outside option of 59.

This means that accepting an offer later is worth less.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 3 * 64 = 192\n    *   Item 2: 0 * 92 = 0\n    *   Item 3: 0 * 24 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 31 = 31\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 75 = 75\n    *   Total value: 192 + 0 + 0 + 31 + 75 = 298\n\nSince this is round 2, the value is discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the discounted value is 298 * 0.9 = 268.2.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 268.2 is much greater than my outside offer of 59.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I ask for almost everything: offer [5, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n    * I get [3, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n    * Value = (3 * 64) + (1 * 92) + (0 * 24) + (0 * 31) + (1 * 75) = 192 + 92 + 0 + 0 + 75 = 359\n    * Discounted value = 359 * 0.9 = 323.1\n\n    Let's consider a counteroffer where I offer them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n    * I get [8, 3, 2, 1, 4].\n    * Value = (8 * 64) + (3 * 92) + (2 * 24) + (1 * 31) + (4 * 75) = 512 + 276 + 48 + 31 + 300 = 1167\n    * Discounted value = 1167 * 0.9 = 1050.3\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 268.2, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 59.\n*   Counteroffering could potentially get me a better deal.\n\nSince I'm in round 2, and the current offer is quite good, accepting is likely the best strategy. Making a counteroffer in round 2 risks getting a worse offer (or the negotiation ending with my outside offer in round 3 if Player 1 rejects my counteroffer).\n\n**Final Answer:** The best action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 3 + 90 x 0 + 69 x 0 + 99 x 0 + 36 x 1\n    which is 51 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 56. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 2 + 6 x 1 + 72 x 0 + 18 x 0 + 91 x 1\n    which is 213 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 214. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 153\n*   **My item values:** item 1 = 100, item 2 = 68, item 3 = 35, item 4 = 21, item 5 = 28\n*   **Total items:** 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 3, 0, 3, 0]. This means they are offering me 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n    *   **Value of current offer:** (0 * 100) + (3 * 68) + (0 * 35) + (3 * 21) + (0 * 28) = 0 + 204 + 0 + 63 + 0 = 267\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 267 > 153. Accepting the current offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would keep and what I would offer. I must keep at least 327/0.9=363 of offer.\n\n    *   **Possible Strategy:** Aim for a fairer split that still exceeds my outside offer, leaving room for negotiation in later rounds if needed.\n      Let's consider a split close to equal value. The total value in the game if I get it all is :\n      (3 * 100) + (6 * 68) + (4 * 35) + (5 * 21) + (4 * 28) = 300 + 408 + 140 + 105 + 112 = 1065\n      The average value is 1065/2=532.5\n      Let's try to construct an offer that gives player 1 a value of roughly 532. I keep items with high value and sacrifice less valued items.\n      Let's try an offer where I offer player 1 all of item 4 and 5, and half of item 2. So my offer to them is [0, 3, 0, 5, 4]. Then my value is:\n      3*100 + 3*68 + 4*35 + 0*21 + 0*28 = 300+204+140=644\n      The other players value is\n      0*val1 + 3*val2 + 0*val3 + 5*val4 + 4*val5\n      This is not good to me. I will make another offer.\n     I offer 2 units of item 1, all of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5. Then, my value is\n     1*100 + 0*68 + 2*35 + 3*21 + 2*28 = 100 + 0 + 70 + 63 + 56 = 289.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer yields 267 > 153.\n*   However, I can potentially get a better deal.\n*   I will make a counteroffer that is closer to a fair split, but still advantageous to me.\n    Since the current offer is a bit low, I will give player 1 more units of item 1. I offer Player 1 [1, 3, 2, 3, 2].\n\n    My value with this counteroffer:\n    (2 * 100) + (3 * 68) + (2 * 35) + (2 * 21) + (2 * 28) = 200 + 204 + 70 + 42 + 56 = 572 > 153\n\n    Player 1's value will then be 1*val1 + 3*val2 + 2*val3 + 3*val4 + 2*val5\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 3, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1322. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1020 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 7, 3, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 4 + 45 x 7 + 78 x 3 + 65 x 4 + 96 x 3\n    which is 1321 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1322. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 6) + (1 * 41) + (2 * 96) + (1 * 59) + (0 * 30) = 0 + 41 + 192 + 59 + 0 = 292.\n    Since 292 is less than my outside offer of 405, accepting this offer is a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 405. I have to consider what I keep, not what I offer to the other player.\n    I have a total value of 1033 if I keep all the items.\n\n    Let's explore a few potential counteroffers and their values to me:\n\n    *   **Offer Player 1 everything except the item I value most (item 3):** I keep all 4 units of item 3. This gives me 4 * 96 = 384. This isn't enough to beat my outside offer.\n    *   **Offer Player 1 everything except items 3 and 4:** I keep all 4 units of item 3 and all 4 units of item 4. This gives me (4 * 96) + (4 * 59) = 384 + 236 = 620. This is more than my outside offer.\n    *   **Offer Player 1 everything except items 2, 3 and 4:** I keep all 7 units of item 2, all 4 units of item 3 and all 4 units of item 4. This gives me (7 * 41) + (4 * 96) + (4 * 59) = 287 + 384 + 236 = 907. This is a very high value for me, potentially leaving value on the table for the other player.\n\n    Let's try to create a better counteroffer that balances my value with leaving some for Player 1:\n     - Try to keep 2 item 1, 3 item 2, 3 item 3, 2 item 4 and 2 item 5.\n        Value calculation: (2 * 6) + (3 * 41) + (3 * 96) + (2 * 59) + (2 * 30) = 12 + 123 + 288 + 118 + 60 = 601.\n        This requires offering Player 1: 4 item 1, 4 item 2, 1 item 3, 2 item 4 and 1 item 5.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away is a valid option.\n*   Proposing a counteroffer is a good strategy to try to reach a better outcome.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I will make a counteroffer. I want to propose a division that gives me a value greater than 405 while still leaving something for Player 1. I will go with the offer: keep 2 item 1, 3 item 2, 3 item 3, 2 item 4 and 2 item 5.

Since we are in round 2, the discount applied to the resulting value would be gamma to the power of 1 (0.9^1 = 0.9).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - *Current offer* (What I would receive): [4, 4, 1, 2, 1]\n     - Value if I accept this offer:\n       - 4 units of item 1 = 4 x 56 = 224\n       - 4 units of item 2 = 4 x 45 = 180\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 x 78 = 78\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 65 = 130\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 x 96 = 96\n     - Total value without discount = 224 + 180 + 78 + 130 + 96 = 708\n     - Total value after discount (round 2) = 708 * 0.9 = 637.2\n\n   - *Comparison with my outside offer value*:\n     - My outside offer value is 1322, which is significantly higher than the discounted value of accepting the current offer (637.2).\n\n   - *Proposal for a better counteroffer*:\n     I should aim for a division where my total value exceeds 1322 to justify not taking the outside offer.\n\n     Let's calculate an offer scenario where I maximize my value:\n     - Assume I propose [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], keeping [5, 7, 4, 4, 3] for myself.\n     - Value of what I keep:\n       - 5 units of item 1 = 5 x 56 = 280\n       - 7 units of item 2 = 7 x 45 = 315\n       - 4 units of item 3 = 4 x 78 = 312\n       - 4 units of item 4 = 4 x 65 = 260\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 x 96 = 288\n     - Total value = 280 + 315 + 312 + 260 + 288 = 1455\n\n     Since 1455 > 1322, this is a better outcome compared to my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nGiven that accepting the current offer would result in a value of 637.2, which is much less than my outside offer value of 1322, I should not accept the current offer. Walking away nets 1322, which is higher than the current discounted value on offer.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 405. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 41 x 1 + 96 x 1 + 59 x 3 + 30 x 3\n    which is 404 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 405. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 4, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 405.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 6, 41, 96, 59, 30 respectively.\n   - Total items are 6, 7, 4, 4, 3 respectively.\n   - Discount factor is 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I receive [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 gets 1 unit of item 1.\n     - My items would be [6-1, 7-0, 4-0, 4-0, 3-0] = [5, 7, 4, 4, 3].\n     - My value = (5 * 6) + (7 * 41) + (4 * 96) + (4 * 59) + (3 * 30) = 30 + 287 + 384 + 236 + 90 = 1027.\n     - Since 1027 > 405, accepting is better than walking away *at this round*, since this is round 2 the discount factor is important.\n     - Discount factor = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So 1027 * 0.9 = 924.3\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - I need to find an offer that's better for me than my outside offer value.\n\n**Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep almost everything.**\nI offer Player 1 [2, 3, 2, 2, 2].\n\nMy items would be [6-2, 7-3, 4-2, 4-2, 3-2] = [4, 4, 2, 2, 1].\nMy value = (4 * 6) + (4 * 41) + (2 * 96) + (2 * 59) + (1 * 30) = 24 + 164 + 192 + 118 + 30 = 528.\nSince 528 > 405, this is better than walking away at this round.\nDiscount factor = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.

So 760 * 0.9 = 684\n\nIt is better to accept than to walk away, but I can try to get more.\n\nOkay, let's finalize my decision. Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 924.3.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 1 + 78 x 1 + 17 x 0 + 78 x 6 + 6 x 1\n    which is 632 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 635. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 6, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 6, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's try to construct an offer where I keep more of the items I value highly.\n    *   Let's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 3, 6, 0]. This means I keep:\n        *   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n        *   Item 2: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n        *   Item 3: 3 - 3 = 0 units\n        *   Item 4: 6 - 6 = 0 units\n        *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n        My value for this offer is: (1 * 80) + (5 * 78) + (0 * 17) + (0 * 78) + (1 * 6) = 80 + 390 + 0 + 0 + 6 = 476.\n        Since this is round 2, the discounted value of accepting this offer is 476 * 0.9 = 428.4\n    *   This is less than my outside offer of 635.\n\n    *   Let's try offering Player 1 [0, 4, 2, 5, 0]. This means I keep:\n        *   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n        *   Item 2: 5 - 4 = 1 unit\n        *   Item 3: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n        *   Item 4: 6 - 5 = 1 unit\n        *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n        My value for this offer is: (1 * 80) + (1 * 78) + (1 * 17) + (1 * 78) + (1 * 6) = 80 + 78 + 17 + 78 + 6 = 259.\n        Since this is round 2, the discounted value of accepting this offer is 259 * 0.9 = 233.1\n\n    *   This is less than my outside offer of 635. I will WALK\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 523.8 after discounting, which is less than my outside offer of 635.\n\nI tried to make some offers. It is clear I will not make an offer greater than the outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 98 x 0 + 26 x 1\n    which is 26 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 38. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 340\n   - My item values: item 1 = 76, item 2 = 40, item 3 = 82, item 4 = 61, item 5 = 7\n   - Total item pool: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 2, 3, 3, 3].  This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n      - Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n      - Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n      - Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n      - Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n\n      My value for accepting this offer:\n      (3 * 76) + (2 * 40) + (3 * 82) + (3 * 61) + (3 * 7) = 228 + 80 + 246 + 183 + 21 = 758\n\n      Since 758 > 340, accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine if a better counteroffer exists. Consider an extreme case where I offer Player 1 nothing, which is equivalent to asking for everything. I keep [5, 4, 6, 6, 6], which is a value to me of:\n      (5 * 76) + (4 * 40) + (6 * 82) + (6 * 61) + (6 * 7) = 380 + 160 + 492 + 366 + 42 = 1440\n      Offering Player 1 nothing seems unrealistic, however it gives me an upper bound of the most value I can receive. Now I need to compare this value to discounted values.\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 758, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 340. However, I should take into account the discount factor. In round 2, I need to have 340/0.9=377.78 value. In round 3, I need to have 340/0.81=419.75 value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    Since the current offer is substantially better than my outside offer, there is no need to make an extreme counteroffer at the beginning. Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 758. This is significantly higher than the outside offer. However, I'm at the start of the negotiation. I should propose a counteroffer. The current offer I am receiving is [2, 2, 3, 3, 3]. I'll request a slightly more aggressive split and offer them the following: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]. This leads to me keeping [4, 3, 4, 4, 4].\n\n   My value for accepting this offer:\n    (4 * 76) + (3 * 40) + (4 * 82) + (4 * 61) + (4 * 7) = 304 + 120 + 328 + 244 + 28 = 1024\n\n    This new offer is better than the old one.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 98 x 0 + 26 x 1\n    which is 26 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 38. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 543. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 543. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 5 + 39 x 4 + 69 x 2 + 15 x 2 + 74 x 2\n    which is 542 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 543. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

I will start by considering an offer that maximizes my value while being reasonable to Player 2.\n   - I need a total value exceeding my outside offer of 543.\n\nLet's consider how I might split the items:\n\nPropose I take [3, 2, 1, 3, 1] and offer Player 2 [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]:\n- My computations:\n  - Item 1: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n  - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n  - Item 3: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n  - Item 4: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n  - Item 5: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 74 = 74\n  - Total value = 42 + 78 + 69 + 45 + 74 = 308, which is less than 543.\n\nClearly, this proposed distribution does not exceed the value of my outside offer. \n\nLet's try another proposal:\n\nI take [4, 2, 1, 3, 1] and offer Player 2 [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]:\n- My computations:\n  - Item 1: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n  - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n  - Item 3: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n  - Item 4: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n  - Item 5: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 74 = 74\n  - Total value = 56 + 78 + 69 + 45 + 74 = 322, which is still less than 543.\n\nTrying a maximum strategy:\n\nI take [5, 4, 1, 3, 1] and offer Player 2 [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]:\n- My computations:\n  - Item 1: 5 units = 5 \u00d7 14 = 70\n  - Item 2: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n  - Item 3: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n  - Item 4: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n  - Item 5: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 74 = 74\n  - Total value = 70 + 156 + 69 + 45 + 74 = 414, which is still less than 543.\n\nIt seems I must retain close to everything, to compare values let's try:\n\nI take [5, 4, 2, 2, 2] and offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]:\n- My computations:\n  - Item 1: 5 units = 5 \u00d7 14 = 70\n  - Item 2: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n  - Item 3: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n  - Item 4: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n  - Item 5: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n  - Total value = 70 + 156 + 138 + 30 + 148 = 542, which is still less than 543.\n\nI will now take everything, [5, 4, 2, 4, 2] and offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n- My computations:\n  - Item 1: 5 units = 5 \u00d7 14 = 70\n  - Item 2: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n  - Item 3: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n  - Item 4: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 15 = 60\n  - Item 5: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n  - Total value = 572.\n\nThis gives me a value higher than my outside offer (since this is less prone to acceptance due to being maximum, let me reevaluate):\n\nLet's finalize with: I take [5, 3, 2, 4, 1] and offer Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]:\n- My computations:\n  - Item 1: 5 units = 5 \u00d7 14 = 70\n  - Item 2: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n  - Item 3: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n  - Item 4: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 15 = 60\n  - Item 5: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 74 = 74\n  - Total value = 59 + 156 + 138 + 60 + 74 = 517, which is lower but feasible for negotiation.\n\nFinally, suggesting a balanced offer:\n\nI'd consider taking nearly every unit because other distributions are low or way above optimal responses.\n\nThus a tactical counterproposal: [5, 4, 2, 3, 2], offer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now. Specifically, it will be worth 90% as much each round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My value for this offer is (0 * 48) + (0 * 28) + (0 * 100) + (1 * 44) + (0 * 63) = 44. This is much lower than my outside offer of 354.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer to Player 1 that leaves me with a value greater than 354.\n\n   Let's consider keeping all of item 3 and item 5. That's 2 * 100 + 2 * 63 = 200 + 126 = 326. I'm still under my outside offer.\n\n   Let's consider keeping all of item 3 and item 5 and 1 item 1. That's 2 * 100 + 2 * 63 + 1*48 = 200 + 126 + 48 = 374. This is greater than my outside offer.\n   So I would offer Player 1, [4, 4, 0, 4, 0]. That would leave me with [1, 0, 2, 0, 2].\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is terrible. I would get a value of 44, while my outside offer is 354.\n   - Walking away means I get 354.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer seems like the best option to maximize my outcome. I can suggest a division of items that yields a value greater than my outside offer, while still giving Player 1 a good deal.\n\nBased on the above analysis, my optimal action is to make a counteroffer. I'll offer Player 1 [4, 4, 0, 4, 0]. This leaves me with [1, 0, 2, 0, 2] which is a value of 374.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 0, 4, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 5 + 39 x 4 + 69 x 2 + 15 x 2 + 74 x 2\n    which is 542 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 543. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 4, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 4, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "1) First, analyze the current situation:\n\n- My outside offer value is 543.\n- My private values per item type are: \n  - Item 1: 14\n  - Item 2: 39\n  - Item 3: 69\n  - Item 4: 15\n  - Item 5: 74\n- The total pool of items is: \n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n- The discount factor (gamma) influences the value of the outcome by reducing it if acceptance occurs in later rounds. However, with a high outside offer, my decision should primarily ensure any deal is better than this fallback, especially considering negotiation value diminishes with each round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- Current offer ([4, 4, 0, 4, 0]): \n  - Item 1: 14 x 1 = 14 (as I'm keeping 1 unit)\n  - Item 2: 39 x 0 = 0 (as I'm getting 0 units)\n  - Item 3: 69 x 2 = 138 (as I'm keeping all)\n  - Item 4: 15 x 0 = 0 (I'm getting 0 units)\n  - Item 5: 74 x 2 = 148 (as I'm keeping both)\n  - Total value = 14 + 0 + 138 + 0 + 148 = 300\n\nThe current offer is worth 300 to me, which is significantly less than my outside offer value of 543.\n\nPossible counteroffers need to be calculated to ensure a value exceeding 543. For a quick example:\n- Keep [5, 0, 2, 0, 2]:\n  - Item 1: 14 x 5 = 70\n  - Item 2: 39 x 0 = 0\n  - Item 3: 69 x 2 = 138\n  - Item 4: 15 x 0 = 0\n  - Item 5: 74 x 2 = 148\n  - Total value = 70 + 0 + 138 + 0 + 148 = 356 (not viable)\n\n- Keep [5, 0, 2, 2, 2]:\n  - Item 1: 14 x 5 = 70\n  - Item 2: 39 x 0 = 0\n  - Item 3: 69 x 2 = 138\n  - Item 4: 15 x 2 = 30\n  - Item 5: 74 x 2 = 148\n  - Total value = 70 + 0 + 138 + 30 + 148 = 386 (insufficient)\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nGiven the calculated offer values are below my outside offer, in order to align with my objectives and ensure I don\u2019t fall into any of the negotiation mistakes, I must propose a new counteroffer. \n\nPossible counteroffer to exceed my outside offer:\n\n- Keep [5, 2, 2, 0, 2]:\n  - Item 1: 14 x 5 = 70\n  - Item 2: 39 x 2 = 78\n  - Item 3: 69 x 2 = 138\n  - Item 4: 15 x 0 = 0\n  - Item 5: 74 x 2 = 148\n  - Total value = 70 + 78 + 138 + 0 + 148 = 434 (also not enough)\n\nBased on this, more items have to shift in my favor or a different approach is needed.\n\nLet's attempt a highly favorable split:\n- Keep [5, 4, 2, 2, 2] and give nothing:\n  - Item 1: 14 x 5 = 70\n  - Item 2: 39 x 4 = 156\n  - Item 3: 69 x 2 = 138\n  - Item 4: 15 x 2 = 30\n  - Item 5: 74 x 2 = 148\n  - Total value = 70 + 156 + 138 + 30 + 148 = 542 (just under outside offer)\n\nAdjust once more:\n\n- [5, 3, 2, 4, 0]\n  - Item 1: 14 x 5 = 70\n  - Item 2: 39 x 3 = 117\n  - Item 3: 69 x 2 = 138\n  - Item 4: 15 x 0 = 0\n  - Item 5: 74 x 2 = 148\n  - Total value = 70 + 117 + 138 + 0 + 148 = 473 (still below)\n\nReflecting this computation quickly illustrates my original template counter fell short or equally weighted provisions miscalculated before I had realized.\n\nGiven my evaluation tightens closer to this variance, I'll take action as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"} \n```",

Accepting the current offer is better than walking away with my outside offer.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's explore a potential counteroffer.\n   I'm getting quite a good deal with the current offer. Let's try for an offer with a similar value but slightly more favorable for myself, just to see if Player 1 will accept. \n   I'll start by reducing item 5.\n\n    What if I offered [0, 2, 3, 2, 3]? This means I would keep [0, 2, 2, 3, 4]:\n    0 * 52 + 2 * 69 + 2 * 72 + 3 * 9 + 4 * 56 = 0 + 138 + 144 + 27 + 224 = 533\n    What if I offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 3]? This means I would keep [0, 3, 3, 4, 4]:\n    0 * 52 + 3 * 69 + 3 * 72 + 4 * 9 + 4 * 56 = 0 + 207 + 216 + 36 + 224 = 683\n\n    What if I offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]? This means I would keep [0, 3, 3, 3, 4]:\n    0 * 52 + 3 * 69 + 3 * 72 + 3 * 9 + 4 * 56 = 0 + 207 + 216 + 27 + 224 = 674\n    \n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   - The current offer is already better than my outside offer.\n   - I could propose a counteroffer. However, given that the current offer is quite good, there is a risk of losing it. Let's try to get a tiny bit more.\n\n   I will try to get slightly more item 4 since it is low value.\n   Counteroffer: [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]\n   My value: 0*52 + 2*69 + 2*72 + 4*9 + 3*56 = 0 + 138 + 144 + 36 + 168 = 486\n\n   I will try to get slightly more item 2 and 4.\n   Counteroffer: [0, 1, 3, 1, 4]\n   My value: 0*52 + 3*69 + 2*72 + 4*9 + 3*56 = 0 + 207 + 144 + 36 + 168 = 555\n\n   Since the current offer of 596 is good I will accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 897\n   - Item values: item 1 = 97, item 2 = 98, item 3 = 92, item 4 = 39, item 5 = 22\n   - Total pool of items: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I receive [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]. This means Player 1 gets:\n     - Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n     - Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n     - Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n     - Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3\n     - Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n   - Value of current offer to me: (1 * 97) + (1 * 98) + (2 * 92) + (0 * 39) + (1 * 22) = 97 + 98 + 184 + 0 + 22 = 401.\n   - Since 401 is less than my outside offer of 897, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n   - Now consider a counteroffer. I want to keep as much of the high-value items (1, 2, and 3) as possible. Let's try offering the other player only the minimum amount of items 4 and 5, since they are relatively low value to me. I need to get at least 897 of value. Let's see what happens if I offer everything for items 4 and 5 and nothing for items 1, 2, and 3.\n   - Keep 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n     Value = (4 * 97) + (4 * 98) + (4 * 92) + (0 * 39) + (0 * 22) = 388 + 392 + 368 + 0 + 0 = 1148.\n     This is way above my outside offer. Let's explore a little further:\n   - Keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n     Value = (3 * 97) + (3 * 98) + (3 * 92) + (0 * 39) + (0 * 22) = 291 + 294 + 276 + 0 + 0 = 861.\n     This is still below my outside option.\n   - So let's try keeping all of items 1 and 2, and as much as possible of item 3:\n     Value = (4 * 97) + (4 * 98) = 388 + 392 = 780.\n     I need at least 897. 897 - 780 = 117. 117 / 92 = 1.27. So I can't give away 3 of item 3 - need to give away 2 and keep 2:\n     Value = (4 * 97) + (4 * 98) + (2 * 92) = 388 + 392 + 184 = 964. This works.\n     So I keep [4, 4, 2, 0, 0] and offer the rest.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is terrible.\n   - I can make a counteroffer where I keep [4, 4, 2, 0, 0] and offer the other player [0, 0, 2, 3, 4].\n   - This gives me a value of 964, which is greater than my outside offer of 897.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 3, 4]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 596. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 1 + 71 x 1 + 42 x 3 + 88 x 3 + 30 x 4\n    which is 594 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 596. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 3, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's step through the analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 596.\n   - The values of the items involved are:\n     - Item 1: 13\n     - Item 2: 71\n     - Item 3: 42\n     - Item 4: 88\n     - Item 5: 30\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - Item 1: 4\n     - Item 2: 4\n     - Item 3: 4\n     - Item 4: 3\n     - Item 5: 4\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, influencing the value based on negotiation rounds. Since this is round 2, any outcome's value is multiplied by gamma to the power of (r-1), which is 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - For the current offer [0, 0, 2, 3, 4], my value calculation is:\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n     - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n     - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 30 = 120\n     - Total value = 468\n     - Adjusted value with discount factor = 468 * 0.9 = 421.2\n   - My outside offer value is 596, which is higher than 421.2, so I should not accept the current offer.\n   - I need a counteroffer where my value exceeds my outside offer of 596.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Given the calculation mistakes should be avoided:\n     - My previous offers need to be higher in value than the current offer to avoid Mistake 1.\n     - I should not propose an offer resulting in less than 596 in value (Mistake 2).\n     - I will avoid offering no items or all items to Player 2 (Mistake 3).\n\nTo create a beneficial counteroffer, I need to evaluate potential splits and ensure I obtain a higher value than my outside offer. Here\u2019s a possible proposal:\n\n- If I keep 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 2, and 1 unit of item 5 for myself, and offer Player 2 the rest ([4, 0, 2, 0, 3]), my value would calculate as:\n\n  - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n  - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 71 = 284\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 42 = 0\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n  - Total value = 578 which is less than 596\n\nAs the value is less than my outside offer, this is not better for me. I will choose to walk away to guarantee the higher outside offer value:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 2 + 66 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 42 x 1 + 87 x 0\n    which is 148 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 150. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 644\n*   My values for the items: Item 1: 15, Item 2: 60, Item 3: 96, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 68\n*   Total pool of items: Item 1: 4, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer: (0 * 15) + (1 * 60) + (0 * 96) + (2 * 2) + (0 * 68) = 0 + 60 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 64\n    *   Since 64 < 644, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer (what I give to Player 1) that results in me keeping enough items to exceed my outside offer value. Let's try a few examples:\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** I give Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I keep [3, 2, 2, 4, 3].\n        *   My value: (3 * 15) + (2 * 60) + (2 * 96) + (4 * 2) + (3 * 68) = 45 + 120 + 192 + 8 + 204 = 569\n        *   Since 569 < 644, this offer is not good enough.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** I give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep [4, 3, 3, 5, 4].\n        *   My value: (4 * 15) + (3 * 60) + (3 * 96) + (5 * 2) + (4 * 68) = 60 + 180 + 288 + 10 + 272 = 810\n        *   Since 810 > 644, this is a good starting point.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 3:** I give Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep [3, 3, 3, 5, 4].\n        *   My value: (3 * 15) + (3 * 60) + (3 * 96) + (5 * 2) + (4 * 68) = 45 + 180 + 288 + 10 + 272 = 795\n        *   Since 795 > 644, this is also a good starting point.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I should definitely not accept. I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 644.\n\nSince this is the first round, I want to start with an offer that is favorable to me but not too extreme so that the other player might accept. Let's offer Player 1 only one unit of item 1.\nI offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. This gives me a value of 795.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 599. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 3 + 64 x 2 + 79 x 2 + 31 x 2 + 49 x 4\n    which is 598 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 599. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, let's proceed step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 599.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1 = 18\n     - Item 2 = 64\n     - Item 3 = 79\n     - Item 4 = 31\n     - Item 5 = 49\n   - The total pool of items is [4, 3, 3, 5, 4].\n   - The current offer on the table (items being offered to me) is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n   - The discount factor of 0.9 applies, but since we are still in the second round, the immediate decision is more impactful.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers**:\n   - **Current Offer**: If I accept this offer, I receive 1 unit of Item 1. My value for Item 1 is 18. Therefore, my total value would be 18.\n   - **My Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose a split that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 599.\n\n   Let's consider a split that meets this threshold. I will ensure I keep enough items so my total value exceeds 599:\n\n   - Keeping [4, 3, 2, 2, 4] gives me:\n     - 4 units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 18 = 72\n     - 3 units of Item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n     - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n     - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n     - 4 units of Item 5 = 4 \u00d7 49 = 196\n     - Total value = 680\n\n   Since 680 is greater than my outside offer of 599, this is a valid counteroffer. I will keep the remaining units and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n3) **Make a Decision**: \n   Considering the current value offers and potential counteroffers:\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 18, which is worse than my outside offer of 599.\n   - Walking away now would yield my outside offer of 599.\n   - Making a counteroffer where my value is 680 is preferable unless I expect a better deal later.\n\nBased on this calculation and analysis, the strategic move is to propose a counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]}",

This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n      - My value from this offer: (0 * 15) + (0 * 60) + (1 * 96) + (3 * 2) + (0 * 68) = 0 + 0 + 96 + 6 + 0 = 102.\n      - Discounted value of accepting the current offer: 102 * 0.9 = 91.8\n      - This is much less than my outside offer of 644.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer where what *I keep* is worth more than 644. Let's start by figuring out what I have if I reject the current offer of [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]. This means Player 1 has offered me 1 unit of item 3 and 3 units of item 4.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 644. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 1 + 60 x 1 + 96 x 3 + 2 x 4 + 68 x 4\n    which is 643 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 644.

This means they want me to have 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n     - My value if I accept: (0 * 34) + (1 * 91) + (1 * 15) + (4 * 47) + (0 * 4) = 0 + 91 + 15 + 188 + 0 = 294\n     - Since 294 < 685, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\n   - **Consider the items I would keep if I accept:**\n      - Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2\n      - Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n      - Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n      - Item 4: 6 - 4 = 2\n      - Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n      - Value if I keep these items: (2 * 34) + (4 * 91) + (2 * 15) + (2 * 47) + (2 * 4) = 68 + 364 + 30 + 94 + 8 = 564.\n   \n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer where the value of what I keep is greater than 685.\n\n   - I will calculate the total value of all items:\n   (2 * 34) + (5 * 91) + (3 * 15) + (6 * 47) + (2 * 4) = 68 + 455 + 45 + 282 + 8 = 858.\n\nLet's try to construct an offer that is better for me than my outside offer. I want to keep the most valuable items and give away the least valuable. I need my kept items to be worth more than 685.\n\nI currently have:\nItem 1: 34\nItem 2: 91\nItem 3: 15\nItem 4: 47\nItem 5: 4\n\nI need to make at least 685 to beat my outside offer.\n\nTry offer [2, 4, 3, 6, 2] to Player 1 (give away nothing, keep everything), so keeping [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nValue: 91 < 685. This is too low\n\nWhat if I give them [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]?\nI would keep [2, 3, 3, 4, 2]\nValue: 2*34 + 3*91 + 3*15 + 4*47 + 2*4 = 68 + 273 + 45 + 188 + 8 = 582. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nTry offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1\nI keep everything, value is 858 > 685.\n\nSince it is round 2, the discounted outside option for me would be 0.9 * 685 = 616.5.\nThe current offer's value is still far below the outside offer, even with discounting.\nLet's propose offering nothing.\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 984. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 984. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1161 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 37 x 2 + 95 x 2 + 88 x 6 + 95 x 2\n    which is 982 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 984. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 4, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 4, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 723. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 786 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 7, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 2 + 63 x 4 + 13 x 7 + 30 x 0 + 67 x 3\n    which is 722 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 723. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Items 1, 2, and 5 have the highest per unit value and should be prioritized for retention.\n   - Consider keeping 3 of each of items 1 and 2, none of item 3, and 2 of items 4 and 5 because item 4 has the next highest value per unit.\n\n   Calculation for what I keep if I offer [1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5] to Player 2:\n   - Keep 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n   - Keep 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n   - Keep 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   - Keep 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n   - Keep 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 60 = 120\n\n   Total value = 189 + 189 + 0 + 48 + 120 = 546\n\n   This is not greater than my outside offer of 612, so let's iterate.\n\n   Adjust the offer:\n   - Reduce items offered further to maximize my value, keep 4 units of item 1 and re-evaluate.\n\n   Calculation for what I keep if I offer [0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5] to Player 2:\n   - Keep 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 63 = 252\n   - Keep 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 63 = 252\n   - Keep 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   - Keep 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n   - Keep 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 60 = 120\n\n   Total value = 252 + 252 + 0 + 48 + 120 = 672\n\n   This is greater than my outside offer of 612, so this offer is acceptable to me.\n\nTherefore, the action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 5, 2, 1]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1075. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1075. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1035 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 5, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 0 + 55 x 5 + 85 x 5 + 53 x 4 + 81 x 2\n    which is 1074 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1075. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 5, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 5, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1075\n*   My values for items: item 1 = 71, item 2 = 55, item 3 = 85, item 4 = 53, item 5 = 81\n*   Total items: 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 5, 2, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 0 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 71) + (2 * 55) + (5 * 85) + (2 * 53) + (1 * 81) = 0 + 110 + 425 + 106 + 81 = 722\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (722) is significantly less than my outside offer (1075).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1075. Since Player 1's offer is weak, I have room to propose a deal that favors me.  The total value of all items to me is 1494.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 the following: [4, 4, 0, 4, 0] This means I keep:\n*   Item 1: 0 units\n*   Item 2: 2 units\n*   Item 3: 5 units\n*   Item 4: 0 units\n*   Item 5: 3 units\n\nValue of my kept items: (0 * 71) + (2 * 55) + (5 * 85) + (0 * 53) + (3 * 81) = 0 + 110 + 425 + 0 + 243 = 778\n\nThis offer is not good enough. I need to keep more value. Let's try another counteroffer: [2, 4, 2, 2, 2]. This means I keep:\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 2 units\n*   Item 3: 3 units\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 1 unit\n\nValue of my kept items: (2 * 71) + (2 * 55) + (3 * 85) + (2 * 53) + (1 * 81) = 142 + 110 + 255 + 106 + 81 = 694\n\nThis is also no good. I will try the following counter offer: [2, 5, 4, 4, 3] This means I keep:\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 1 units\n*   Item 3: 1 units\n*   Item 4: 0 units\n*   Item 5: 0 unit\n\nValue of my kept items: (2 * 71) + (1 * 55) + (1 * 85) + (0 * 53) + (0 * 81) = 142 + 55 + 85 + 0 + 0 = 282\n\nThis is terrible. Okay, I will now try the following: [1, 3, 2, 2, 1] This means I keep:\n*   Item 1: 3 units\n*   Item 2: 3 units\n*   Item 3: 3 units\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 2 units\n\nValue of my kept items: (3 * 71) + (3 * 55) + (3 * 85) + (2 * 53) + (2 * 81) = 213 + 165 + 255 + 106 + 162 = 901\n\nThis still isn't great. I will try the following: [0, 3, 3, 2, 0] This means I keep:\n*   Item 1: 4 units\n*   Item 2: 3 units\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 3 units\n\nValue of my kept items: (4 * 71) + (3 * 55) + (2 * 85) + (2 * 53) + (3 * 81) = 284 + 165 + 170 + 106 + 243 = 968\n\nLet's try the following: [0, 4, 4, 3, 0]. This means I keep:\n* Item 1: 4 units\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 1 unit\n* Item 4: 1 unit\n* Item 5: 3 units\n\nValue of my kept items: (4 * 71) + (2 * 55) + (1 * 85) + (1 * 53) + (3 * 81) = 284 + 110 + 85 + 53 + 243 = 775.\n\nLets try the following [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] This means I keep:\n* Item 1: 4 units\n* Item 2: 6 units\n* Item 3: 5 units\n* Item 4: 4 units\n* Item 5: 3 units\n\nValue of my kept items: (4 * 71) + (6 * 55) + (5 * 85) + (4 * 53) + (3 * 81) = 284 + 330 + 425 + 212 + 243 = 1494\n\nOkay, let's try to meet somewhere in the middle. I'm going to try offering [2, 3, 3, 2, 1] This means I keep:\n* Item 1: 2 units\n* Item 2: 3 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\nValue of my kept items: (2 * 71) + (3 * 55) + (2 * 85) + (2 * 53) + (2 * 81) = 142 + 165 + 170 + 106 + 162 = 745\n\nOkay, I need to offer more so that I get more items.\n\nLet's try [1, 2, 2, 1, 0] This means I keep\n* Item 1: 3 units\n* Item 2: 4 units\n* Item 3: 3 units\n* Item 4: 3 units\n* Item 5: 3 units\nValue of my kept items: 213 + 220 + 255 + 159 + 243 = 1090\n\nThis seems better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable. I will make the counteroffer of [1, 2, 2, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1075. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1075. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1035 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 5, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 0 + 55 x 5 + 85 x 5 + 53 x 4 + 81 x 2\n    which is 1074 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1075. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 5, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1075\n*   My values per unit: item 1: 71, item 2: 55, item 3: 85, item 4: 53, item 5: 81\n*   Total items: item 1: 4, item 2: 6, item 3: 5, item 4: 4, item 5: 3\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 6 - 1 = 5\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n    Value of current offer: (3 * 71) + (5 * 55) + (4 * 85) + (3 * 53) + (2 * 81) = 213 + 275 + 340 + 159 + 162 = 1149\n\nSince this is round 2, the value is discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nDiscounted value = 1149 * 0.9 = 1034.1.\n\n*   This discounted value (1034.1) is less than my outside offer of 1075. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   Let's consider a possible counteroffer: I need to get a value higher than 1075 after applying the discount factor. So the offer needs to be worth more than 1075/0.9 = 1194.44.\n    I want to maximize my own value. I will make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, assuming Player 1 will accept it.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. I should not accept. I should not walk away immediately as there's still another round to play. Let's craft a counteroffer.\n\nI will try to give away items that I value less and keep more of the items I value highly.\nHow about I offer Player 1 [2, 3, 3, 2, 2]?\nThis means I keep [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]. My value would be: (2*71) + (3*55) + (2*85) + (2*53) + (1*81) = 142 + 165 + 170 + 106 + 81 = 664. Discounted by 0.9, this is 597.6, which is very bad. I need to keep much more.\n\nI want to aim for around 1195 before discounting.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [0, 2, 3, 2, 1].\nThis means I keep [4, 4, 2, 2, 2]. My value would be: (4*71) + (4*55) + (2*85) + (2*53) + (2*81) = 284 + 220 + 170 + 106 + 162 = 942. Discounted by 0.9, this is 847.8, which is still worse than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0].\nThis means I keep [4, 5, 4, 3, 3]. My value would be: (4*71) + (5*55) + (4*85) + (3*53) + (3*81) = 284 + 275 + 340 + 159 + 243 = 1301.\nDiscounted by 0.9, this is 1170.9. This is still better than my outside offer after the discount.\n\nI'll go with the offer [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n1) Current Situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 879.\n   - The values of the items involved are: \n     - Item 1: 83\n     - Item 2: 98\n     - Item 3: 69\n     - Item 4: 23\n     - Item 5: 59\n   - The total pool of items:\n     - 2 units of item 1, \n     - 3 units of item 2,\n     - 2 units of item 3,\n     - 5 units of item 4,\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor is 0.9, but as it's the first round, there's no discount applied for immediate proposals.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer to evaluate in terms of acceptance.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I need to ensure that my retained value exceeds my outside offer.\n   \n   Let's calculate a possible division that would ensure I secure more than my outside offer of 879. A possible initial offer might maximize the items that have higher values for me.\n\n   - I can try keeping all units of item 2 and mix in other items to maximize my return:\n     - [1, 0, 2, 3, 2] offered to Player 2:\n       - I keep 1 unit of item 1, worth 83.\n       - I keep 3 units of item 2, worth 294 (98 x 3).\n       - I keep 0 units of item 3, worth 0.\n       - I keep 2 units of item 4, worth 46 (23 x 2).\n       - I keep 1 unit of item 5, worth 59.\n     Total retained value = 83 + 294 + 46 + 59 = 482.\n\n   This total is significantly below my outside offer value of 879. Let's try another approach by keeping more of high-value items:\n\n   - [0, 0, 1, 5, 1] offered to Player 2:\n       - I keep 2 units of item 1, worth 166 (83 x 2).\n       - I keep 3 units of item 2, worth 294 (98 x 3).\n       - I keep 1 units of item 3, worth 69 (69 x 1).\n       - I keep 0 units of item 4, worth 0.\n       - I keep 2 units of item 5, worth 118 (59 x 2).\n     Total retained value = 166 + 294 + 69 + 0 + 118 = 647.\n\n   Again, this is not more than my outside offer. I should adjust my offer to include most of the high-value items.\n\n   - [0, 0, 1, 3, 1] offered to Player 2:\n       - I keep 2 units of item 1, worth 166 (83 x 2).\n       - I keep 3 units of item 2, worth 294 (98 x 3).\n       - I keep 1 units of item 3, worth 69 (69 x 1).\n       - I keep 2 units of item 4, worth 46 (23 x 2).\n       - I keep 2 units of item 5, worth 118 (59 x 2).\n     Total retained value = 166 + 294 + 69 + 46 + 118 = 693.\n\n   Since this does not exceed my outside offer, let's try one more configuration:\n\n   - [0, 0, 1, 2, 0] offered to Player 2:\n       - I keep 2 units of item 1, worth 166 (83 x 2).\n       - I keep 3 units of item 2, worth 294 (98 x 3).\n       - I keep 1 units of item 3, worth 69 (69 x 1).\n       - I keep 3 units of item 4, worth 69 (23 x 3).\n       - I keep 3 units of item 5, worth 177 (59 x 3).\n     Total retained value = 166 + 294 + 69 + 69 + 177 = 775.\n\n   Since this approach still does not fulfill the condition of being greater than 879, I will need to maximize my hold on items 1, 2, and 5, which are of high value.\n\n3) Therefore, attempting a new schema:\n\nGiven restrictions and attempt viability, my reasonable counteroffer ensuring all mathematical values taken into account is inefficient, balances to:\n\n- [0, 0, 1, 2, 2].\n\nThe recalculated values show now I can offer [1, 0, 2, 5, 1]\n- I keep:\n  - 1 unit of item 1, worth 83\n  - 3 unit of item 2, worth 294\n  - 0 unit of item 3, worth 0\n  - 0 unit of item 4, worth 0\n  - 2 units of item 5, worth 118  \n  Total value = 495 \n\nUltimately, none of the combinations naturally produce a figure matching or exceeding 879, demonstrating unrealistic offer assumptions out of workable practical calculations leading to exceeding under conditions, signifying non-optimal negotiations inside pre-rounds direct walkthrough plan without non-existent current provider.\n\nDecision:\nGiven that no achievable counteroffer affords satisfaction above 879, my logical strategic choice given max available: \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 70 x 0 + 43 x 5 + 57 x 3 + 1 x 4\n    which is 390 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 391. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, I should look to adjust further the units offered and retained.\n\n**Adjustment:**\n\nLet me re-evaluate with a new plan:\n\nKeep [2, 2, 3, 2, 6] (and offer: [2, 2, 4, 2, 0]):\n- Value calculation:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 87 = 174\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 70 = 140\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 43 = 129\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 57 = 114\n  - 6 units of item 5 = 6 * 1 = 6\n- Total value = 174 + 140 + 129 + 114 + 6 = 563\n\nThe value of this setup (563) is above my outside offer, making it a valid and superior counteroffer.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo exceed my outside offer and make a viable proposition, my counteroffer is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 4, 2, 0]}\n```",

This means I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 77 = 154\n    *   2 units of item 2 = 2 * 97 = 194\n    *   4 units of item 3 = 4 * 69 = 276\n    *   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 85 = 170\n    *   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 92 = 0\n    *   Total value = 154 + 194 + 276 + 170 + 0 = 794\n    *   Discounted value = 794 * 0.9^(2-1) = 714.6\n\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer (714.6) is significantly less than my outside offer (1606).\n\n*   **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to offer something to Player 1 while keeping enough for myself to exceed my outside offer (accounting for the discount factor). Since it is round 2, the value is discounted by 0.9. To exceed my outside offer, I would need a undiscounted value exceeding 1606/0.9 = 1784.44.\n\nLet's consider keeping:\n\n*   4 units of item 1\n*   4 units of item 2\n*   6 units of item 5\n*   And no items of types 3 or 4\n\nThat would provide:\n*   item 1 = 4 * 77 = 308\n*   item 2 = 4 * 97 = 388\n*   item 5 = 6 * 92 = 552\n*   Total 308 + 388 + 552 = 1248\n\nThis is not above 1784.

Let's try to leave nothing on the table for Player 1.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I should reject the current offer and make a counteroffer. The goal is to obtain more value than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. Let's offer the minimal amount to Player 1 to see if that will exceed my outside offer of 1606. To exceed my outside offer given round 2, I need to have a total value greater than 1606 / 0.9 = 1784.44.\n\nLet me try to keep 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\n* 4 * 77 = 308\n* 4 * 97 = 388\n* 7 * 69 = 483\n* 4 * 85 = 340\n* 5 * 92 = 460\n\n308 + 388 + 483 + 340 + 460 = 1979 > 1784.44\n\nSo, I should offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] to Player 1\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 391. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 774 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 70 x 0 + 43 x 5 + 57 x 3 + 1 x 4\n    which is 390 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 391. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 4, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Making a Decision:\n   - I want to keep at least 583/total unit value without overshooting.\n\nLet's calculate a potential division that maximizes my value over my outside offer:\n\n- Aim to propose an initial division where the leftover value to me is significantly higher than 583.\n  \nExample division:\n\n- Keep: [1, 5, 0, 4, 4] (and offer [1, 3, 2, 2, 2] to Player 2)\n  - Value for me: (1 x 85) + (5 x 95) + (0 x 56) + (4 x 59) + (4 x 65)\n  - Calculate: 85 + 475 + 0 + 236 + 260 = 1056\n\nThis division gives me a total slightly over my external offer without going deep into the potential value loss if rounds proceed with discounting.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 2, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 805. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 2, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 66 x 6 + 56 x 2 + 22 x 4 + 52 x 4\n    which is 804 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 805. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 805\n*   My values for the items: item 1: 47, item 2: 66, item 3: 56, item 4: 22, item 5: 52\n*   Total pool of items: item 1: 2, item 2: 8, item 3: 2, item 4: 6, item 5: 6\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 3, 2, 2, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n    My total value if I accept this offer would be: (1 * 47) + (3 * 66) + (2 * 56) + (2 * 22) + (2 * 52) = 47 + 198 + 112 + 44 + 104 = 505.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (505) is much lower than my outside offer (805). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 805. Let's consider a few scenarios to illustrate the process. I will focus on maximizing my value while making it somewhat appealing to the other player.\n    Let me propose an offer where I keep [2, 6, 2, 4, 4] and offer [0, 2, 0, 2, 2] to player 1.\n    My value: 2 * 47 + 6 * 66 + 2 * 56 + 4 * 22 + 4 * 52 = 94 + 396 + 112 + 88 + 208 = 998, which is significantly better than the outside offer.\n    Let me propose an offer where I keep [2, 7, 2, 5, 5] and offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] to player 1.\n    My value: 2 * 47 + 7 * 66 + 2 * 56 + 5 * 22 + 5 * 52 = 94 + 462 + 112 + 110 + 260 = 1038, which is significantly better than the outside offer.\n    Let me propose an offer where I keep [2, 8, 2, 6, 6] and offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1.\n    My value: 2 * 47 + 8 * 66 + 2 * 56 + 6 * 22 + 6 * 52 = 94 + 528 + 112 + 132 + 312 = 1178, which is the maximum possible value.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (505) is far worse than my outside offer (805), I should not accept. Offering nothing to Player 1 is unlikely to be accepted.\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside offer and potentially acceptable to Player 1. Considering the total units available and my item valuations, I will propose giving Player 1 very few units of items.\nI propose offering Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] and keeping [2, 7, 2, 5, 5] for myself. This gives me a value of 1038, as calculated above.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1042. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1042\n*   **My values of the items:** item 1: 95, item 2: 28, item 3: 94, item 4: 89, item 5: 49\n*   **Total pool of items:** item 1: 3, item 2: 5, item 3: 2, item 4: 4, item 5: 7\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer later is worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 3]. This means I keep:\n    *   item 1: 1 unit offered, 3 - 1 = 2 units kept\n    *   item 2: 2 units offered, 5 - 2 = 3 units kept\n    *   item 3: 0 units offered, 2 - 0 = 2 units kept\n    *   item 4: 2 units offered, 4 - 2 = 2 units kept\n    *   item 5: 3 units offered, 7 - 3 = 4 units kept\n\n    My value for this offer is:\n    (2 * 95) + (3 * 28) + (2 * 94) + (2 * 89) + (4 * 49) = 190 + 84 + 188 + 178 + 196 = 836\n\n    Comparing to my outside offer: 836 < 1042. So, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that gives me a value greater than 1042. Also, it would be smart to determine the maximum I can get by taking everything. 3*95 + 5*28 + 2*94 + 4*89 + 7*49 = 285 + 140 + 188 + 356 + 343 = 1312\n    Let's test an offer where I give away [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything, and get value 1312, greater than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try an offer which is more reasonable to test the logic - say I offer away 1 of each item: [1,1,1,1,1].\n    This means I keep 2 item 1, 4 item 2, 1 item 3, 3 item 4, 6 item 5\n    2*95 + 4*28 + 1*94 + 3*89 + 6*49 = 190 + 112 + 94 + 267 + 294 = 957\n    Still less than my outside offer.\n\n    Since I have 3 rounds and a discount factor of 0.9, I could aim to get close to 1042 * (1/0.9) = 1157 (close means at least that much to give the other player an incentive to not walk in the last round).\n\n    Let's make a counteroffer where I keep more of the valuable items. How about offering [0, 2, 0, 1, 3] to Player 1.\n    Then I keep [3, 3, 2, 3, 4], which is a value of\n    3*95 + 3*28 + 2*94 + 3*89 + 4*49 = 285 + 84 + 188 + 267 + 196 = 1020. Still too low!\n\n    Let's aim higher! Offer Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 2].\n    Then I keep [3, 4, 2, 4, 5], value of\n    3*95 + 4*28 + 2*94 + 4*89 + 5*49 = 285 + 112 + 188 + 356 + 245 = 1186\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept.\nI calculated a counteroffer that yields 1186 which is greater than my outside offer of 1042.\nThe counteroffer is [0, 1, 0, 0, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1042. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 2, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 3 + 28 x 2 + 94 x 2 + 89 x 3 + 49 x 5\n    which is 1041 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1042. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 3, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 3, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1042\n*   My item values: item 1 = 95, item 2 = 28, item 3 = 94, item 4 = 89, item 5 = 49\n*   Total items: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 2, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 7\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 1, 3, 5]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   3 units of item 4\n    *   5 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 95) + (2 * 28) + (1 * 94) + (3 * 89) + (5 * 49) = 0 + 56 + 94 + 267 + 245 = 662\n\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value of this offer is 662 * 0.9 = 595.8. This is less than my outside offer of 1042, so accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Consider keeping everything:**\n    If I keep all the items, my value is: (3 * 95) + (5 * 28) + (2 * 94) + (4 * 89) + (7 * 49) = 285 + 140 + 188 + 356 + 343 = 1312\n\n3) **Develop a counteroffer:**\n\nI need to develop a counteroffer that is worth at least my outside option of 1042 * 0.9 = 937.8 when discounted by the round. This means that my offer must be worth more than 1042.\n\nI need to propose an offer where the items I keep have a value of at least 1042.\n\nLet's start by considering keeping most of the items.\nLet's say I offer Player 1 one unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, zero units of item 3, zero units of item 4 and zero units of item 5.\n\nMy kept items would then be:\n* Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units * 95 = 190\n* Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3 units * 28 = 84\n* Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 units * 94 = 188\n* Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4 units * 89 = 356\n* Item 5: 7 - 0 = 7 units * 49 = 343\n\nTotal Value = 190 + 84 + 188 + 356 + 343 = 1161\n\nGiven the discount factor, offering Player 1 [1, 2, 0, 0, 0] leads to me securing 1161.\n\n1161 * 0.9 is still bigger than 1042 so I will still make more than my outside option.\n\n4) **Decision:**\nI should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

However, as rounds progress, the effective value I can gain diminishes if the negotiation is delayed.\n\n2) **Assessment of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer Value:** None (since no offer is on the table from Player 2)\n   - **Counteroffer Assessment:** \n     - I need to propose a counteroffer that satisfies my value requirement above my outside offer (246). \n     - I will calculate potential offers to maximize the value I keep.\n\n3) **Counteroffer Calculation:**\n   - I want an offer that exceeds my outside value of 246.\n   \n   Let's try to calculate the value of specific scenarios:\n\n   - If I keep [3, 5, 3, 2, 1], this means I offer [2, 2, 0, 5, 1] to Player 2.\n     - My value calculation:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n       - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 96 = 480\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 36 = 36\n     - Total value = 849\n   - Since 849 is much higher than 246, this counteroffer keeps my payoff well above my outside offer.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n    - Based on the calculation, I should make a counteroffer that ensures my value is above my outside option.\n\nTherefore, the optimal action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 5, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 528. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 555 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 1 + 7 x 2 + 98 x 3 + 25 x 5 + 39 x 2\n    which is 527 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 528. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 5, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 5, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 528\n*   **Values of the items:** item 1 = 16, item 2 = 7, item 3 = 98, item 4 = 25, item 5 = 39\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 2, 0, 5, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 7 - 2 = 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 5 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   My value for this offer is: (3 * 16) + (5 * 7) + (3 * 98) + (2 * 25) + (1 * 39) = 48 + 35 + 294 + 50 + 39 = 466\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 466, which is less than my outside offer of 528.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not good enough, as it is less than my outside offer. So I should not ACCEPT.\n*   I should not WALK, as it's only round 1 and there are potentially better offers to be made.\n*   Therefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\nNow, let's try to find a reasonable counteroffer. I want to aim for something that gives me value higher than my outside offer (528). I value item 3 highly, so I should try to keep as much of that as possible.\n\nHere's a strategy: Start by giving Player 1 almost everything except item 3, then adjust a bit at a time.\n\nCounteroffer attempt 1: Give Player 1 [5, 7, 0, 7, 2]. This gives me [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]. My value is (3 * 98) = 294. This is far too low.\n\nCounteroffer attempt 2: Let me keep all of item 3 and item 5. [5, 7, 0, 7, 0]. This gives me [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]. My value is (3 * 98) + (2 * 39) = 294 + 78 = 372. This is still far too low.\n\nCounteroffer attempt 3: Let me keep all of item 3, item 5, and a bit of item 1. [4, 7, 0, 7, 0]. This gives me [1, 0, 3, 0, 2]. My value is (1 * 16) + (3 * 98) + (2 * 39) = 16 + 294 + 78 = 388. This is still far too low.\n\nCounteroffer attempt 4: Let me keep all of item 3, item 5, and a bit of item 1 and item 2. [4, 6, 0, 7, 0]. This gives me [1, 1, 3, 0, 2]. My value is (1 * 16) + (1 * 7) + (3 * 98) + (2 * 39) = 16 + 7 + 294 + 78 = 395. Still too low.\n\nCounteroffer attempt 5: Let me keep all of item 3, item 5, and a bit of item 1, item 2, and item 4. [4, 6, 0, 6, 0]. This gives me [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]. My value is (1 * 16) + (1 * 7) + (3 * 98) + (1 * 25) + (2 * 39) = 16 + 7 + 294 + 25 + 78 = 420. Still too low.\n\nI need to consider the discount factor if negotiations proceed.\n\nCounteroffer attempt 6: Try to keep enough to reach outside offer. I'll keep 2 item 1, 3 item 2, 3 item 3, 2 item 4, and 2 item 5 for myself. Offer is [3, 4, 0, 5, 0]. My value is (2 * 16) + (3 * 7) + (3 * 98) + (2 * 25) + (2 * 39) = 32 + 21 + 294 + 50 + 78 = 475.\nKeep 3 item 1, 4 item 2, 3 item 3, 3 item 4, and 2 item 5 for myself. Offer is [2, 3, 0, 4, 0]. My value is (3 * 16) + (4 * 7) + (3 * 98) + (3 * 25) + (2 * 39) = 48 + 28 + 294 + 75 + 78 = 523\nKeep 3 item 1, 4 item 2, 3 item 3, 4 item 4, and 2 item 5 for myself. Offer is [2, 3, 0, 3, 0]. My value is (3 * 16) + (4 * 7) + (3 * 98) + (4 * 25) + (2 * 39) = 48 + 28 + 294 + 100 + 78 = 548.\n\nThis counteroffer is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 59 x 4 + 71 x 3 + 86 x 6 + 26 x 0\n    which is 965 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 966. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

As rounds progress, value will be multiplied by gamma (0.9).\n\n2) **Assessment of Offers:**\n   - As there is no current offer from Player 2, we need to consider our initial counteroffers.\n   - To propose a successful counteroffer, it must have a value greater than 966 to us.\n   - Let's assess potential counteroffer by keeping items that allow us to reach a value greater than our outside offer.\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffer Calculation:**\n   - Start from the highest value items.\n   - Aim for a total value slightly more than 966 to offset any risk from discount in next rounds.\n   - Example counteroffer: Offer Player 2 a split where I keep slightly more than my outside offer.\n\n   Keep items like:\n   - 0 units of Item 1 = 0\n   - 4 units of Item 2 = 236\n   - 5 units of Item 3 = 355\n   - 6 units of Item 4 = 516 (7 x 86 - 86 unit offered)\n   - 0 units of Item 5 = 0\n\n   Total value: 0 + 236 + 355 + 516 + 0 = 1107\n\nSince 1107 is more than 966, this counteroffer is valid.

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: Player 1 offers [3, 0, 0, 1, 4]. This means I receive:\n     - Item 1: 3\n     - Item 2: 0\n     - Item 3: 0\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 4\n    My value for accepting is: (3 * 94) + (0 * 59) + (0 * 2) + (1 * 68) + (4 * 10) = 282 + 0 + 0 + 68 + 40 = 390\n\n3) Decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me 390, which is less than my outside offer of 525. Therefore, I should not accept this offer (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away gives me 525.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 525. I have a total value of 1044, and I need to keep enough items such that my value is higher than 525.\nI want to keep items that are most valuable to me.\n\nLet's try keeping all of item 1 (3 units), item 2 (4 units), some of item 4 (say, 4 units), and none of the other items:\nValue: (3 * 94) + (4 * 59) + (0 * 2) + (4 * 68) + (0 * 10) = 282 + 236 + 0 + 272 + 0 = 790\nThis is much greater than 525.  So, I can offer away all of item 3 and item 5, and the remaining units of item 4. That would be [3, 4, 5, 3, 4] to Player 1.\n\nLet's try another counteroffer. How about offering [0, 0, 5, 7, 4]? This leaves me with:\n3 units of item 1: 3 * 94 = 282\n4 units of item 2: 4 * 59 = 236\n0 units of item 3: 0\n0 units of item 4: 0\n0 units of item 5: 0\nTotal value: 518. This is less than my outside offer, so it is Mistake 2.\n\nTherefore, I'll stick with my first counteroffer and propose [3, 4, 5, 3, 4]. This gives player 1 nothing of item 1, nothing of item 2, nothing of item 3, 4 units of item 4, nothing of item 5. I keep all of item 1 and item 2, and offer away all the items 3 and item 5. Of item 4, I keep 3 units. My value is 790.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 5, 3, 4]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 51 x 3 + 58 x 2 + 83 x 0 + 60 x 0\n    which is 269 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 270. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 51 x 3 + 58 x 2 + 83 x 0 + 60 x 0\n    which is 269 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 270. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Multiplying by gamma (as it's round 2, gamma^1 = 0.9) gives a discounted value of:\n     - Discounted value = 628 \u00d7 0.9 = 565.2\n\n3) **Make a decision**:\n\n   - **Should I accept the current offer?** Yes, as the discounted value of the current offer (565.2) is far greater than my outside offer (270).\n   - **Should I walk away?** No, since the current offer clearly provides more value than my outside option.\n   - **Should I propose a counteroffer?** No, since the current offer is already beneficial and negotiating further with a good offer on the table could be risky.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most rational action is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 373. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1263 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 94 x 0 + 48 x 2 + 92 x 3 + 88 x 0\n    which is 372 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 373. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 373.\n- **Values of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 99 per unit\n  - Item 2: 94 per unit\n  - Item 3: 48 per unit\n  - Item 4: 92 per unit\n  - Item 5: 88 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - 4 units of Item 1\n  - 4 units of Item 2\n  - 3 units of Item 3\n  - 3 units of Item 4\n  - 6 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount rate of 0.9 means the value of outcomes is decremented the longer the negotiation takes. This means it is preferable to secure a good deal early if possible.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nThere is currently no offer on the table, so I will focus on creating a counteroffer that maximizes my value.\n\n#### Calculating Value of Potential Counteroffers:\n\nTo ensure I don't propose an offer that violates Mistake 2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer), I need to ensure the kept items have a value > 373.\n\nFor a potential initial counteroffer, consider maximizing high-value items under the available unit constraints. Aim to retain items that maximize utility given their scarcity and value:\n\n1. Let's aim to keep all 4 units of Item 1 and 4 units of Item 2, since they have the highest per-unit value.\n2. Since Item 4 is valuable as well, aim to retain as many units as possible.\n3. Distribute remaining items to reach a solution where my total value exceeds 373.\n\nLet's attempt this division:\n\n- **Offer to Player 2:** \n  - 0 units of Item 1\n  - 0 units of Item 2\n  - 1 unit of Item 3\n  - 0 units of Item 4 \n  - 2 units of Item 5\n\nMy kept items:\n- 4 units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 99 = 396\n- 4 units of Item 2 = 4 \u00d7 94 = 376\n- 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n- 3 units of Item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n- 4 units of Item 5 = 4 \u00d7 88 = 352\n\nTotal personal value = 396 + 376 + 96 + 276 + 352 = 1496\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- The value from my proposed division (1496) is far above my outside offer (373). Therefore, this offer is acceptable from my perspective.\n- I should propose the counteroffer as it provides a superior value compared to the fallback option.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 0 + 48 x 1 + 65 x 2 + 64 x 0 + 64 x 3\n    which is 370 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 376. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its face value. This incentivizes reaching an agreement earlier rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

The goal is to ensure that the value of items I keep is greater than my outside offer of 428.\n\n**Calculating Total Pool Value:**\n- Total pool = 6x56 + 4x26 + 7x10 + 4x23 + 3x66\n- = 336 + 104 + 70 + 92 + 198\n- = 800\n\nI aim to keep items that hold maximum value to me, ideally ensuring total value is over my outside offer of 428.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nTo avoid pitfalls like Mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer), I will calculate a viable counteroffer.\n\n#### Counteroffer Evaluation\nTo maximize my value, assume I would like to keep higher valued items predominantly, such as items 1 and 5 which have high unit values:\n- Offer Player 2: [2, 2, 4, 2, 1] (give away moderate amounts of various items)\n\n**My Remaining Items:**\n- Item 1: 4 (4 x 56 = 224)\n- Item 2: 2 (2 x 26 = 52)\n- Item 3: 3 (3 x 10 = 30)\n- Item 4: 2 (2 x 23 = 46)\n- Item 5: 2 (2 x 66 = 132)\n\n**Total Value of Kept Items:**\n- = 224 + 52 + 30 + 46 + 132\n- = 484\n\nThis total value is greater than my outside offer of 428, so it would be beneficial to me to make this initial offer.\n\n### Conclusion and Action\n\nGiven the calculations, I should propose an initial offer that ensures the items I retain provide a value greater than my outside offer of 428, maximizing my benefits from the negotiation process.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 4, 2, 1]}\n```",

As this is round 2, the current discount is 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer [1, 1, 3, 1, 1] gives me:\n     - 1 unit of Item 1: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n     - 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n     - 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n     - 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n     - 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n     - Total value = 56 + 26 + 30 + 23 + 66 = 201\n     - Discounted value = 201 \u00d7 0.9 = 180.9\n   - Comparing the current offer to my outside offer: 180.9 is significantly less than 428, so I should not accept this offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I should not walk away since I can propose a counteroffer that may be more beneficial.\n   - I need to find a counteroffer where what I keep is worth more than my outside offer of 428.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer that gives me more value:\n\nLet's consider what I should offer to Player 2. For instance, offering them [1, 2, 3, 1, 0] would mean I keep [5, 2, 4, 3, 3]:\n\n- Value of what I keep:\n  - 5 units of Item 1: 5 \u00d7 56 = 280\n  - 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n  - 4 units of Item 3: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n  - 3 units of Item 4: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n  - 3 units of Item 5: 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n  - Total value = 280 + 52 + 40 + 69 + 198 = 639\n\nThe value of this allocation (639) is significantly higher than my outside offer of 428. Therefore, this counteroffer is more beneficial to me under the current negotiation setup.\n\nCounteroffer format:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 3, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that accepting an offer later reduces its value to me.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 3, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1 * 63 = 63\n      - 2 units of item 2 * 63 = 126\n      - 3 units of item 3 * 17 = 51\n      - 1 unit of item 4 * 100 = 100\n      - 0 units of item 5 * 33 = 0\n      - Total value = 63 + 126 + 51 + 100 + 0 = 340\n\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer's value (340) is much lower than my outside offer (866).\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 866.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 7, 2, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 3 + 70 x 7 + 91 x 2 + 28 x 4 + 90 x 0\n    which is 826 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 829. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This is my guaranteed payoff if we fail to reach an agreement.\n*   **Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 95\n    *   Item 2: 88\n    *   Item 3: 48\n    *   Item 4: 22\n    *   Item 5: 63\n*   **Total Item Pool:** 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. This means that a deal in a later round is worth less than a deal in an earlier round.\n\n**2) Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer would be: (0 * 95) + (1 * 88) + (0 * 48) + (1 * 22) + (0 * 63) = 88 + 22 = 110.\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer is worth 110 to me. This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1292. Accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n**3) Consider a Counteroffer**\n\nI want to determine a counteroffer that yields a value to myself higher than my outside offer (1292). The available items are 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all the items:\n5 * 95 + 7 * 88 + 3 * 48 + 4 * 22 + 4 * 63 = 475 + 616 + 144 + 88 + 252 = 1575\nThis is better than my outside offer of 1292, so it's a possible offer.\n\nLet's try a slightly more generous offer. What if I offer the other player one unit of item 4: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]? That means I keep:\n5 * 95 + 7 * 88 + 3 * 48 + 3 * 22 + 4 * 63 = 475 + 616 + 144 + 66 + 252 = 1553\nStill above my outside offer. I will go with this counteroffer.\n\n**4) Decision:**\n\nThe current offer of 110 is far worse than my outside offer of 1292. Therefore, I should not accept. I will propose a counteroffer that is beneficial to me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 7, 3, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 4 + 88 x 7 + 48 x 3 + 22 x 4 + 63 x 1\n    which is 1291 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1292. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1292.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1: 95, item 2: 88, item 3: 48, item 4: 22, item 5: 63.\n   - The total pool of items is: 5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 2, the discount factor will be applied as 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 4, 0, 2, 0]. This means I would get:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 0 units of item 5\n     My value for this offer is: (1 * 95) + (4 * 88) + (0 * 48) + (2 * 22) + (0 * 63) = 95 + 352 + 0 + 44 + 0 = 491\n     Considering the discount factor, the present value of accepting the current offer is 491 * 0.9 = 441.9.\n     This is much less than my outside offer of 1292.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider potential counteroffers that would give me a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Explore a possible Counteroffer:**\n    Let's consider keeping most of the items and offering Player 1 relatively little. My outside offer value is 1292. Let's aim for a total value significantly above 1292 to account for the discount factor and potential future rounds.\n    I am going to keep 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5.\n    That means I would offer the other player:\n    - 1 unit of item 1\n    - 4 units of item 2\n    - 0 units of item 3\n    - 2 units of item 4\n    - 0 units of item 5\n    Which is the current offer that is on the table. I need to come up with a better offer for myself to improve on this.\n\n    I will offer the following items: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n    This means I am keeping 5 unit of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5.\n    My value for this offer would be: (5 * 95) + (7 * 88) + (3 * 48) + (3 * 22) + (4 * 63) = 475 + 616 + 144 + 66 + 252 = 1553. This value is much greater than my outside option.\n    Considering the discount factor, the present value of accepting the current offer is 1553 * 0.9 = 1397.7\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the value of my suggested offer is above my outside offer, I will propose the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 940. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 99 x 4 + 85 x 5 + 43 x 2 + 16 x 2\n    which is 939 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 940. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the optimal action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 940\n   - My values per unit of each item: item 1: 2, item 2: 99, item 3: 85, item 4: 43, item 5: 16\n   - Total pool of items: item 1: 5, item 2: 5, item 3: 5, item 4: 6, item 5: 4\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - Item 1: 2 units, value = 2 * 2 = 4\n      - Item 2: 3 units, value = 3 * 99 = 297\n      - Item 3: 2 units, value = 2 * 85 = 170\n      - Item 4: 2 units, value = 2 * 43 = 86\n      - Item 5: 1 units, value = 1 * 16 = 16\n      - Total value of current offer: 4 + 297 + 170 + 86 + 16 = 573\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 573 is less than my outside offer of 940. Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 940. I have a total of 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. If Player 1 offers me [2, 3, 2, 2, 1], they would be taking the remaining items:\n        - Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3\n        - Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2\n        - Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3\n        - Item 4: 6 - 2 = 4\n        - Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n\n  To find an appropriate counteroffer, let's start by allocating all items to myself and gradually shifting the values towards what Player 1 might accept, without falling below my outside offer. Let me propose that I give Player 1 the following: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This results in a value to me of :\n\n   5 units of item 1 = 5 * 2 = 10\n   5 units of item 2 = 5 * 99 = 495\n   5 units of item 3 = 5 * 85 = 425\n   6 units of item 4 = 6 * 43 = 258\n   4 units of item 5 = 4 * 16 = 64\n   Total value = 10 + 495 + 425 + 258 + 64 = 1252. Since this is far greater than my outside offer, there is room to make a generous counteroffer. \n\n    Let's see if offering them item 2 makes sense since it's their gain that gives me the greatest loss. What if I offered Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]? Then I have:\n    5 units of item 1 = 5 * 2 = 10\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 * 99 = 297\n    5 units of item 3 = 5 * 85 = 425\n    6 units of item 4 = 6 * 43 = 258\n    4 units of item 5 = 4 * 16 = 64\n    Total value = 10 + 297 + 425 + 258 + 64 = 1054, still greater than my outside offer of 940.\n\n    If the other player values item 2 enough, that deal might make sense. However, let's try to create a slightly more enticing offer.\n    What about [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]?\n    Then I have:\n    4 units of item 1 = 4 * 2 = 8\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 * 99 = 297\n    4 units of item 3 = 4 * 85 = 340\n    5 units of item 4 = 5 * 43 = 215\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 * 16 = 48\n    Total value = 8 + 297 + 340 + 215 + 48 = 908. This is less than my outside offer!\n\n    It seems like I need to make sure I keep more of item 3 or item 4 to make this deal above my outside offer.\n    Let's try [1, 2, 0, 1, 0].\n    Then I have:\n    4 units of item 1 = 4 * 2 = 8\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 * 99 = 297\n    5 units of item 3 = 5 * 85 = 425\n    5 units of item 4 = 5 * 43 = 215\n    4 units of item 5 = 4 * 16 = 64\n    Total value = 8 + 297 + 425 + 215 + 64 = 1009, which is greater than my outside offer. \n    This seems like a reasonable start. I will make this my counteroffer.\n\n3. **Make a decision:**\n\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   - A counteroffer of [1, 2, 0, 1, 0] is better than my outside offer.\n   - Therefore, I will make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Let's compute the value of different potential keeper allocations:\n\n   If I keep:\n   - Items: [3, 1, 2, 1, 3]\n   - My values from these would be:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 50 = 150\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 20 = 20\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 17 = 34\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 56 = 56\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 59 = 177\n   - Total value = 150 + 20 + 34 + 56 + 177 = 437 (too low)\n\n   Iterate further to find a better division:\n   - Keep the following: [4, 0, 3, 1, 3]\n   - My values from these:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 50 = 200\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 * 20 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 17 = 51\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 56 = 56\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 59 = 177\n   - Total value = 200 + 0 + 51 + 56 + 177 = 484 (still too low)\n\n   Finally, propose:\n   - Keep the following: [4, 2, 3, 0, 5]\n   - My values from these:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 50 = 200\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 20 = 40\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 17 = 51\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 * 56 = 0\n     - 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 59 = 295\n   - Total value = 200 + 40 + 51 + 0 + 295 = 586\n\n   This configuration yields a value of 586, which is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Given the analysis, the division [4, 2, 3, 0, 5] keeps me items with a value of 586.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 0 + 34 x 1 + 21 x 4 + 67 x 0 + 29 x 3\n    which is 205 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 206.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 206\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1 = 23, Item 2 = 34, Item 3 = 21, Item 4 = 67, Item 5 = 29\n*   **Total Items:** 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 2 units of item 1 and 2 units of item 3. The value of this offer to me is:\n    (2 * 23) + (0 * 34) + (2 * 21) + (0 * 67) + (0 * 29) = 46 + 0 + 42 + 0 + 0 = 88.\n\n    Since this is round 2, we need to account for the discount factor. The discounted value of accepting this offer is 88 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 88 * 0.9 = 79.2. This is much less than my outside offer of 206, so accepting this offer would be a Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Consider Walking Away:** Walking away would give me my outside offer value of 206.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's think about a reasonable counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while considering what Player 1 might accept.\n    *   I have the following items to distribute between myself and player 1:\n    Item 1: 6 units\n    Item 2: 3 units\n    Item 3: 5 units\n    Item 4: 1 units\n    Item 5: 5 units\n\n    I'll start with an initial guess for my counteroffer and then refine it. I want to keep item 4 (my highest value item). Let's try giving Player 1 [3, 1, 3, 0, 3]. This would leave me with:\n\n    Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 units\n    Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n\n    My value would be: (3 * 23) + (2 * 34) + (2 * 21) + (1 * 67) + (2 * 29) = 69 + 68 + 42 + 67 + 58 = 304\n\n    The discounted value of this counteroffer is 304 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 304 * 0.9 = 273.6. This is much better than walking away, so let's try it.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nI will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 3, 0, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 242. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 498 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 28 x 1 + 53 x 3 + 27 x 2 + 6 x 0\n    which is 241 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 242. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I need my division to have a total value more than 242.\n   - Let's calculate the value of various keeping scenarios:\n     - If I keep [3, 3, 3, 2, 0] and offer [3, 5, 2, 2, 3]:\n       - Value = \\( 3*52 + 3*28 + 3*53 + 2*27 + 0*6 = 156 + 84 + 159 + 54 + 0 = 453 \\)\n       - This value of 453 is significantly above my outside offer of 242.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Since my calculation shows keeping [3, 3, 3, 2, 0] is better than my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer to Player 2.\n\nGiven this analysis, my counteroffer will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 5, 2, 2, 3]}\n```",

However, if we delay into further rounds, it would affect the value of potential agreements due to the negotiation rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Potential Offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer from Player 2, I need to consider potential counteroffers.\n   - I need to propose a division where my total value is greater than 633 (my outside offer value).\n\n3) **Calculate Potential Offer Values:**\n   - If I keep [3, 0, 2, 5, 2], the value is:\n     - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n     - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n     - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 59 = 295\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n     - Total value = 99 + 0 + 132 + 295 + 102 = 628\n     - This is less than 633, so I won't choose this.\n\n   - Explore [2, 0, 2, 4, 2] to keep:\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n     - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n     - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 59 = 236\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n     - Total value = 66 + 0 + 132 + 236 + 102 = 536\n     - This is also less than 633.\n\n   - Let's try keeping [3, 0, 1, 5, 2]:\n     - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n     - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n     - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n     - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 59 = 295\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n     - Total value = 99 + 0 + 66 + 295 + 102 = 562\n   \n   - Now let's evaluate keeping [4, 0, 2, 5, 2]:\n     - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n     - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n     - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 59 = 295\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n     - Total value = 132 + 0 + 132 + 295 + 102 = 661\n     - This is more than 633 and is acceptable.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n   - Propose to keep [4, 0, 2, 5, 2] and offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] to Player 2. This ensures my total value is 661, which is better than my outside offer of 633.\n\nFinal Action:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 66. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 642 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 1 + 15 x 0 + 17 x 0 + 90 x 0 + 35 x 0\n    which is 57 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 66. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 66\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 57, Item 2: 15, Item 3: 17, Item 4: 90, Item 5: 35\n*   **Total items:** 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** 0.9.

This leaves Player 1 with 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 57) + (0 * 15) + (0 * 17) + (1 * 90) + (1 * 35) = 125\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 125, which is greater than my outside offer of 66.\n\n*   **Consider a counteroffer:** Let's consider what a minimal counteroffer would be. In this case, I have already been given an offer more than my outside option, and this is the first round, so it may be beneficial to give the other player a better offer for a better outcome.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer of 125 is greater than my outside offer of 66, accepting the offer is better than walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 88 x 4 + 33 x 0 + 80 x 2 + 89 x 1\n    which is 601 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 603. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 603\n*   My values for items: item 1 = 88, item 2 = 88, item 3 = 33, item 4 = 80, item 5 = 89\n*   Total pool of items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 4, item 3 = 0, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 1\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]. This means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 88) + (2 * 88) + (0 * 33) + (1 * 80) + (0 * 89) = 88 + 176 + 0 + 80 + 0 = 344\n    *   This is much lower than my outside offer of 603.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's consider a scenario where I offer the other player a small portion of the items while securing a value exceeding 603.  I currently have: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5.\n\n    *Let's calculate the value if I were to give away [0,0,0,0,0].  That would mean I keep [4,4,0,3,1] for a total value of 4*88+4*88+0+3*80+1*89 = 352+320+89 = 761.\n\n    *What about I offer away [1,1,0,0,0] for me to keep [3,3,0,3,1]?  3*88 + 3*88 + 0 + 3*80 + 1*89 = 264 + 264 + 240 + 89 = 857\n    \n    *How about I offer away [0,0,0,1,0]? Then I keep [4,4,0,2,1]. This yields 4*88+4*88+0+2*80+1*89 = 352+352+160+89 = 953\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer. Accepting is Mistake #4.\n*   Walking away now guarantees me 603.\n*   I can make a counteroffer that significantly exceeds my outside offer. Let's start with offering small portions of the items to Player 1.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a bit more than the initial offer, but still allows me to retain a significant portion of the items. Let's offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This would leave me with [3, 3, 0, 2, 1]. The value to me is 3*88 + 3*88 + 0 + 2*80 + 1*89 = 264 + 264 + 160 + 89 = 777.  This is significantly greater than my outside offer of 603.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

This is greater than 603.\n*   **Counteroffer 2: Keep all the items I value highly:** Keep all of item 1, item 2 and item 5. Offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n    My value = (4 * 88) + (4 * 88) + (0 * 33) + (0 * 80) + (1 * 89) = 352 + 352 + 89 = 793. This is greater than 603.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is worth 168 to me, which is far less than my outside offer of 603. So I should not accept.\n   - I should not walk away yet, as I can make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n   - Counteroffer 1 and 2 is better than my outside option.\n\nI will choose Counteroffer 1, since it give the other player more.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 1 + 90 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 98 x 0 + 93 x 1\n    which is 174 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 176. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

It would be unwise to walk away as that would violate mistake 5 (walking away from an offer better than the outside offer).\n\nThe rational action is to **ACCEPT** the current offer, as it provides a significantly higher value compared to the outside offer, and there's also the risk of rejection or an unfavorable outcome in the next round weighing down on decision-making due to the discount factor.\n\nHence, my decision:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 185. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 525 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 1 + 100 x 1 + 13 x 2 + 8 x 3 + 23 x 0\n    which is 181 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 185. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, given it's only the second round, discounting doesn't heavily impact decisions.\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n   - The current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which yields me zero value, making it worse than my outside offer of 185.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I want to design an offer that provides me a value exceeding 185. Let's consider various counteroffers.\n\n   A reasonable division might allow me to attain a value above 185. For example:\n   - Trying to keep most valuable items; aim to retain items with the highest value per unit.\n   - Let's try keeping 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3 (to increase value but allowing flexibility), and 3 units of item 4.\n\n   Calculating my value for keeping [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] (and offering [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]):\n   - Item 1: 1 x 31 = 31\n   - Item 2: 1 x 100 = 100\n   - Item 3: 0 x 13 = 0\n   - Item 4: 1 x 8 = 8\n   - Total value = 31 + 100 + 0 + 8 = 139, which is still below 185. \n\n   Adjust further to enhance that value while keeping reasonable control over powerful items.\n\n   Let's re-evaluate:\n   - Keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, and fully distribute item 4:\n     - Value for me with [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] is:\n     - Item 1: 1 x 31 = 31\n     - Item 2: 1 x 100 = 100\n     - Item 3: 1 x 13 = 13\n     - Total value = 31 + 100 + 13 = 144, still not above the outside offer.\n\n   Let's try again:\n   - Keep 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, and 3 units of item 4:\n   - Assessment with [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]:\n   - Item 1: 1 x 31 = 31\n   - Item 2: 2 x 100 = 200\n   - Item 4: 1 x 8 = 8\n   - Total value = 31 + 200 + 8 = 239.

This means that an agreement in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 of the value in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [1, 0, 0, 3, 0] (offered *to* me). This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for the current offer: (1 * 90) + (0 * 61) + (0 * 79) + (3 * 35) + (0 * 2) = 90 + 0 + 0 + 105 + 0 = 195.\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** 195 < 357. Accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider some counteroffers. I need to keep enough items to get a value greater than 357.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1: Keeping all items:**  If I keep all the items for myself, my value is (1 * 90) + (2 * 61) + (2 * 79) + (4 * 35) + (0 * 2) = 90 + 122 + 158 + 140 + 0 = 510. This is clearly the best possible value.\n*   **Counteroffer 2: Giving away some items, keeping others:** Let's try to find a counteroffer where I give away a minimum number of items while still ensuring my total value remains above 357. Since Player 1's previous offers suggest they value item 1 and item 4 highly, perhaps giving them one of each might work.\n* If I give away item 1 and 1 of item 4 I get (0 * 90) + (2 * 61) + (2 * 79) + (3 * 35) + (0 * 2) = 0 + 122 + 158 + 105 + 0 = 385.\n* Therefore, to do this I would offer the quantities [1, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. Offering [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] in the first round was an error, since player 1 has lowered their offer. The current offer is not acceptable, therefore I will try the minimal counteroffer of giving away item 1 and 1 unit of item 4.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Counteroffers are not viable as I cannot guarantee a value greater than 185 in the final round under these terms, and walking away with the outside offer provides certainty without any risks.\n\nThus, based on this analysis, the most rational action is to take my outside offer. \n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 1, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 1 + 31 x 3 + 68 x 1 + 79 x 2 + 80 x 6\n    which is 821 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 826. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To assess the current situation and potential actions, let's break down the information given:\n\n1) **Current Analysis:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** 826\n   - **Values of Items to Me:**\n     - Item 1: 22\n     - Item 2: 31\n     - Item 3: 68\n     - Item 4: 79\n     - Item 5: 80\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** If I wait until the next round, any offer I consider will be discounted by 0.9, meaning the value to me would actually be reduced.\n\n2) **Assess Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table, as this is the first move.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to keep enough value to exceed my outside offer of 826.\n\nTo find a beneficial counteroffer, I'll calculate the total value I could receive with different divisions of items:\n\nLet's consider offering some items to Player 2:\n\n- Offering [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2:\n  - My remaining items would be [1, 3, 1, 2, 6].\n  - Calculating the value to me:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n    - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 80 = 480\n    - Total value = 821\n\n821 is less than my outside offer of 826. Therefore, this division is not valuable enough.\n\nLet's adjust the offer to the other player:\n\n- Offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2:\n  - My items would be [2, 2, 1, 2, 6].\n  - Calculating the value to me:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n    - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 80 = 480\n    - Total value = 812\n\n812 is still less than 826. I need to find another combination that exceeds my outside offer.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n- Offering [1, 2, 0, 1, 3] to Player 2:\n  - My items would be [1, 1, 1, 1, 3].\n  - Calculating the value to me:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 22\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 31\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 68\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 79\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 240\n    - Total value = 440\n\n440 is still less than 826, so this is not viable.\n\nFinally, let's try another division:\n\n- Offering [0, 0, 0, 1, 2] to Player 2:\n  - My items would be [2, 3, 1, 1, 4].\n  - Calculating the value to me:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 44\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 93\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 68\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 79\n    - 4 units of item 5 = 320\n    - Total value = 604\n\n604 is not above the outside offer, so still not viable.\n\nConsidering the complexities here, if none of my attempts surpasses 826, and given the calculations, the best immediate step would be to Walk or attempt another approach. But considering only efficient calculations:\n\n**Decision:**\nBecause I cannot calculate quickly an offer more valuable than the outside offer of 826 here, and seeing the significant boost needed, the closest solution would be to initially take the 0 offer to avoid providing everything unnecessary.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 1, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 3 + 90 x 4 + 99 x 1 + 55 x 1 + 48 x 5\n    which is 1030 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1031. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Total pool of items to be divided:\n   - 4 units of item 1\n   - 4 units of item 2\n   - 4 units of item 3\n   - 3 units of item 4\n   - 5 units of item 5 \n\n4. The discount factor will come into play in future rounds, but in this round, its effect is not considered yet. However, I must keep it in mind as it will reduce the value of future accepted offers.\n\nNext, I'll assess the value of potential offers. Since there's no current offer on the table, I need to propose an initial offer. The goal is to keep item values that meet or exceed my outside offer (1031).\n\nPossible counteroffer scenarios:\n- If I offer 1 unit of each item to the other player:\n  - I keep 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n  - I keep 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n  - I keep 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n  - I keep 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n  - I keep 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n  - Total value to me = 1145\n\nThis offer, where I keep [3, 3, 3, 2, 4] items and offer the rest, results in a total value of 1145, which is greater than my outside offer of 1031.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will propose an offer that maximizes my value while ensuring it is better than my outside offer, to prevent walking away with less than optimal value.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 1, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 3 + 90 x 4 + 99 x 1 + 55 x 1 + 48 x 5\n    which is 1030 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1031. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

In round 2, the value of any negotiated offer is not discounted unless we walk into the next round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means I get all items. My value = (4\u00d792) + (4\u00d790) + (4\u00d799) + (3\u00d755) + (5\u00d748) = 1529.\n   - My first offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], means I keep [3, 3, 3, 2, 4], my value = (3\u00d792) + (3\u00d790) + (3\u00d799) + (2\u00d755) + (4\u00d748) = 1383.\n   - Given my outside offer is 1031, any offer that yields more than 1031 is acceptable.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Should I accept the current offer?: Yes, because the current offer from Player 2 is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I get all items for a total value of 1529, which is greater than my outside offer and any reasonable counteroffer. Accepting this offer makes the most sense as it provides the highest possible value.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 5, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 1 + 13 x 4 + 51 x 5 + 69 x 4 + 62 x 3\n    which is 857 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 858. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 3, 2, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 2, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1132. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 843 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 8, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 2 + 54 x 1 + 85 x 8 + 43 x 5 + 16 x 1\n    which is 1131 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1132. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the next course of action, let's walk through the situation:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 1132.\n- **Values of Items to Me:**\n  - Item 1: 83\n  - Item 2: 54\n  - Item 3: 85\n  - Item 4: 43\n  - Item 5: 16\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 5 units of Item 1\n  - 1 unit of Item 2\n  - 8 units of Item 3\n  - 5 units of Item 4\n  - 5 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** We are in round 2, and the discount factor is 0.9. If the negotiation ends in this round, the total value to me is not discounted. However, if it goes to round 3, the value of any deal will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer to Me:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  - Value = 0 (since I'm receiving nothing).\n  \n- **Previously Rejected Offer by Me:** [0, 0, 1, 1, 4]\n  - Value if kept: \\(83 \\times 5 + 54 \\times 1 + 85 \\times 7 + 43 \\times 4 + 16 \\times 1 = 987\\)\n  - This value is inferior to my outside offer of 1132, which is why it was logical to reject it earlier.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer:**\n  Let's try a proposed division that might maximize my value substantially above 1132:\n  - Consider offering 0 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n  - Calculation of my retained value:\n    - Item 1: \\(83 \\times 5 = 415\\)\n    - Item 2: \\(54 \\times 1 = 54\\)\n    - Item 3: \\(85 \\times 7 = 595\\)\n    - Item 4: \\(43 \\times 5 = 215\\)\n    - Item 5: \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\)\n  - Total = 1311\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\nGiven my offer yields a value (1311) greater than my outside offer (1132) and keeps the negotiation open to the final round, it is reasonable to propose this counteroffer to maximize the possibility of a better outcome.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 946.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 17, item 2 = 96, item 3 = 17, item 4 = 89, item 5 = 52.\n*   Total items: 5 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 8 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means accepting an offer in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value, relative to accepting it in round 1.  Similarly, accepting in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, relative to round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 0, 3]. This means I would receive 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. The value of this offer to me is: (0 * 17) + (0 * 96) + (1 * 17) + (0 * 89) + (3 * 52) = 0 + 0 + 17 + 0 + 156 = 173. Considering the round 2 discount, this offer is worth 173 * 0.9 = 155.7.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 155.7 is significantly less than my outside offer of 946. Accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 946. Let's start by considering keeping all the items for myself. This would give me: (5 * 17) + (1 * 96) + (8 * 17) + (5 * 89) + (5 * 52) = 85 + 96 + 136 + 445 + 260 = 1022.\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 only 1 unit of item 1. I would then keep [4, 1, 8, 5, 5] items. The value of this is (4 * 17) + (1 * 96) + (8 * 17) + (5 * 89) + (5 * 52) = 68 + 96 + 136 + 445 + 260 = 1005.\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 2 units of item 1. I would then keep [3, 1, 8, 5, 5] items. The value of this is (3 * 17) + (1 * 96) + (8 * 17) + (5 * 89) + (5 * 52) = 51 + 96 + 136 + 445 + 260 = 988.\n\n    Let's consider offering Player 1 [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I would keep [3, 1, 8, 5, 5]. My value would be (3*17) + (1*96) + (8*17) + (5*89) + (5*52) = 51 + 96 + 136 + 445 + 260 = 988.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I need to make a counteroffer that secures me a value greater than my outside offer of 946. I will offer player 1 two units of item 1. This leaves me with a value of 988, which, after the discount of 0.9, is equal to 889.2.\nTo improve this, I will offer player 1 one unit of item 1 and one unit of item 5. This leaves me with a value of 1005 - 52 = 953, which after the discount is 857.7. This is not an improvement.\n\nI'll try something else entirely. I will give player 1 all the item 1, all item 3, one item 4 and one item 5. Which means offering [5, 0, 8, 1, 1]. This means I keep [0, 1, 0, 4, 4]. This is worth 96+ 4*89 + 4*52 = 96 + 356 + 208 = 660.\n\nI'm still very far from reaching my desired outcome. Given the single turn left, I suspect it is necessary to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
