So the current value of the offer is indeed 376.\n\n**Analyzing My Options**\n\n1.  **ACCEPT:** I get a value of 376.\n2.  **WALK:** I get a value of 390.\n3.  **COUNTEROFFER:** This is riskier, as it could lead to a WALK in later rounds if we don't agree. However, it might get me a better deal than either ACCEPT or WALK.\n\n**Decision**\n\nThe current offer (376) is less than my outside offer (390). I should not accept this offer, as I would be better off walking away.\n\nSince the current offer is insufficient, I will respond with a counteroffer. My strategy here is to make a slightly more favorable offer to myself, while still leaving Player 1 with something of value. I'll try to get closer to my outside offer while also considering that I want a deal rather than a walk. I will try to get most of item 3, as I value it highly, and give Player 1 some of item 2.\n\nHere's my proposed counteroffer (what I offer Player 1):\n\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 4\n*   Item 3: 0\n*   Item 4: 0\n*   Item 5: 0\n\nThis leaves me with:\n* Item 1: 2\n* Item 2: 3\n* Item 3: 5\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 1\n\nMy value: 2 * 22 + 3 * 58 + 5 * 90 + 1 * 8 + 1 * 56 = 44 + 174 + 450 + 8 + 56 = 732\n\n**Reasoning:** I'm aiming for a deal that surpasses my outside offer of 390.

Therefore, I should only accept if I can't get a better deal by making a counteroffer. Let's figure out what a good counteroffer would look like.\n\nI need to offer Player 1 something that they value enough to accept, but still leaves me with more than 390 (discounted).

I offered Player 1 [1,4,0,0,0].\nMy current offer from Player 1 is [2,3,0,0,0].\n\nLet x = [x1,x2,x3,x4,x5] be my counteroffer. I will receive 3-x1 of item 1, 7-x2 of item 2, 5-x3 of item 3, 1-x4 of item 4 and 1-x5 of item 5. The total value of this is\nV = (3-x1)*22 + (7-x2)*58 + (5-x3)*90 + (1-x4)*8 + (1-x5)*56 =\n66-22*x1 + 406 - 58*x2 + 450 - 90*x3 + 8 - 8*x4 + 56 - 56*x5\n\nV = 986 - (22*x1 + 58*x2 + 90*x3 + 8*x4 + 56*x5).\nI want to maximize V*0.9. I need V*0.9 > 390, so V > 390/0.9 = 433.33. So I want to make 986 - (22*x1 + 58*x2 + 90*x3 + 8*x4 + 56*x5) > 433.33.\n\nThis means I need to offer Player 1 less than 986 - 433.33 = 552.67 worth of items.\nLet's start by giving Player 1 most of item 3, as I value it the highest. How about [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]?\nMy new value would be (3*22) + (7*58) + (1*90) + (1*8) + (1*56) = 66 + 406 + 90 + 8 + 56 = 626\nDiscounted to 626*0.9 = 563.4 which is more than my outside offer.\n\nSo offer [0, 0, 4, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's break down this negotiation.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n*   **My Values:** I value item 1 at 20, item 2 at 10, item 3 at 29, item 4 at 88, and item 5 at 30 per unit.\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 3 and all 7 units of item 4.\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 782.\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value from the negotiation.\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer**\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n\n*   1 unit of item 3, worth 1 * 29 = 29\n*   7 units of item 4, worth 7 * 88 = 616\n*   Total value of the offer: 29 + 616 = 645\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So the present value of this offer is 645.\n\n**Considering My Options**\n\n1.  **ACCEPT:** Receive a value of 645.\n2.  **WALK:** Receive my outside offer of 782.\n3.  **COUNTEROFFER:** Try to get a better deal, but risk rejection and a lower payoff in later rounds due to the discount factor.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nThe current offer (645) is significantly less than my outside offer (782). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a bad move.\n\nI need to decide if I should walk away or make a counteroffer.\nIf I make a counteroffer, I'll try to get as much as possible, but there is no guarantee that Player 1 will accept. If Player 1 rejects my counteroffer, and I accept in round 2, my discounted value is multiplied by 0.9. If I accept in round 3, it is multiplied by 0.9^2=0.81. If I walk in round 2 or 3, I get my outside option of 782 multiplied by 0.9 or 0.81, respectively.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that would be acceptable to me if I accept it immediately (in round 2). Assume that I will accept this offer (if Player 1 makes it) in round 2. If I walk in round 2, I get 782*0.9=703.8. Thus I need at least 703.8/0.9 = 782 worth from Player 1's offer. \n\nI have 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\nMy values are 20, 10, 29, 88, 30.\nPlayer 1 has values for item 1 through item 5 of v1, v2, v3, v4, v5.\n\n**Making a Counteroffer**\n\nI want to make a counteroffer that significantly improves my position. A reasonable target is something close to my outside option, 782. However, if the amount I give to Player 1 is too low, they may reject my offer.\n\nI know that Player 1 is likely to value item 4 a lot since they offered me all 7 units. Therefore, giving them some of the items that I value more could encourage them to give me some items that they value more.\n\nLet's calculate the value of all the items:\nItem 1: 3 * 20 = 60\nItem 2: 2 * 10 = 20\nItem 3: 3 * 29 = 87\nItem 4: 7 * 88 = 616\nItem 5: 4 * 30 = 120\nTotal: 903\n\nI will offer [0,0,0,0,0]. I am asking for everything. This guarantees that my outcome will be better than my outside offer.\nThe values being offered to me are 3*v1+2*v2+3*v3+7*v4+4*v5.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

My previous offer included the entire set of an item (7 of item 4), and Player 2 rejected it, suggesting item 4 may have significant value to them.\n\nGiven the discount factor and the fact that Player 2's counteroffer is effectively a rejection of any division, my best strategy is:\n\n- Accept the current offer because the adjusted value (686.7) is less than my outside offer but the chance of Player 2 accepting any counteroffer in the final round seems slim based on their previous action.

The discounted value of the current offer (283.5) is significantly less than my outside offer. Therefore, I shouldn't accept it.\n\n**Formulating a Counteroffer**\n\nI need to decide if making a counteroffer is better than walking away. If I walk away, I get 782. If I make a counteroffer in this round, and Player 1 accepts, my value will be multiplied by 0.9. If Player 1 rejects or I don't make an offer in Round 3, I walk away with my outside offer.\n\nLet's see what a good counteroffer would look like. I want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 just enough to be better off accepting than walking. I need to consider Player 1's potential values to determine what this acceptable offer is. Since I don't know Player 1's values or outside offer, and this is only round 2, I will create an offer that is relatively fair, but still leans heavily in my favor, hoping to get Player 1 to accept in round 3. Let's give them most of Item 4, a small amount of Item 5, and nothing else.\n\nI will offer Player 1 the following:\n\n*   Item 1: 0\n*   Item 2: 0\n*   Item 3: 0\n*   Item 4: 6\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nThis leaves me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 3\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 3\n*   Item 4: 1\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nMy Value with This Outcome = (3 * 20) + (2 * 10) + (3 * 29) + (1 * 88) + (2 * 30) = 60 + 20 + 87 + 88 + 60 = 315\nDiscounted Value = 315 * 0.9 = 283.5.\nThis discounted value is still much lower than my outside offer (782).\n\nI need to make an offer that would actually allow me to surpass my outside offer. In Round 3, the discounted value will be only multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\nI need to get at least a value of 782 / 0.81 = 965.43 in the final outcome to be beneficial. This is unlikely, considering my total value of all items is only 903.\n\nSince I am not confident I can reach an agreement that exceeds my outside offer in a timely manner, the best action would be to walk away now.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I want to keep the items with the highest personal value to ensure the highest offer for me:\n\n- Prioritize keeping more of item 5 (value 83), item 2 (value 42), and item 3 (value 41).\n- I am willing to offer more of item 1 and item 4, as they have lower values.\n\nThe strategy is to offer units that result in a lower total value for me than my outside offer adjusted by the discount rate. We also need to leave enough value for Player 2 to accept the deal based on their unknown outside offer and values.\n\nConsidering these factors, a reasonable start might be:\n\n- Offer something reasonable enough as a starting point: [4, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCalculations:\n\nItems remaining for me with this offer:\n- Item 1: 5 units * 8 = 40 value\n- Item 2: 4 units * 42 = 168 value\n- Item 3: 3 units * 41 = 123 value\n- Item 4: 2 units * 32 = 64 value\n- Item 5: 4 units * 83 = 332 value\n\nTotal for me with this allocation: 727\n\nThis value (727) is slightly less than my outside offer but gives room for negotiation. Moreover, in future rounds, the present value decreases due to the discount rate, adding leverage to this offer.\n\nI believe this offer provides a balanced starting point and room for negotiation for both parties.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 2, and Player 1 has offered me [4, 1, 1, 0, 1] in the first round. My private values are [1, 61, 20, 49, 92] for items 1 to 5, respectively, and my outside offer is 282. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(4 * 1) + (1 * 61) + (1 * 20) + (0 * 49) + (1 * 92) = 4 + 61 + 20 + 0 + 92 = 177\n\nSince this is round 1, if I accept, the discounted value is 177 * (0.9)^(1-1) = 177 * 1 = 177.\nThis is less than my outside offer of 282, so accepting now is worse than walking away *if* I expect to get my outside offer.\n\nHowever, I should also consider making a counteroffer. If I walk away now, I get 282. If Player 1 walks away in a later round, they get their outside offer, which I don't know, but assume is similar in magnitude. If I make a counteroffer, I'll get a chance for a better deal but this will be discounted by 0.9 in round 2 and (0.9)^2 in round 3.\n\nLet's see how Player 1 valued their offer. They gave away: 4 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 0 item 4 and 1 item 5.\nThe total items are: 9 item 1, 5 item 2, 4 item 3, 2 item 4, 5 item 5.\nSo after the offer, they have: 5 item 1, 4 item 2, 3 item 3, 2 item 4, 4 item 5.\n\nSince I don't know Player 1's values, it's hard to guess what they would accept. I can attempt a more aggressive counteroffer, giving them only slightly more than their current offer *to me*. Their offer to me has a value of 177 to me.\nIf I were to give them [5, 4, 3, 2, 4], then I will receive [4, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nOkay, let's calculate my value for giving Player 1 [5, 4, 3, 2, 4].  Their value is unknown, but let's see how much I would get.\nItems remaining for me = [4, 1, 1, 0, 1].  The value of this to me is 177, as calculated before.\n\nThe total value of all the items to me is:\n(9 * 1) + (5 * 61) + (4 * 20) + (2 * 49) + (5 * 92) = 9 + 305 + 80 + 98 + 460 = 952\nMy outside offer is 282.\n\nNow, let's think about what a good counteroffer would be. I want to get at least 282 discounted back to round 1, so about 348.\nSince accepting gives me 177, I need to counteroffer.\n\nI should make a counteroffer that is better than 177, but also better than walking away to 282. So perhaps I should try to get 400 in value from the final deal. \nI need to offer Player 1 something they would want to accept.\nI'll try giving player 1 [5, 1, 1, 0, 1]. My value would be:\n(4 * 1) + (4 * 61) + (3 * 20) + (2 * 49) + (4 * 92) = 4 + 244 + 60 + 98 + 368 = 774\nMy remaining items would be [4, 4, 3, 2, 4] which has a value of 774.\nSo this is a good plan!\n\nIf I offer [5, 1, 1, 0, 1] to them, then I receive [4, 4, 3, 2, 4], which has a value of 774.\n\nLet's go with that.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

So the present value of accepting the offer is 176 * 0.9 = 158.4.\n\n**Assessing the Walk Away Option**\n\nIf Player 2 walks away, they receive their outside offer, which is 282. This is discounted by 0.9 to the power of 0 = 1, so their value is 282.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer**\n\nTo determine if a counteroffer is beneficial, we need to consider the following:\n\n*   **Player 1's Perspective:** We don't know Player 1's exact values. We can try to infer some information from their offers.\n*   **Feasibility:** We need to construct a counteroffer that Player 1 is likely to accept in round 3.\n*   **Potential Gain:**  The counteroffer needs to improve Player 2's outcome significantly enough to justify the risk of Player 1 walking away.\n\nLet's calculate the total amount of each item:\nItem 1: 9\nItem 2: 5\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 5\n\nThe current offer to Player 2 is [3, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means Player 1 has [6, 4, 3, 2, 4]. Player 1's offers have been relatively stable: [4, 1, 1, 0, 1], [5, 1, 1, 0, 1], and now [3, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This shows that Player 1 wants a lot of item 1 and items 2, 3, and 5 are valuable to Player 2.\n\nThe outside offer for Player 2 is quite high. We want to get as close to 282 as possible.\n\nLet's consider an offer where Player 2 gets [2, 1, 0, 0, 2]:\n(2 * 1) + (1 * 61) + (0 * 20) + (0 * 49) + (2 * 92) = 2 + 61 + 0 + 0 + 184 = 247.\nDiscounted, this is 247 * 0.9 = 222.3\n\nLet's try an offer where Player 2 gets [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]:\n(1 * 1) + (2 * 61) + (0 * 20) + (0 * 49) + (2 * 92) = 1 + 122 + 0 + 0 + 184 = 307\nDiscounted, this is 307 * 0.9 = 276.3\n\nThis seems promising. Player 1 would get [8, 3, 4, 2, 3]. Let's check if that would be better than walking away, without knowing Player 1's values.\n\n**Decision**\n\nSince the value of the current offer (158.4) is significantly less than Player 2's outside offer (282), we should attempt to improve the offer. A counteroffer that gives the player a discounted value near their outside offer would be the best outcome if Player 1 accepts, and if not, the player can still walk away with their outside offer.\n\nBased on the analysis above, offering Player 1 the offer [8, 3, 4, 2, 3] seems reasonable. This equates to offering me [1, 2, 0, 0, 2].\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [8, 3, 4, 2, 3]}\n```",

So, the present value of accepting the current offer is 413 * 1 = 413.\n\n**Considerations for making a counteroffer:**\nMy total value for all items is 1069. If I reject this and player 1 rejects my counter offer. Next round (round 2) the discount rate applies and I would get 0.9 * value.\nAlso need to consider I could get my outside offer of 737 if negotiations fail. So the value of getting my outside offer * the discount needs to be considered.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe value of accepting the current offer (413) is significantly less than my outside offer (737). Therefore, I will attempt to get closer to my outside offer by making a counteroffer. I will aim for an offer that gives me at least 737/0.9 = 819 worth. This will ensure that I don't get a worse deal than if negotiations failed and it went to the next round.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer that achieves a balance between giving Player 1 enough to accept and getting enough value for myself. I will start by offering player 1 just a bit less than half of the items as follows.\n\nMy total items available are 6, 3, 4, 4, 7 for items 1-5\nSo I offer them 2, 1, 1, 1, 2\n\nMy value for 4, 2, 3, 3, 5 = 4 * 88 + 2 * 15 + 3 * 92 + 3 * 18 + 5 * 8 = 352 + 30 + 276 + 54 + 40 = 752.\nThis still seems a bit low, I want to get > 737/0.9.\n\nMy value for 3, 2, 3, 3, 4 = 3 * 88 + 1 * 15 + 1 * 92 + 1 * 18 + 3 * 8 = 264 + 30 + 276 + 54 + 32 = 656. This is too low\n\nTherefore I shall ACCEPT the offer, as I may get an even worse offer next round, due to the discounting.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Therefore, accepting is not a good option. Walking is a possible option. Now let's think about a reasonable counteroffer and whether it is worthwhile.\n\nGiven the fact that I'm currently receiving an offer worth 104, which is substantially less than my outside offer of 291, I should attempt to negotiate.\n\nI want to maximize the value I get from Item 3 and Item 5. I don't value items 1 and 2 highly, so giving those to Player 1 isn't a big loss. And, I don't value item 4 too much either.\n\nI currently get 1 unit of item 3, which is great, but no units of item 5. Player 1 is getting 1 unit of item 3 and 2 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5 currently.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It is round 2. I am Player 2. The current offer on the table is [0, 2, 1, 0, 0], meaning Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My private values are 6 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 70 for item 3, 18 for item 4, and 47 for item 5. My outside offer is 291. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(0 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (1 * 70) + (0 * 18) + (0 * 47) = 0 + 8 + 70 + 0 + 0 = 78\n\nSince it's round 2, if I accept this offer, my value will be 78 * 0.9^(2-1) = 78 * 0.9 = 70.2. This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 291.\n\nNow let's think about a potential counteroffer. Since it is round 2, I should probably propose an offer that is reasonably likely to be accepted in round 3 (if it gets there), otherwise, I will walk away with my outside option in round 3.\n\nTo determine a good counteroffer, I need to estimate Player 1's values. I don't know their values, but I do know that they initially offered me [3, 4, 1, 0, 0] in round 1, then [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] in round 2. This indicates that their value for item 1, item 2, and item 3 might be comparatively low, whilst my value for item 3 is high.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep most of item 3 and give them most of the other items.\nWhat if I offer Player 1 [3, 6, 1, 2, 2]? This means I would receive [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\nMy value for this would be (0 * 6) + (0 * 4) + (1 * 70) + (0 * 18) + (0 * 47) = 70.  Discounted by 0.9, this is 63. This is worse than accepting the current offer.\n\nI need to do better. I should make a counteroffer that gives me a value closer to my outside option. Let's aim for a value that, when discounted, is slightly higher than my outside option.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of item units: 3 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15\nMy total value is 312. My average item value is 312/15 = 20.8. My outside option is 291, which means that the amount I need to gain in the last round is 291/0.9 = 323.33. This means my offer needs to have a value of at least 323.33.\n\nLet's make an offer of [3, 6, 0, 0, 0]. In this case, I would keep [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]. The value of my allocation is (0 * 6) + (0 * 4) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 18) + (2 * 47) = 0 + 0 + 140 + 36 + 94 = 270. Discounted by 0.9, this is 243. This is still too low.\n\nLet's try again, this time aiming for a value of about 323. My values for item 3, item 4, and item 5 are pretty high. I need to get as much as possible of those to make the counteroffer worthwhile.\n\nHow about offering Player 1 [3, 6, 0, 2, 0]? This gives me [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]. My value is (0 * 6) + (0 * 4) + (2 * 70) + (0 * 18) + (2 * 47) = 140 + 0 + 94 = 234. Discounted this is 210.6, this is lower than the walkaway.\n\nI will aim for a final counteroffer. If this offer is not accepted, I will walk away.\n\nLet's consider an offer that gives me almost everything I want. Offer player 1 [3, 6, 0, 0, 0]. I get [0, 0, 2, 2, 2] which is worth (0 * 6) + (0 * 4) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 18) + (2 * 47) = 0 + 0 + 140 + 36 + 94 = 270. This means that if I accept, I get 270 * 0.9 = 243, which is too low.\n\nGiven the current offer is so bad and that I only have one round left, I will walk away.\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's break down this negotiation.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n*   **My Values:** I value item 1 at 85, item 2 at 76, item 3 at 26, item 4 at 25, and item 5 at 12.\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n*   **My Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 604.\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value from the negotiation.\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer**\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n\n*   2 * 26 (item 3) = 52\n*   4 * 25 (item 4) = 100\n*   1 * 12 (item 5) = 12\n*   Total Value = 52 + 100 + 12 = 164\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So, the present value of accepting the current offer is 164.\n\n**Considering My Options**\n\n1.  **ACCEPT:** Receive a value of 164.\n2.  **WALK:** Receive a value of 604.\n3.  **COUNTEROFFER:** Attempt to get a better deal, but risk a walk in later rounds or a less favorable offer.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nSince my outside offer is 604 and the current offer is worth only 164, walking away would be the best immediate choice. However, there are three rounds of negotiation. A counteroffer could potentially lead to a deal better than both the current offer (164) and my walkaway (604).\n\nThe total number of items are 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\nMy valuation of all the items is (3 * 85) + (1 * 76) + (5 * 26) + (6 * 25) + (2 * 12) = 255 + 76 + 130 + 150 + 24 = 635.\nPlayer 1 has offered me a very small proportion of items, leading to a value of only 164.\n\nSince this is round 1, there is a chance that a more reasonable counteroffer will be accepted by Player 1 in round 2 or 3. I should only walk away if the current offer is less than my outside option discounted by gamma^2.\nMy outside option discounted by gamma^2 = 604 * 0.9^2 = 489.24.\nThe current offer value is 164, so I should consider making a counteroffer.\n\nLet's calculate the values of the items to player 1:\nitem 1: 3 * v1\nitem 2: 1 * v2\nitem 3: 5 * v3\nitem 4: 6 * v4\nitem 5: 2 * v5\n\nTo make this worthwhile for both players, I want to maximize the value for me while still leaving a reasonable amount for Player 1.\nMy outside offer is 604.\nSince I have 635 value of all items, I can potentially offer Player 1 enough that I get at least close to 604 in expected value, accounting for the discount factor. Let's try to get to around 400 for my value after this round, so that the value is worth 360 with one round of discounting.\n\nConsider offering Player 1 2 items of type 3, and 2 items of type 4, and 1 item of type 5. Then I will get:\n3 items of type 1 = 3 * 85 = 255\n1 items of type 2 = 1 * 76 = 76\n3 items of type 3 = 3 * 26 = 78\n2 items of type 4 = 2 * 25 = 50\n1 items of type 5 = 1 * 12 = 12\ntotal = 255 + 76 + 78 + 50 + 12 = 471\n\n**Counteroffer**\n\nI will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 the following:\n\n*   Item 1: 3\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 3\n*   Item 4: 2\n*   Item 5: 1\nThis leaves me with 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 1 of item 5 (the current offer).\n\nThis leaves me with a value of 471.\nThe alternative is the walk away value of 604.\n\nOkay, so after some more thinking and calculation I will offer the following deal to Player 1 to maximize my expected value of the negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 3, 2, 1]}\n",

The current offer on the table from Player 1 is [1, 4, 0, 1, 3], meaning they are offering me 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 52\n- Item 2: 88\n- Item 3: 64\n- Item 4: 26\n- Item 5: 99\n\nMy outside offer is 1021.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 52) + (4 * 88) + (0 * 64) + (1 * 26) + (3 * 99) = 52 + 352 + 0 + 26 + 297 = 727\n\nIf I accept this offer, my value is 727. If I walk away, my value is 1021. Therefore, walking away is better than accepting the current offer *right now*. However, this is only round 1, and I can make a counteroffer.\n\nI need to figure out what kind of counteroffer to make. To do this, I need to consider Player 1's perspective, though I don't know their exact values. Since it's Round 1, I'll aim for a split that is slightly in my favor, assuming that Player 1 will also have values that make them want more of everything. I will craft an offer that gives them a decent amount but still gives me better than my outside option, anticipating they will negotiate somewhat. I want to offer them a deal they are likely to consider. This is a negotiation, and I will assume that they are rational.\n\nThe total units of items are:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 6\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 6\n\nI'll start by offering them roughly \"half\" of the items but adjusting it based on my valuations. Let's initially offer:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 3\n\nThis means I would receive:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 3\n\nMy value for this would be:\n(2 * 52) + (3 * 88) + (0 * 64) + (2 * 26) + (3 * 99) = 104 + 264 + 0 + 52 + 297 = 717\n\nThis is still below my outside option. So I should modify the offer to increase my value. I will decrease what I give to the other player on the most valuable things to me:\n\nOffer:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 4\n\nMy value would be:\n(3 * 52) + (4 * 88) + (0 * 64) + (3 * 26) + (4 * 99) = 156 + 352 + 0 + 78 + 396 = 982\n\nStill not high enough.\n\nFinal Offer:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be:\n(3 * 52) + (4 * 88) + (0 * 64) + (3 * 26) + (5 * 99) = 156 + 352 + 0 + 78 + 495 = 1081\n\nThis exceeds my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 1 has offered me [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], meaning 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My private values are 4, 75, 74, 44, 54 for items 1 through 5 respectively. My outside offer is 56.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 4) + (0 * 75) + (1 * 74) + (0 * 44) + (0 * 54) = 4 + 0 + 74 + 0 + 0 = 78\n\nSince 78 is greater than my outside offer of 56, I should not walk away immediately.\n\nNow, let's consider whether to accept or make a counteroffer. If I accept, I get a value of 78. If I make a counteroffer, it's likely Player 1 will want a significant portion of the items, especially items 2, 3, 4, and 5, for which my values are high. There's also the discount factor to consider in future rounds (gamma = 0.9). The value of a deal in later rounds is reduced.\n\nLet's think about a counteroffer that might be acceptable to Player 1 while still giving me a good value. A reasonable strategy is to concede a bit on item 3 (of which I have a lot).\n\nHere's a possible counteroffer: I offer Player 1 [4, 1, 3, 1, 1].\nThis means I would get [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]. The value to me would be:\n(1 * 4) + (1 * 75) + (1 * 74) + (2 * 44) + (2 * 54) = 4 + 75 + 74 + 88 + 108 = 349\n\nIf I accept the current offer I get 78. I need to think of Player 1's perspective and what they might find acceptable. It's likely that Player 1 values item 3 more than item 1 (since the initial offer was 1 item 1 and 1 item 3 to me).\n\nI don't have enough information about Player 1's valuations to make a precise calculation. However, given my high valuations for items 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the discount factor, I believe my best course of action is to make a counteroffer, but I am hesitant to offer too much early on. I will offer Player 1 slightly more of item 3 in exchange for more of items 2, 4, and 5.\n\nI will offer Player 1: [4, 0, 3, 1, 1]. This gives me [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]. The value to me is:\n(1 * 4) + (2 * 75) + (1 * 74) + (2 * 44) + (2 * 54) = 4 + 150 + 74 + 88 + 108 = 424\n\nSince 424 > 78, this seems like a better option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

Thus:\n- Offer more of Item 5 (often less valued by others)\n- Keep majority of Item 3 for myself\n\n### Propose Counteroffer to Maximize Value\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 1 (keep 4 for me)\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 2 (leaving me with 1)\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 3 (for negotiation, leaving 3)\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 4 (leaving 2 for me)\n- Offer 2 units of Item 5 (leaving 1 high value unit for me)\n\nThis counteroffer allows me to potentially gain a value more than my outside offer with the items I keep.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

My private values are 4, 75, 74, 44, and 54 respectively, and my outside offer is 56. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(1 * 4) + (1 * 75) + (1 * 74) + (1 * 44) + (2 * 54) = 4 + 75 + 74 + 44 + 108 = 305\n\nSince it's round 2, the value of this offer is discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of accepting the current offer is 305 * 0.9 = 274.5\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of walking away. My outside offer is 56, which is also discounted by 0.9, so it is worth 50.4. This is significantly lower than the discounted current offer.\n\nFinally, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to decide what I want, what I think Player 1 wants, and whether a deal is even possible. It's probably not possible to figure out Player 1's private values, so I must assume they are rational.\n\nI have the following items:\nItem 1: 5 units\nItem 2: 2 units\nItem 3: 4 units\nItem 4: 3 units\nItem 5: 3 units\n\nPlayer 1 is currently offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]. This means they get:\nItem 1: 5 - 1 = 4\nItem 2: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 3: 4 - 1 = 3\nItem 4: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 5: 3 - 2 = 1\n\nIf I were to counteroffer, I would want to improve my share of the more valuable items (items 2 and 3). However, given that accepting gives me 274.5 and walking away gives me 50.4, I would likely need to ask for a significant amount more to be worth counter offering. I am also not taking into account Player 1's values.\n\nGiven this is round 2 and the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, I will accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

The discount factor is 0.9. In round 2, my value will be multiplied by 0.9 and in round 3 (if it gets there), my value will be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\nSince the current offer is already significantly better than my outside offer, I should consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to get a better deal while still ensuring that Player 1 gets at least their outside offer value. I don't know Player 1's values, so it's risky.\n\nGiven that accepting gives me 764, which is much greater than my outside offer, I will proceed by trying to get slightly more.\n\nIf I offer Player 1 half of item 1, and none of the other items, then I offer [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The current offer gave me 764, so let's consider offering Player 1 something that gets me around 800.\n\nLet's offer Player 1: [5, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nThis gives me:\nItem 1: 3 * 100 = 300\nItem 2: 2 * 86 = 172\nItem 3: 2 * 20 = 40\nItem 4: 1 * 52 = 52\nItem 5: 4 * 19 = 76\nTotal: 300 + 172 + 40 + 52 + 76 = 640.

If I walk away, I get 854. Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away *right now*.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1. I have two more rounds to negotiate. I need to consider the discount factor of 0.9. If I make a counteroffer, I risk Player 1 walking away, in which case I get my outside offer. If we reach a deal in later rounds, the value will be discounted.\n\nLet's think about what a good counteroffer would be. I want to get as close to my outside offer as possible. The total number of items are: 1 unit of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\nI value items 4 and 5 the most.\n\nMy total value for all items is (1 * 61) + (6 * 46) + (6 * 60) + (3 * 94) + (6 * 96) = 61 + 276 + 360 + 282 + 576 = 1555.\n\nI should try to get more items 4 and 5 in my offer. Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 only item 2 and item 3.\nMy counteroffer: offer Player 1 [1, 4, 4, 0, 0].\nThis leaves me with: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\nThe value of this to me is: (0 * 61) + (2 * 46) + (2 * 60) + (3 * 94) + (6 * 96) = 0 + 92 + 120 + 282 + 576 = 1070.\nIf I can get Player 1 to accept this, then even with a discount factor I will likely be better than my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider another possibility. I can try and get a bit more value now.\nLet me evaluate Player 1's offer to me: [0, 2, 2, 1, 3]. This gives Player 1: [1, 4, 4, 2, 3]\nI want to minimize the value to player 1.\n\nA good strategy is to aim for a roughly equal split of the total value. I know my total value is 1555. I don't know Player 1's total value, but if I can get at least half of my own total value, I'll be doing well.\n\nI think a reasonable counteroffer is to give them half of item 2 and item 3, and keep all of items 4 and 5 for myself. Offer: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0]. This leaves me with [1, 3, 3, 3, 6]\nMy value is: 61 + (3 * 46) + (3 * 60) + (3 * 94) + (6 * 96) = 61 + 138 + 180 + 282 + 576 = 1237\n\nThis is more than my outside option, and leaves some room to negotiate downwards if needed.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 0, 0]}\n",

This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.  This implies Player 1 is taking 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are: 57 for item 1, 59 for item 2, 50 for item 3, 63 for item 4, 29 for item 5.\nPlayer 1's offer gives me:\n*   0 * 57 = 0\n*   0 * 59 = 0\n*   3 * 50 = 150\n*   1 * 63 = 63\n*   2 * 29 = 58\nTotal value of the offer to me: 0 + 0 + 150 + 63 + 58 = 271\n\nMy outside offer is 681.\n\nIf I accept the offer, I get 271. If I walk away, I get 681. Therefore, walking away is better *right now*. However, this is only round 1. If I make a counteroffer, there is a chance I can get a better deal in rounds 2 or 3 (discounted by gamma = 0.9 each round). I need to figure out what a good counteroffer would be.\n\nThe total value of the items is:\n*   Item 1: 3 units * 57 = 171\n*   Item 2: 5 units * 59 = 295\n*   Item 3: 4 units * 50 = 200\n*   Item 4: 2 units * 63 = 126\n*   Item 5: 5 units * 29 = 145\nTotal Value = 171 + 295 + 200 + 126 + 145 = 937\n\nIf I ask for everything, Player 1 gets nothing. Given I am trying to maximize my reward, and want to aim to get something above my outside offer, I need to consider offering enough that player 1 has some incentive to accept. I need to be strategic.\n\nLet's try to target a split where I get around 75% of the total value initially, then adjust to get to my outside offer given the discount.\nThat would be about 700 for me and 237 for them\n\nLet's make an offer that gives Player 1 some of the items where my value is low and their value may be high. Since I don't know their values, I will just make a reasonable guess based on quantities available. Offer the other player 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\nThis means I keep 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 2 of item 5\n\nMy value would then be 1 * 57 + 3 * 59 + 4 * 50 + 2 * 63 + 2 * 29 = 57 + 177 + 200 + 126 + 58 = 618\n\nIf I make that offer, and Player 1 rejects and walks, I get 681. If they reject, I get the chance to counteroffer again but that is impacted by the discount factor. Let's aim to increase my current value a bit to get above the outside offer and account for a potential drop in later rounds.\n\nLet's offer them: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 2 of item 5\nThen, I would receive: 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5\nMy value would then be 2 * 57 + 4 * 59 + 4 * 50 + 2 * 63 + 3 * 29 = 114 + 236 + 200 + 126 + 87 = 763\n\nThis seems high relative to my outside offer.\n\nI'll offer 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\nThen, I would receive: 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5\nMy value would then be 2 * 57 + 3 * 59 + 4 * 50 + 2 * 63 + 2 * 29 = 114 + 177 + 200 + 126 + 58 = 675\n\nThis is really close to the outside offer.\n\nNow, I choose to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 4, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 4, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nMy values are: item 1: 16, item 2: 100, item 3: 65, item 4: 55, item 5: 63.\nPlayer 1 offered me [1, 0, 4, 2, 2].  This means Player 1 gets: item 1: 4, item 2: 1, item 3: 5, item 4: 4, item 5: 4.\n\nMy value for the offer is: (1 * 16) + (0 * 100) + (4 * 65) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 63) = 16 + 0 + 260 + 110 + 126 = 512\nPlayer 1's offer to me is worth 512.\n\nMy outside offer is 1341.\n\nIf I accept the offer, I get 512. If I walk away, I get 1341.\n\nLet's calculate Player 1's value if I accept:\nPlayer 1 gets: item 1: 4, item 2: 1, item 3: 5, item 4: 4, item 5: 4.\nWe don't know Player 1's values, but we know they must be in the range [1, 101]. If their values were all 1, their offer would be worth 4 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 18. If their values were all 101, their offer would be worth 404 + 101 + 505 + 404 + 404 = 1818. So it's a big range, and we don't know their outside option.\n\nSince this is round 1, there are two rounds of potential negotiation remaining.  This means that I should likely not accept anything that is less than my outside offer, discounted by the two remaining rounds. That is, I need to get more than 1341 * (0.9^2) = 1341 * 0.81 = 1086.21 in order for it to be worth accepting immediately.\n\nSo, 512 is way less than 1086.21. I should counteroffer.\n\nI want to get as much as possible. I value item 2 the highest at 100. Item 3 is 65, Item 5 is 63, Item 4 is 55, and Item 1 is only 16. I need to consider Player 1's perspective too, but I don't know what their values are.\n\nA reasonable strategy is to offer Player 1 something that is slightly better than their walkaway point. Since I don't know their walkaway, I'm going to aim for something that gives me at least 1086.21 right now.\n\nI need to get 1086.21 immediately. Let's try offering them items that I don't value highly. Let's try offering them all of item 1. That costs me 5 * 16 = 80. Let's offer them 5 of item 3. That costs me 5 * 65 = 325.\nLet's offer them 3 of item 4. That costs me 3 * 55 = 165. Let's offer them 3 of item 5. That costs me 3 * 63 = 189.\nSo, I would offer [5, 0, 5, 3, 3].\nMy value would then be: (0 * 16) + (1 * 100) + (4 * 65) + (3 * 55) + (3 * 63) = 0 + 100 + 260 + 165 + 189 = 714. This isn't enough.\n\nI need to aim higher. To get 1086.21 right now, I can offer less to Player 1.\n\nI need to offer Player 1 enough to make them think twice about walking away.\n\nLet me try offering [4, 0, 6, 4, 4] to player 1. This leaves me with [1, 1, 3, 2, 2].\nMy value is then: (1 * 16) + (1 * 100) + (3 * 65) + (2 * 55) + (2 * 63) = 16 + 100 + 195 + 110 + 126 = 547. That's not enough.\n\nLet's try offering [4, 0, 7, 5, 5]. This leaves me with [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]. My value is then (1 * 16) + (1 * 100) + (2 * 65) + (1 * 55) + (1 * 63) = 16 + 100 + 130 + 55 + 63 = 364. That's much too low.\n\nI'll try a different approach. Since I can only make counteroffers for 2 more rounds, I'm going to make an offer that gives me close to my outside option, and hope Player 1 accepts.\nI need to offer as little as possible to player 1 while maximizing my gains. Let's try offering player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything. My value = 1473.\nLet's try offering player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That gives me a value of 1473 - 16 = 1457.\nLet's try offering player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. That gives me a value of 1473 - 100 = 1373. This is promising!\nLet's offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If I walk, I get 660.\n\nI need to consider making a counteroffer. The total number of items is 5+3+2+4+4 = 18. The current offer gives me 3+1+0+2+1 = 7 items. So Player 1 gets 18 - 7 = 11 items.\n\nTo decide on a good counteroffer, I need to consider the discount factor in the later rounds. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I get close to my outside offer. Let's try to target a value of around 700 for myself in the first round, and then see how close Player 1 could be.\n\nIf I give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], then I get [5, 3, 2, 4, 4] and my value is (5 * 84) + (3 * 58) + (2 * 48) + (4 * 28) + (4 * 8) = 420 + 174 + 96 + 112 + 32 = 834. So, giving Player 1 nothing is not a great start.\n\nSince I'm in the first round, I have more leverage than in later rounds. I want to determine a counteroffer that would give Player 1 at least what they are getting now, but would be better for me.\n\nLet's look at Player 1's offer. Their offer gave them [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]. I don't know their values but I can determine my value.\n\nInstead of giving Player 1 [2, 2, 2, 2, 3], I would give them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then my value becomes 834, so maybe I should ask for more items.\n\nSince I am trying to maximize my return here, I'll make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 very little. Let's try this counteroffer: I give Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 1, 1].\nThat means I would have [4, 3, 2, 3, 3]. My value then becomes (4 * 84) + (3 * 58) + (2 * 48) + (3 * 28) + (3 * 8) = 336 + 174 + 96 + 84 + 24 = 714.\n\nThis is greater than my current offer of 374. And I'm getting 714, which is better than accepting now.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n",

The discounted value of the current offer (183.6) is significantly less than my outside offer. Therefore, walking away would be better than accepting this offer.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer:**\n\nI need to decide if there's a counteroffer that Player 1 would accept and that would be better for me than walking away. Let's figure out what Player 1 has been offered in the past.\n\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 2, 1] to me. So, they kept [2, 2, 2, 2, 3].\nRound 1: I offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] to Player 1. So, I kept [4, 3, 2, 3, 3].\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 1] to me. So, they keep [3, 3, 2, 3, 3].\n\nSince Player 1 has a private value for each item, I can't know exactly what they value the items at.\n\n**Reasoning and Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is very unfavorable to me. My outside offer of 660 is much better. Even with the discount factor, walking away gives me more value than accepting. I could try a counteroffer, but I'd need to give up a lot of items to make it appealing to Player 1, and I don't have enough information to determine a counteroffer that would definitely be accepted while still exceeding my outside offer. Given the limited rounds, I'm better off walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's break down this negotiation and figure out the best action for Player 2 in round 1.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n*   **Items:** 5 types of items with quantities 5, 5, 4, 4, and 8 units respectively.\n*   **Values (Player 2):** 92 (item 1), 14 (item 2), 10 (item 3), 92 (item 4), 91 (item 5)\n*   **Outside Offer (Player 2):** 1593\n*   **Current Offer to Player 2:** 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** 0.9 per round\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to Player 2:\n\n*   Item 1: 1 unit * 92 = 92\n*   Item 2: 3 units * 14 = 42\n*   Item 3: 1 unit * 10 = 10\n*   Item 4: 0 units * 92 = 0\n*   Item 5: 4 units * 91 = 364\n*   **Total Value of Current Offer:** 92 + 42 + 10 + 0 + 364 = 508\n\n**Strategic Considerations**\n\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 1593. If I walk away, I get 1593.\n*   **Current Offer vs. Outside Offer:** The current offer of 508 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1593.\n*   **Negotiation Dynamics:**  There are two rounds left. I need to consider what Player 1 might accept, and the discount factor of 0.9. If a deal isn't reached until round 3, the value is multiplied by 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nThe current offer is not good. Accepting it would give me only 508, while walking away guarantees me 1593. The key is whether I can propose a counteroffer that Player 1 would accept, and that would provide me with more than 1593 * 0.9 = 1433.7. If I think there is a reasonable chance I can get an offer worth over 1433.7 in round 2 (taking into account the discount), that is the play.\n\nLet's think about a fair distribution. The total value of all items to me is 5*92 + 5*14 + 4*10 + 4*92 + 8*91 = 460 + 70 + 40 + 368 + 728 = 1666. If we were splitting the surplus evenly, I should get about 833. This isn't necessarily how it will go, but it is worth considering when thinking about a counter offer.\n\nThe current offer skews very heavily in Player 1's favor. Since I value item 1 and item 4 significantly higher than item 2 and item 3, I'll try and skew the deal to give myself more of items 1, 4 and 5. I value item 5 quite highly too. Player 1 has offered me 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\nLet's try and give Player 1 two of items 1 and 4, one of item 5, and keep items 2 and 3 for myself. That's a counteroffer of [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]. I would receive 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 7 of item 5. This would give me 3*92 + 5*14 + 4*10 + 2*92 + 7*91 = 276 + 70 + 40 + 184 + 637 = 1207. This isn't great, especially given the outside offer is 1593, and it would be discounted by another 0.9. This offer is probably too greedy.\n\nLet's try a different offer where I give Player 1 1 of items 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. That is a counteroffer of [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]. Then, I would receive 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 5 of item 5. This would give me 4*92 + 3*14 + 3*10 + 3*92 + 5*91 = 368 + 42 + 30 + 276 + 455 = 1171.\nThis is also too low relative to the outside offer.\n\nLet's go bolder with a counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]. That way I would be giving Player 1 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. I would receive 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 6 of item 5. The value to me is 4*92 + 4*14 + 4*10 + 3*92 + 6*91 = 368 + 56 + 40 + 276 + 546 = 1286. Still not great.\n\nI'm still hesitant to accept less than 1593 * 0.9.\n\n**Action**\n\nI will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

This means I would get:\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   2 units of item 2\n*   0 units of item 3\n*   0 units of item 4\n*   3 units of item 5\n\nThe value of this offer to me is:\n(1 * 92) + (2 * 14) + (0 * 10) + (0 * 92) + (3 * 91) = 92 + 28 + 0 + 0 + 273 = 393\nSince this is round 2, I need to discount this value by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\nSo the present value of accepting this offer is 393 * 0.9 = 353.7\n\nMy outside option is 1593. Discounted, it is 1593 * 0.9 = 1433.7 (if I walk in round 2).\n\nNow, let's consider the previous offers.\nRound 1, Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 0, 4] to me.\nRound 1, I offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 2] to Player 1.\n\nI need to think about what Player 1's values might be, but without that information, I need to make a decision based on my own values and my outside option. The current offer is significantly lower than my outside option.\n\nI'm going to make a counteroffer. I need to decide how much to offer Player 1. There are 5 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 8 of item 5.\nIf I accept Player 1's current offer, they get:\n*   Item 1: 5 - 1 = 4\n*   Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3\n*   Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4\n*   Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4\n*   Item 5: 8 - 3 = 5\n\nI will make a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside option * 1/0.9 to account for the discount factor.\nLet me propose giving Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get all the items. My value would be:\n(5 * 92) + (5 * 14) + (4 * 10) + (4 * 92) + (8 * 91) = 460 + 70 + 40 + 368 + 728 = 1666.\nDiscounted value = 1666 * 0.9 = 1499.4\nNow consider offer [2, 3, 2, 2, 4] to player 1.

Let's offer them [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nMy values will now be:\n(4 * 92) + (4 * 14) + (3 * 10) + (3 * 92) + (7 * 91) = 368 + 56 + 30 + 276 + 637 = 1367.\nDiscounted = 1367*0.9 = 1230.3\n\nSince the previous offer to me from player 1 was [1,2,0,0,3], I propose a counteroffer such that player 1 receives at least this much back. If I propose [1,2,0,0,3], the value to me will be:\n(4 * 92) + (3 * 14) + (4 * 10) + (4 * 92) + (5 * 91) = 368 + 42 + 40 + 368 + 455 = 1273\nDiscounted value = 1273 * 0.9 = 1145.7\n\nMy outside option is 1433.7 in discounted value.

To make an effective initial offer, I need to leave myself a margin that is higher than my outside offer, ensuring a strong position in the negotiation.\n\nSince it is the first round, I can start with an offer that aims to keep a significant portion for myself, but not too aggressive to ensure it encourages further negotiation. Here\u2019s a balanced offer approach:\n\n- Propose to give a majority of the lower value items and keep a reasonable amount of high-value items for myself. This would be a strategic way to gain a decent worth while leaving room for negotiation.\n\n### Initial Offer Proposal\n- Item 1: Offer 3 units to Player 2 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- Item 2: Offer 2 units to Player 2 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- Item 3: Offer 3 units to Player 2 (keeping 0 for myself)\n- Item 4: Offer 0 units to Player 2 (keeping 1 for myself)\n- Item 5: Offer 2 units to Player 2 (keeping 3 for myself)\n\nThe values left for me with this offer:\n- Item 1: 4 units x 40 = 160\n- Item 2: 4 units x 82 = 328\n- Item 3: 0 units x 4 = 0\n- Item 4: 1 unit x 85 = 85\n- Item 5: 3 units x 18 = 54\n\nTotal value for me = 160 + 328 + 0 + 85 + 54 = 627.\n\nThis value for me (627) is above my outside offer (598).

My private values are 94, 48, 12, 2, and 13 for items 1 through 5. My outside offer is 388. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(3 * 94) + (0 * 48) + (2 * 12) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 13) = 282 + 0 + 24 + 4 + 13 = 323.\n\nNow, let's consider the value of walking away. Walking away gives me my outside offer of 388.  Since 388 > 323, walking away is currently better than accepting the offer.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1. If I make a counteroffer and reach an agreement in round 2, my value will be multiplied by 0.9.  If we reach an agreement in round 3, it will be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81.  I need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer would be.\n\nI have 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. Player 1 is offering me 3, 0, 2, 2, 1 respectively. This means they are keeping 2, 1, 3, 2, 3 units, respectively.\n\nTo decide on a counteroffer, I need to consider Player 1's potential values. Since they are drawn from a uniform distribution of 1 to 101, their average value is roughly 51. Let's see what would happen if I offered them a split such that they receive roughly half of the total possible value, adjusting for their quantities.\n\nLet's aim for a split where I get slightly more than my outside option, considering the discount factor. Suppose I want to achieve approximately 388/0.9 = 431 in round 2.\n\nLet x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 be the amount of items 1 to 5 I keep. Player 1 will then receive 5-x1, 1-x2, 5-x3, 4-x4, 4-x5 respectively. My value will be 94x1 + 48x2 + 12x3 + 2x4 + 13x5 = 431.\n\nLet's try to offer Player 1 close to what they initially asked for and see if I can make a profitable adjustment. I was offered [3, 0, 2, 2, 1], meaning player 1 had [2, 1, 3, 2, 3].\n\nIf I offer [2, 1, 3, 2, 3], then I get [3, 0, 2, 2, 1]. My value = 323. 323*0.9 = 290.7, which is less than 388.\n\nLet's be more aggressive. I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 388/0.9 = 431.\n\nSince item 1 has the highest value for me, I want to keep as much as possible. Let's try offering Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. Then I would get [4, 1, 4, 3, 3]. My value = (4 * 94) + (1 * 48) + (4 * 12) + (3 * 2) + (3 * 13) = 376 + 48 + 48 + 6 + 39 = 517. 517 * 0.9 = 465.3 > 388.\n\nThis looks more promising.

I have to decide whether to accept, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 60 (2 units available)\n- Item 2: 50 (1 unit available)\n- Item 3: 50 (3 units available)\n- Item 4: 60 (4 units available)\n- Item 5: 58 (1 unit available)\nOutside offer: 130\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(0 * 60) + (0 * 50) + (1 * 50) + (3 * 60) + (0 * 58) = 0 + 0 + 50 + 180 + 0 = 230\n\nSince my outside offer is 130, the current offer of 230 is already better than walking away. However, it's round 1, and there's a discount factor of 0.9 to consider in later rounds. Let's think about the best possible outcome for me and then consider a reasonable counteroffer. The total value of all the items to me is 618. If I got everything, I would have 618. If I take the offer, my discounted value would be 230 * 0.9^0 = 230.\n\nNow let's think about what Player 1 is getting if I accept. Player 1 would get:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 1 unit\nI don't know Player 1's values, so it's difficult to predict their strategy. I can assume that they're trying to maximize their own value.\n\nIf I counteroffer, I want to aim for something that's better than my outside option and also leaves Player 1 with something worthwhile, encouraging them to accept in round 2 and avoid the round 3 discount. I need to figure out a better split. Let's try offering them the following:\n\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 0\n\nThis would mean I get:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be: (1*60) + (1*50) + (2*50) + (3*60) + (1*58) = 60 + 50 + 100 + 180 + 58 = 448\nThis would be better than the current offer of 230, but it's a significant cut from the total. It's also a reasonable counteroffer as it is also much better than my outside option. Let's see if I can increase the value a bit without pushing too much.\n\nLet's try offering player 1:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 0\n\nThis would mean I get:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be: (1*60) + (1*50) + (2*50) + (4*60) + (1*58) = 60 + 50 + 100 + 240 + 58 = 508\n\nThis seems pretty reasonable.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n",

My private values are 7, 85, 98, 76, 78 for items 1 through 5. My outside offer is 513. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(2 * 7) + (3 * 85) + (1 * 98) + (1 * 76) + (2 * 78) = 14 + 255 + 98 + 76 + 156 = 699\n\nSince my outside offer is 513, and the current offer is worth 699 to me, it is better than walking away *at this point in time*. However, I need to consider whether making a counteroffer would be more beneficial.\n\nIf I accept now, my value is 699.\n\nLet's consider a possible counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I should try to give Player 1 items that I value less and keep items that I value more. Items 1 and 4 have the lowest value to me. Items 2, 3, and 5 have relatively high values.\n\nIf I propose to give player 1 all of item 1 and 4. Offer: [4,0,0,2,0].\nThis would mean that I get the remaining: [0,4,4,0,5]. The value of this is (0 * 7) + (4 * 85) + (4 * 98) + (0 * 76) + (5 * 78) = 0 + 340 + 392 + 0 + 390 = 1122.\nDiscounted to round 2 it is 1122*0.9 = 1009.8.\n\nLet's analyze whether I should accept the offer of [2, 3, 1, 1, 2]. If I accept now I get 699.\nIf I make a counteroffer, my value will be my final offer discounted by 0.9.\n\nI want to offer player 1 the lowest value items.\nI could offer them all of item 1 and all of item 4. Offer: [4,0,0,2,0]. Then I would get the remaining items [0, 4, 4, 0, 5]. Value of this to me is (0 * 7) + (4 * 85) + (4 * 98) + (0 * 76) + (5 * 78) = 0 + 340 + 392 + 0 + 390 = 1122. This is a good outcome for me, better than 699. Discounting this, 1122*0.9 = 1009.8.\nI could offer slightly better than their value of 699, say 750. I could give them one of the expensive items and some of the cheap ones.\nLet's consider accepting the offer.\n\nSince 699 is better than my outside offer of 513, and since this is the first round, I believe I should make a counteroffer in an attempt to increase my value.\nI will offer Player 1 the following: [4, 0, 0, 2, 0].

If I walk away, I get 513. Since 532.8 > 513, accepting the offer is better than walking away right now.\n\nHowever, it's still round 2, so I could potentially make a counteroffer.

The offer is [1, 1, 1, 3, 1], which means I get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My private values are 19, 65, 91, 3, and 31, respectively. So, the value of this offer to me is:\n\n(1 * 19) + (1 * 65) + (1 * 91) + (3 * 3) + (1 * 31) = 19 + 65 + 91 + 9 + 31 = 215\n\nNow I need to consider the other options.\n\n*   **WALK:** If I walk, I get my outside offer of 151.\n*   **ACCEPT:** If I accept, I get 215.\n*   **COUNTEROFFER:** If I make a counteroffer, it could potentially get me a better outcome, but it also carries the risk of the negotiation falling apart in later rounds and ending up with my outside option or nothing.\n\nSince my outside offer is 151 and the current offer nets me 215, accepting is better than walking away right now. However, there may be a more favorable outcome to be had if I propose a counteroffer.\n\nTo determine a good counteroffer, I will consider the items I value highly, and try to keep more of those, while offering more of the less valuable items to Player 1. My values are 19, 65, 91, 3, 31 for items 1-5 respectively. My highest values are for items 3 and 2. I should try to retain more of these items. Item 4 is my lowest value, so I should offer those to Player 1. Let's propose an offer where I give Player 1: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.

My private values are 83, 39, 33, 22, 28 for items 1 through 5. My outside offer is 46. The total quantities of items are 3, 2, 4, 5, 7.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the value of Player 1's offer to me:\n(2 * 83) + (1 * 39) + (2 * 33) + (3 * 22) + (4 * 28) = 166 + 39 + 66 + 66 + 112 = 449\n\nNow I need to determine what I would get if I accepted the offer, versus what I would get from walking away.\nAccepting gives me a value of 449. Walking away gives me a value of 46.\nSince 449 > 46, it is better to accept than walk away at this stage.\n\nHowever, it's Round 1, and there are two more rounds to potentially improve the deal. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nI need to consider what a good counteroffer would be. To do that, I need to calculate the total value of all the items to me:\n(3 * 83) + (2 * 39) + (4 * 33) + (5 * 22) + (7 * 28) = 249 + 78 + 132 + 110 + 196 = 765\n\nIf I were to propose a split that gives Player 1 nothing, then I get a value of 765. If I accept the current offer, I get 449.\n\nLet's see what Player 1 gets from the current offer. I need to know the values of Player 1. Since I do not know those values, I will aim to improve my offer by making a counteroffer.\n\nMy current offer is [2, 1, 2, 3, 4] to me. That means that Player 1 receives [3-2, 2-1, 4-2, 5-3, 7-4] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3].\nI will propose a split where I take almost everything, giving Player 1 the minimum possible and still making it better than my outside option (discounted by the rounds.)\n\nMy outside option is 46. I need to improve on that and account for the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nI will propose giving Player 1 only one unit of item 4 to Player 1, so Player 1 receives [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\nThat means I get: [3, 2, 4, 4, 7]. This is a value of: (3*83)+(2*39)+(4*33)+(4*22)+(7*28) = 249+78+132+88+196 = 743.\nThis is pretty close to the max value.\n\nI need to propose a split of items that yields [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] for Player 1.

Player 1 is currently offering me [1, 0, 1, 2, 3].\nTotal items: 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 7 of item 5.\nTherefore, if I offer Player 1 [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5], I would receive [3-x1, 2-x2, 4-x3, 5-x4, 7-x5].\n\nMy goal is to maximize my discounted payoff. If I make a counteroffer this round and Player 1 rejects it, I will have to WALK next round, resulting in my outside offer value of 46 * 0.9^2 = 37.26. So, whatever offer I make, I need it to be high enough that Player 1 will accept it. But more importantly, it needs to be more beneficial than simply accepting the offer.\n\nMy current value is 219.6 > 46.\n\nLet's evaluate Player 1's offer from Round 1: [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]. This means Player 1 would keep 1, 1, 2, 2, 3 respectively.\n\nThe current offer gives me 244 * 0.9 = 219.6. Walking gives me 46.\nConsider the final round. I would walk if the offer is bad since the discount is 0.9 * 46 = 41.4\n\nLet's try a counteroffer that gives me a bit more but not too much. I need to leave Player 1 with something of value as well.\nLet's make a very conservative offer to make sure they accept it.\nHow about [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nThis results in me receiving 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\nMy value: 2*83 + 1*39 + 3*33 + 4*22 + 6*28 = 166 + 39 + 99 + 88 + 168 = 560.\n\nDiscounted value 560 * 0.9 = 504.

This means I would get 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy values are: 97 for item 1, 7 for item 2, 16 for item 3, 98 for item 4, 11 for item 5.\nTherefore, the value of Player 1's offer to me is: (3 * 97) + (0 * 7) + (2 * 16) + (1 * 98) + (1 * 11) = 291 + 0 + 32 + 98 + 11 = 432.\nSince it's round 2, this value will be discounted by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of accepting this offer is 432 * 0.9 = 388.8.\n\nMy outside offer is 171. So, if I walk away, I get 171.\n\nIn round 1, I offered Player 1 [4, 1, 2, 0, 1]. This means I wanted [1, 2, 2, 2, 2] for myself. Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 0, 0] in round 1.\n\nPlayer 1's current offer is [3, 0, 2, 1, 1]. Let's think about making a counteroffer. I need to decide if there's a better outcome than accepting 388.8 or walking away with 171. We are in round 2, so making a deal is relatively better than round 3 due to discounting. If I make a counteroffer and it's not accepted in round 3, I walk away with 171.\n\nLet's aim for a split that gives me at least my outside offer value when discounted, so a value of 171/0.9 = 190 before discounting.\nAlso consider the maximum value that I can get, which is (5*97) + (3*7) + (4*16) + (2*98) + (3*11) = 485 + 21 + 64 + 196 + 33 = 799. If I make a counteroffer, I need to leave some value for Player 1, such as [1,1,1,1,1]. The value for myself becomes: (4*97) + (2*7) + (3*16) + (1*98) + (2*11) = 388 + 14 + 48 + 98 + 22 = 570.\n570 * 0.9 = 513.\n\nIf I can get close to this number by giving less to Player 1, I should do it, but if I counter offer with values that are too high for me, I should just accept.\n\nMy values are much higher for item 1 and 4 than item 2,3, and 5.\nPlayer 1's latest offer [3, 0, 2, 1, 1].\nCurrent value for me is 388.8 if I accept.\nI need to get at least 190 if I counteroffer to be better than walking away.\n\nLet's try to get as many items 1 and 4 as possible.\nLet's counteroffer [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]. This means I would get [3, 2, 2, 2, 1]. My value then becomes (3*97) + (2*7) + (2*16) + (2*98) + (1*11) = 291 + 14 + 32 + 196 + 11 = 544\n544 * 0.9 = 489.6. This is better than the current offer.\n\nSo, let's make this counteroffer: [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

My private values are 42, 40, 16, 71, 78 for items 1 through 5 respectively, and my outside offer is 142. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 42) + (2 * 40) + (0 * 16) + (0 * 71) + (2 * 78) = 42 + 80 + 0 + 0 + 156 = 278\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario if I accept. My value will be 278. If I walk away, my value will be 142. Therefore, accepting is better than walking away right now. However, it's round 1, so I should consider making a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.\n\nTo determine a good counteroffer, I need to estimate Player 1's values. Since I don't know their values, I'll assume they are rational and trying to maximize their own utility. I need to make an offer that is attractive to Player 1 but also increases my own value. I also need to think about the next round's discount factor (0.9).\n\nThe total amounts of each item are: 3, 5, 0, 1, 5. The offer to me is: 1, 2, 0, 0, 2.\nThis means that the offer to Player 1 is implicitly: 2, 3, 0, 1, 3.\n\nLet's try to come up with a counteroffer where I give player 1 slightly more while significantly increasing my own value. I will offer Player 1 the following: [2, 4, 0, 1, 4].\n\nThis implies I will get [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. My value for this would be:\n(1 * 42) + (1 * 40) + (0 * 16) + (0 * 71) + (1 * 78) = 42 + 40 + 0 + 0 + 78 = 160\nIt's very likely that Player 1's values are such that they are already happy with [2, 3, 0, 1, 3]. So let me try to push for a better deal by offering slightly less favorable terms to them.\n\nConsider offering Player 1 [1, 3, 0, 0, 3]. This leaves me with [2, 2, 0, 1, 2].\nMy value is (2 * 42) + (2 * 40) + (0 * 16) + (1 * 71) + (2 * 78) = 84 + 80 + 0 + 71 + 156 = 391\nThis is a significantly better deal for me than accepting the current offer.\n\nLet me try to offer slightly less. Consider offering Player 1 [1, 3, 0, 0, 3]. This leaves me with [2, 2, 0, 1, 2].\nMy value is (2 * 42) + (2 * 40) + (0 * 16) + (1 * 71) + (2 * 78) = 84 + 80 + 0 + 71 + 156 = 391\n\nNow let's try a slightly more aggressive offer. I offer Player 1 [0, 3, 0, 0, 3]. This leaves me with [3, 2, 0, 1, 2].\nMy value is (3 * 42) + (2 * 40) + (0 * 16) + (1 * 71) + (2 * 78) = 126 + 80 + 0 + 71 + 156 = 433\nThis is even better.\n\nFinal decision: The offer of [0, 3, 0, 0, 3] seems like a good starting point. It gives me a very high value if accepted, and it might be attractive enough to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

This means I get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are: 42 for item 1, 40 for item 2, 16 for item 3, 71 for item 4, 78 for item 5.\n\nTherefore, the value of Player 1's current offer to me is (0 * 42) + (2 * 40) + (0 * 16) + (0 * 71) + (2 * 78) = 0 + 80 + 0 + 0 + 156 = 236.  Since it's round 2, I need to multiply this by the discount factor gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  So the present value of accepting this offer is 236 * 0.9 = 212.4.\n\nMy outside offer is 142. If I walk away, that's what I get.\n\nNow let's think about a possible counteroffer. I have:\n* 3 units of item 1\n* 5 units of item 2\n* 0 units of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 5 units of item 5\n\nPlayer 1 is currently asking for [0, 2, 0, 0, 2], and in round 1, they asked for [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]. Their asks aren't drastically changing between rounds.\n\nI need to decide whether to accept the current offer (212.4), walk away (142), or make a counteroffer. If I make a counteroffer and it's not accepted, I'm essentially walking away in round 3 (game ends). So I want to make sure my counteroffer is reasonable and likely to be accepted.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items for Player 1. We don't know their values, but we can use this to inform our counteroffer in relation to the total item value.\n\nLet's try to offer slightly more than what player 1 requested in Round 2 and see if that is worthwhile and above my outside option, 142. My goal is to get more overall value from this deal than my outside offer. I'll offer player 1: [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\nValue to me of keeping the rest:\nItems left for me:\nItem 1: 3-1 = 2\nItem 2: 5-2 = 3\nItem 3: 0-0 = 0\nItem 4: 1-0 = 1\nItem 5: 5-2 = 3\n\nValue to me: (2 * 42) + (3 * 40) + (0 * 16) + (1 * 71) + (3 * 78) = 84 + 120 + 0 + 71 + 234 = 509. With the discount factor, it is 509 * 0.9 = 458.1\n\nSince 458.1 > 212.4, my previous round analysis was insufficient. The important part now is maximizing my outcome considering the discounted payoff.\nSince 458.1 > 142, this still makes sense. So I will proceed with offering player 1 the first round offer again: [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]}\n",

Since the negotiation proceeds in rounds and the potential total value of items to me is 1315, I need to aim for an offer that gives me more than my outside offer when considering the discount rate over potential rounds.\n\nLet's break down the value of each item:\n\n- Item 1: 4 units, value 100 per unit, total value = 4 * 100 = 400\n- Item 2: 3 units, value 13 per unit, total value = 3 * 13 = 39\n- Item 3: 5 units, value 64 per unit, total value = 5 * 64 = 320\n- Item 4: 4 units, value 98 per unit, total value = 4 * 98 = 392\n- Item 5: 4 units, value 41 per unit, total value = 4 * 41 = 164\n\nTotal value of all items if I receive everything is 1315.\n\nTo maximize my value greater than my outside offer adjusted by potential round persistence (especially considering the discount factor 0.9), I should attempt to receive items that maximize my value. Item 1 and Item 4 are of highest per unit value to me.\n\nA strategy is to offer Player 2 fewer valuable items in terms of my perspective but ensure it's a reasonable starting point for a counter offer.\n\nConsidering I want more than 1119, I need to give less value than my outside. Let\u2019s propose a reasonable starting offer that entices negotiation:\n\n1. Offer lower units of high-value items like item 1 and item 4\n2. Offer an attractive amount of moderate-value items\n\nI will offer:\n- Item 1: 0 units (keep all valuable ones)\n- Item 2: 3 units (since it's of low value to me)\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 0 units (keep all valuable ones)\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nEvaluating my offer:\n- If accepted, I keep 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy value from this offer:\n- Value from item 1: 400\n- Value from item 2: 0\n- Value from item 3: 3 * 64 = 192\n- Value from item 4: 392\n- Value from item 5: 2 * 41 = 82\n\nAggregate value: 400 + 0 + 192 + 392 + 82 = 1066\n\nAdjusted for one round at 0.9: 1066, which is less than 1119. Thus, I slightly readjust the offer to ensure I am enticing enough but viable for negotiation, considering potential rounds:\n\nChange to give only 1 unit of item 3 and 1 additional item 5 so more is retained by me.\n\nUpdated plausible counter:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 1 units\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nFinal reevaluation:\n- Keep 4 units item 1, value 400\n- Keep 0 units item 2, value 0\n- Keep 4 units item 3, value 256\n- Keep 4 units item 4, value 392\n- Keep 1 units item 5, value 41\n\nNew value: 400 + 0 + 256 + 392 + 41 = 1089 x 0.9 = 980, still below, I can make this slightly more enticing.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 0, 3]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 has offered me [1, 3, 2, 1, 4] of items 1 through 5 respectively. My values for these items are 99, 92, 88, 13, and 94. My outside offer is 58, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 99) + (3 * 92) + (2 * 88) + (1 * 13) + (4 * 94) = 99 + 276 + 176 + 13 + 376 = 940\n\nNow, we need to consider the discounted value in the final round. If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer in round 2, it will be treated as a walk at round 3. Therefore, I will receive my outside offer value of 58, multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. 58 * 0.9 = 52.2. Since the current offer (940) * 0.9 is worth 846 > 58, I can probably make a deal at better terms than my walkaway.\n\nGiven the current offer yields me 940, let us consider what player 1 would get with my counteroffer.\nI have 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 4 units of item 5.\nMy values are 99, 92, 88, 13, 94.\nTotal value is 4*99 + 3*92 + 5*88 + 4*13 + 4*94 = 396 + 276 + 440 + 52 + 376 = 1540\nIf I accept the current offer, I get 940 and player 1 gets 1540 - 940 = 600.\n\nLet's consider what would happen if I offered Player 1 almost everything. My values are much higher for most items.\nIf I gave player 1 [3, 3, 5, 4, 4], then I keep [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nMy value would be 1 * 99 = 99. 99 * 0.9 = 89.1 < outside value. This is not a good offer.\n\nLet's try to aim for a split closer to the middle.\nWhat if I aim for a 70/30 split between me and player 1.\nThat means, I aim for 1540 * 0.7 = 1078 and Player 1 aims for 1540 * 0.3 = 462.\n\nThe current offer gives me 940 so player 1 is getting about 600.\n\nGiven that this is Round 2, and if I counteroffer it will be the last chance, and it will be considered a WALK if this is round 3.\nLet's offer a counteroffer where I get at least my discounted outside offer.\nI need at least 58/0.9 = 64.4 to make it better than walking away.\n\nLet me see what happens if I offer [2, 2, 3, 2, 2].\nMy value becomes 2*99 + 1*92 + 2*88 + 2*13 + 2*94 = 198 + 92 + 176 + 26 + 188 = 680\nTheir share is 1540 - 680 = 860.\nTheir offer would be better as well.\n\nIt is in my best interest to accept the current offer, since my outside offer is 58.\n940 is the best I can get at round 2. 940 * 0.9 is much better than 58.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

It is wise to keep those.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer:\n- Offer most of the less valuable items (2 and 5) to Player 2.\n- Retain high-value items (especially 3 and 4) for myself.\n\nA logical initial offer could be:\n- Item 1: 3 units to Player 2, keep 6 for myself (my value = 192)\n- Item 2: 5 units to Player 2, keep 1 for myself (my value = 12)\n- Item 3: 0 units to Player 2, keep all for myself (my value = 364)\n- Item 4: 0 units to Player 2, keep all for myself (my value = 158)\n- Item 5: 2 units to Player 2, keep 1 for myself (my value = 1)\n\nMy total value in this scenario: 192 + 12 + 364 + 158 + 1 = 727. This is higher than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, the offer I propose to Player 2 is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 5, 0, 0, 2]}",

This means they would get [6, 1, 4, 2, 1].\n\n**My Values:** My values are 89, 84, 4, 93, 5 for items 1-5.\n\n**Player 1's Offer Value to Me:**\n*   3 * 89 + 5 * 84 + 0 * 4 + 0 * 93 + 2 * 5 = 267 + 420 + 0 + 0 + 10 = 697\n\n**My Outside Offer:** 128\n\n**Total Value of all Items to Me:** 1522\n\n**Remaining Rounds:** 3\n\n**Discount Factor:** 0.9\n\nNow, let's consider the possible actions:\n\n1.  **ACCEPT:** If I accept, I get 697.\n\n2.  **WALK:** If I walk, I get 128.\n\n3.  **COUNTEROFFER:** This is the most complex. I need to consider what Player 1 might accept and what my value will be, discounted by the round. Since it is round 1, the discount is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nTo decide on a counteroffer, I need to estimate Player 1's values. Since they are drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 101, a reasonable guess would be a value in the middle, or around 51. Let's assume Player 1's values are roughly around this average for now. To make an informed decision, I need to get a good estimation of Player 1's private values for each item. In the real world, I would try to get these estimates from the negotiation, but with a single round, I have no information about player 1 values. Thus, I make the counteroffer decision based purely on my own values.\n\nI want to maximize my gain while making a reasonable offer to Player 1. The items I value most are 1, 2, and 4. The current offer is strong in item 1 and item 2, so I want to ensure they continue to receive a large portion of those items, otherwise, they are likely to refuse the offer. Item 4 would be my focus for negotiation. In the current offer, they are receiving all of item 4. I want to make an offer that results in me receiving some of item 4.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a bit more of the less valuable items for me (3 and 5) to try to get some of item 4 back. I will offer Player 1 [6, 1, 3, 1, 2]. This means they get all but one unit of item 1 and all of item 2. Then I offer a little more of item 3 and item 5, and leave me with 1 unit of item 4.\nThis yields a payout of 697.\n\nIf I choose to walk away, I will only receive 128.\n\nTherefore, the counteroffer is the only reasonable option. I will offer [6, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 1, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

Therefore, the present value of this offer is 622 * 0.9 = 559.8.\n\nMy outside offer is 128.\n\nNow, I need to consider the previous offers and Player 1's behavior. In round 1, Player 1 offered me [3, 5, 0, 0, 2], which has a value of (3 * 89) + (5 * 84) + (0 * 4) + (0 * 93) + (2 * 5) = 267 + 420 + 0 + 0 + 10 = 697.

The discount factor will then be 0.9^2 = 0.81. This means that I would need to get a significant amount of value in the final round to make it worthwhile, which is not guaranteed.\n\nComparing 559.8 with my outside offer of 128, the offer is significantly better than walking away right now. Given Player 1 lowered their ask for Item 2 and offered me more of Item 1 and Item 3, it is likely they will concede more.\n\nTherefore, it may be worthwhile to try one last counteroffer, but to calculate an exact one would be very difficult and time consuming. However, walking away will give me 128 guaranteed.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]. This means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 12\n- Item 2: 10\n- Item 3: 33\n- Item 4: 61\n- Item 5: 99\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 12) + (1 * 10) + (0 * 33) + (1 * 61) + (2 * 99) = 12 + 10 + 0 + 61 + 198 = 281\n\nMy outside offer is 887.\n\nIf I accept the current offer, my value is 281. If I walk away, my value is 887.\n\nSince it is round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect the current values. However, it will affect the next round if there is one.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to decide what is the minimum I am willing to accept and offer a counteroffer that is a little bit better than that amount from Player 1's perspective.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the value of giving everything to Player 1. The total number of each item:\n- Item 1: 5\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 7\n\nMy value for all items is 1103. Therefore Player 1's value for all items must be greater than 0. The only thing I know about Player 1's values is that they are in the range [1, 101].\n\nI want to determine if I should counteroffer or walk. If I counteroffer, it must be good enough that player 1 accepts. I think it is likely Player 1's valuation of the items is substantially higher than 281. I should offer a counteroffer which gives player 1 a large proportion of the items and is beneficial for me.\nLet me think about this for another minute.\n\nOkay, my outside option is 887. I need to get at least 887 from this negotiation. Given the current offer is worth 281, it is quite far from my outside offer.\n\nI will try to make a counteroffer. My goal is to offer player 1 a sufficient amount to accept, but I also have to take into account that there are only 3 rounds. In addition, there is the discount factor of 0.9.\n\nLet's try to leave player 1 with 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This means I will get 3 units of item 1, 3 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\nMy value will be (3*12) + (3*10) + (1*33) + (3*61) + (4*99) = 36 + 30 + 33 + 183 + 396 = 678\n\nMy value after discount would be 678*0.9 = 610.2. Still lower than my outside option. \n\nThis time, I will offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I will receive everything. The value is 1103 which is higher than my outside option 887.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This is not a reasonable or acceptable offer.\n\n2. **My Valuation:**\n   - Item 1: 5 units * 36 = 180\n   - Item 2: 4 units * 60 = 240\n   - Item 3: 2 units * 39 = 78\n   - Item 4: 4 units * 34 = 136\n   - Item 5: 7 units * 37 = 259\n   Total Value = 893\n\n3. **Outside Offer**: My outside offer is 132.\n\n4. **Discount Factor**: With the discount factor (gamma = 0.9), my potential acceptance value for this round should be calculated by considering the next round's impact if the negotiation extends.\n\n5. **Evaluating Options:**\n   - If I accept the current offer (even though it's not feasible because it's [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] meaning nothing is offered), my value would technically be my full potential which is 893. However, this round's offer is zero from Player 2 which is invalid for my benefit.\n   - If we walk away, I have a guaranteed value of 132 based on my outside offer.\n\n6. **Strategic Move:**\n   - Since Player 2's current offer is effectively passing back the entire set of items to me without a fair division, Player 2 is signaling either they strongly prefer the outcome to reflect a different valuation or they're probing for better counter offers.\n   - I should propose a more balanced counteroffer that will potentially be acceptable in the next round unless they also prefer to walk away.\n \n7. **Counteroffer Proposal:**\n   - An aim here is to secure higher valued items and enough total value above my outside offer, while also making a reasonable show for Player 2.\n\n   Let's assume we could try a counteroffer such as [2, 2, 1, 2, 3], which splits items more evenly than the initial round offer, while still maintaining significant value for myself based on my valuations:\n   - I keep: [3, 2, 1, 2, 4] maximizing my value while keeping it viable for the other player to consider.\n\nTherefore, my chosen action is to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

This means Player 1 is offering me 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 90\n- Item 2: 9\n- Item 3: 91\n- Item 4: 9\n- Item 5: 91\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(2 * 90) + (3 * 9) + (0 * 91) + (1 * 9) + (3 * 91) = 180 + 27 + 0 + 9 + 273 = 489\n\nMy outside offer is 771.\n\nIf I accept the offer, I get 489. If I walk away, I get 771. Therefore, I should not accept the offer at this stage.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 something that they will accept, while still giving me more than my outside offer (771). I have 5 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nTo formulate a counteroffer, I need to estimate Player 1's valuation of the items. Since the values are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101, a reasonable estimate for their value is 51 for each item. Given that I want more than 771, it is likely a good strategy to give Player 1 the items I value the least. I could offer them all of item 2 (8 units) and item 4 (3 units) and some portion of item 1 or 5. But I could also offer all the items I don't value much.\n\nThe current offer to me is 489. So, I need to formulate a counteroffer where I gain significantly more than 489. It might be better to try to get a deal by offering just slightly more than what is needed to be better than my outside offer. Let's try to make a counteroffer that is relatively fair to both players.\n\nConsider the offer [3, 5, 1, 2, 0].  This leaves me with [2, 3, 0, 1, 3].\nThis current offer values me at 489 as calculated above. Since my outside option is 771, let's consider a better offer.\nHow about [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].  This gives me: (5 * 90) + (8 * 9) + (1 * 91) + (3 * 9) + (3 * 91) = 450 + 72 + 91 + 27 + 273 = 913.\n\nLet's try offering a mix of items: offer Player 1 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.  This would leave me with 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\nMy valuation would be: (3 * 90) + (3 * 9) + (0 * 91) + (1 * 9) + (3 * 91) = 270 + 27 + 0 + 9 + 273 = 579.  This isn't good enough.\n\nLet me offer less on Item 1 and more on Item 5. [1, 5, 1, 2, 0].\nMy valuation: (4 * 90) + (3 * 9) + (0 * 91) + (1 * 9) + (3 * 91) = 360 + 27 + 0 + 9 + 273 = 669. Still not enough.\n\nI'm going to offer a deal with [1, 6, 1, 3, 0].\nMy valuation: (4 * 90) + (2 * 9) + (0 * 91) + (0 * 9) + (3 * 91) = 360 + 18 + 0 + 0 + 273 = 651.\n\nI must make more than 771.\nI will offer [0, 7, 1, 3, 0] to player 1. This means I get [5, 1, 0, 0, 3].\n\nMy valuation is (5 * 90) + (1 * 9) + (0 * 91) + (0 * 9) + (3 * 91) = 450 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 273 = 732.  Still not enough.\n\nI will offer [0, 8, 1, 3, 0] to player 1. This means I get [5, 0, 0, 0, 3].\nMy valuation is (5 * 90) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 91) + (0 * 9) + (3 * 91) = 450 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 273 = 723. Close, but no.\n\nLet's just offer [5,8,1,3,3]. This leaves me with nothing and this has a value of 0.\n\nI will offer [3, 4, 0, 2, 1]. My valuation is (2 * 90) + (4 * 9) + (1 * 91) + (1 * 9) + (2 * 91) = 180 + 36 + 91 + 9 + 182 = 498.\n\nLet's just WALK.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 has just offered me [1, 0, 2, 2, 1] (one unit of item 1, zero units of item 2, two units of item 3, two units of item 4, and one unit of item 5). My values for these items are 52, 78, 73, 20, and 61, respectively. My outside offer is 430, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(1 * 52) + (0 * 78) + (2 * 73) + (2 * 20) + (1 * 61) = 52 + 0 + 146 + 40 + 61 = 299\n\nSince it is round 2, we need to multiply by the discount factor 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nThe discounted value of the current offer is 299 * 0.9 = 269.1\n\nMy outside offer is 430.  Since 269.1 < 430, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. It's crucial to think about what Player 1 might value and what my own values are. I want to make an offer that is better than my walkaway of 430 * 0.9 = 387 (discounted walkaway). I also need to consider the remaining round.\n\nI have a total of 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Player 1's offer gives me 1 of item 1, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n\nI need to calculate what I would give Player 1 to make a reasonable counteroffer that Player 1 will accept in Round 3, assuming I give them x number of each item. If I give them x number of each item my value will be the complement of these numbers, which is 5-x, 2-x, 4-x, 5-x, and 3-x, respectively. Since I don't know Player 1's value per item, let's consider what I would need to offer them in the first round so that they find it better to accept than walking away and so that I do better than accepting their offer.\n\nSince I need to make more than 299 * 0.9 = 269.1 I should definitely counteroffer.\nConsider giving them 2 units of item 1, all 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\nMy value would be 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5\nMy value is 3*52 + 0*78 + 2*73 + 2*20 + 1*61 = 156 + 0 + 146 + 40 + 61 = 403\nThis amount discounted is 403 * 0.9 = 362.7 < 430\n\nHow about I offer Player 1 3 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5\nThis way, my value would be 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5\nMy value is 2*52 + 1*78 + 1*73 + 2*20 + 1*61 = 104 + 78 + 73 + 40 + 61 = 356\n\nSo if I can't get over my outside offer by counteroffering I should just take the outside offer.\nTherefore I will choose to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

So, the present value of accepting this offer is 341 * 1 = 341.\n\n**Comparing with My Outside Offer**\n\nMy outside offer is worth 430.  The current offer (341) is significantly less than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting the offer would be a bad choice.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer**\n\nI need to determine if there's a counteroffer that would be better for me than walking away. I have to estimate what Player 1's values might be to craft a good offer, but without any information on those values, it will be a high risk move.\n\nSince my outside offer is 430, I need to get more than this value from an agreement. Any offer that I make to Player 1 should leave me with more than 430. Let's allocate all of items 3 and 4, to myself along with the remaining amounts of items 1, 2 and 5, while offer player 1 a token amount of item 1. I propose the following distribution to player 1:\n\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 0\n*   Item 3: 0\n*   Item 4: 0\n*   Item 5: 0\n\nThis leaves me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 5\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 2\n*   Item 4: 1\n*   Item 5: 4\n\nValue of offer to me is:\n*   Item 1: 5 * 54 = 270\n*   Item 2: 2 * 71 = 142\n*   Item 3: 2 * 58 = 116\n*   Item 4: 1 * 7 = 7\n*   Item 5: 4 * 92 = 368\n\nTotal Value: 270 + 142 + 116 + 7 + 368 = 903\n\nSince 903 is greater than 430 I will make this offer as my counteroffer.\n\n**Decision**\n\nSince the current offer is worth less than my outside offer, and there is an option to make a counteroffer, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

My value for this offer is 4 * 54 = 216. With the discount factor of 0.9 applied for round 2, the present value of the offer is 216 * 0.9 = 194.4.\n\n**Round 1 History:**\n\n*   Player 1 offered [5, 1, 0, 0, 0] - This means I would get 5 units of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2. My value: (5 * 54) + (1 * 71) = 270 + 71 = 341.\n*   My counteroffer: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] - I offered them 1 unit of item 1, meaning I would get 5 units of item 1. My value: 5*54 = 270\n\n**Player 1's Actions:**\nPlayer 1 is decreasing the amount of item 1 they are offering. They initially offered 5 units of item 1, now they are offering 4 units.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nMy outside option is 430. The current offer, discounted to round 2, is worth 194.4. It is below my outside option, so I should not accept it immediately. Player 1 might be willing to offer more if I counteroffer again.\nI think it's worth making a counteroffer. My goal is to get an offer that's better than my outside option, taking into account the discount factor. It's round 2, so I have one more chance to negotiate.\n\nI should try to get as much of item 5 as possible, given that I value it highly. I want to propose a counteroffer that is more appealing for me than the current offer, or my outside option after round 3 (430*0.9).\n\n**Counteroffer:**\n\nI'll propose a counteroffer that gives Player 1 5 units of Item 1, all of Item 2, all of Item 3, and all of Item 4. This leaves me with 1 unit of Item 1, and all 4 units of Item 5.\nValue to me: (1 * 54) + (4 * 92) = 54 + 368 = 422\nDiscounted to round 2: 422 * 0.9 = 379.8\nThis is still less than my outside option of 430. Let's adjust this by giving them 4 units of Item 5, so I get 4 * 92 = 368. Discounted, this is 368 * 0.9 = 331.2.\nTherefore, my counteroffer will be 5 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 0 units of Item 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 2, 2, 1, 0]}\n",

                    "response": "To make a decision, I need to evaluate the value of the current offer for me and compare it to the value of my outside offer, adjusted for the current round.\n\n### Understanding the Current Offer\n\nThe current offer on the table from Player 2 is: [2, 2, 2, 1, 0]. This means they are offering me:\n\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\n### My Values for Each Item\n\n- Item 1: 80\n- Item 2: 28\n- Item 3: 69\n- Item 4: 87\n- Item 5: 79\n\n### Calculating the Value of the Current Offer\n\nThe value of the offer for me is calculated as follows:\n\n- 2 units of item 1 * 80 = 160\n- 2 units of item 2 * 28 = 56\n- 2 units of item 3 * 69 = 138\n- 1 unit of item 4 * 87 = 87\n- 0 units of item 5 * 79 = 0\n\nTotal value = 160 + 56 + 138 + 87 + 0 = 441\n\n### Adjusting for Round 2 Discount\n\nSince we are in round 2, a discount factor gamma = 0.9 applies. The adjustment for the offer value is:\n\nAdjusted offer value = 441 * (0.9^1) = 441 * 0.9 = 396.9\n\n### Consideration of Outside Offer\n\nMy outside offer is 1192. Since this is a fallback option and is not subject to discounting, its value remains 1192.\n\n### Decision Criteria\n\n- The adjusted value of the current offer (396.9) is much less than my outside offer (1192).\n- Walking away ensures a guaranteed value of 1192.\n\nGiven that the current offer's value after discount is significantly lower than my outside offer, it is more beneficial for me to walk away than to accept the current offer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI will choose to WALK away because my outside offer is substantially more valuable than the offer currently on the table.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means if I walk away, I get 444.\n\n2.  **Consider Counteroffer:** I need to determine if a counteroffer is worthwhile. Since this is round 1, there are two more rounds, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\n3.  **Calculate Maximum Possible Value:** The maximum value I can get if I have all the items is:\n    *   Item 1: 6 * 85 = 510\n    *   Item 2: 8 * 35 = 280\n    *   Item 3: 3 * 40 = 120\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 10 = 40\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 100 = 400\n    *   **Total Maximum Value:** 510 + 280 + 120 + 40 + 400 = 1350\n\n4.  **Determine a reasonable counteroffer:** I want to get at least slightly more than my outside offer discounted by one period to make it worthwhile.

                    "response": "To determine the most rational action, I need to calculate the value of keeping each item versus making a counteroffer or walking away.\n\n### My Values:\n- Item 1: 5 units * 99 = 495\n- Item 2: 3 units * 49 = 147\n- Item 3: 4 units * 42 = 168\n- Item 4: 5 units * 66 = 330\n- Item 5: 6 units * 48 = 288\n\n**Total Value:** 495 + 147 + 168 + 330 + 288 = 1428\n\n### My Outside Offer\nMy outside offer is 134. This means that if I walk away, I get a value of 134.\n\n### Strategy for Round 1\nSetting a strong first offer is critical because my outside offer is relatively low compared to the total value (134 vs 1428). I want to maximize what I keep while making a reasonable starting offer to Player 2 that they might consider for negotiation. \n\n#### Considerations:\n- My offer should allow me to keep a large portion of value in the early rounds.\n- My discount rate should also be considered, which implies that the value of this negotiation might decrease over rounds, but it is only round 1, so the discount factor hasn't been applied yet.\n\n#### Formulate Offer\nTo make the initial offer, I want to retain items with my highest per-unit value more completely while offering fewer of those. Therefore, focusing mainly on offering items 2 and 3 as they are lower value relative to others. \n\nA basic offer can look like:\n\n- Offer 2 units of item 1 (keep 3)\n- Offer 2 units of item 2 (keep 1)\n- Offer 1 unit of item 3 (keep 3)\n- Offer 2 units of item 4 (keep 3)\n- Offer 3 units of item 5 (keep 3)\n\n- Calculating the self-retained value:\n  - 3 units of item 1 at 99 value = 297\n  - 1 unit of item 2 at 49 value = 49\n  - 3 units of item 3 at 42 value = 126\n  - 3 units of item 4 at 66 value = 198\n  - 3 units of item 5 at 48 value = 144\n\nSum of retained values = 297 + 49 + 126 + 198 + 144 = 814\n\nEven without considering the possible discount, retaining a value of 814 in round 1 is strong compared to my outside offer of 134.\n\n### Conclusion\nI'll use the analysis to propose a fair starting offer, intending to adjust based on subsequent negotiations.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for Player 2.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer on the table: [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]. This means Player 1 is offering me 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 6\n- Item 2: 63\n- Item 3: 76\n- Item 4: 33\n- Item 5: 48\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(2 * 6) + (2 * 63) + (1 * 76) + (2 * 33) + (3 * 48) = 12 + 126 + 76 + 66 + 144 = 424\n\nMy outside offer is 771.\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nNow, I need to consider my options:\n\n1.  **ACCEPT:** If I accept, I get a value of 424.\n2.  **WALK:** If I walk, I get my outside offer of 771.\n3.  **COUNTEROFFER:** If I make a counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might accept and the potential value of that deal to me, discounted by 0.9 in subsequent rounds.\n\nSince my outside offer (771) is significantly higher than the current offer (424), accepting is not a good option.\n\nLet's think about a counteroffer. I have:\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 6 units of item 5\n\nto distribute between myself and Player 1.\n\nIf I walk away now, I get 771. To make a counteroffer worthwhile, the expected value of reaching an agreement in rounds 2 or 3 has to be greater than 771. It's hard to know what Player 1 values each item at, so I will aim for a higher value.\n\nGiven that Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 3] to me, it suggests they value item 1, item 2, item 4 and item 5 the most.\n\nLet's try to get as close to my outside offer as possible by making a new offer. I want to keep most of the valuable items.\nI will offer Player 1 the following: [3, 1, 3, 3, 3]. This means I keep:\n- Item 1: 2 units. Value: 2 * 6 = 12\n- Item 2: 2 units. Value: 2 * 63 = 126\n- Item 3: 1 units. Value: 1 * 76 = 76\n- Item 4: 2 units. Value: 2 * 33 = 66\n- Item 5: 3 units. Value: 3 * 48 = 144\n\nTotal value for me: 12 + 126 + 76 + 66 + 144 = 424\n\nSince 424 < 771, I will offer a counteroffer which will get me at least 771.\nI will offer Player 1 the following offer to maximize my value: [3, 0, 4, 5, 6]\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 2 units. Value: 2 * 6 = 12\n- Item 2: 3 units. Value: 3 * 63 = 189\n- Item 3: 0 units. Value: 0 * 76 = 0\n- Item 4: 0 units. Value: 0 * 33 = 0\n- Item 5: 0 units. Value: 0 * 48 = 0\n\nMy total value = 12 + 189 = 201. I would be losing.\nI will WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If Player 1 is rational, they should offer me at least 811 discounted by the number of rounds left (including this one) so I will consider accepting.\n\nLet's consider what would be a good counteroffer. First, I want to keep as much of item 2 as possible since my valuation is very high (81). I also value item 1 and item 4 highly (73 and 70 respectively). I don't really value items 3 and 5, so I can give those away more easily.\n\nHere's an initial idea for a counteroffer, focusing on giving Player 1 items 3 and 5, and a bit of item 1 while retaining as much of items 2 and 4 as possible: I'll give all items 3 and 5 to Player 1, a small amount of item 1, but keep all the items 2 and 4. My outside option is very high so I am happy to risk losing the deal.\n\nCounteroffer (offer to Player 1): [3, 0, 2, 0, 4]\n\nThis means I would get:\n* 2 units of item 1: 2 * 73 = 146\n* 4 units of item 2: 4 * 81 = 324\n* 0 units of item 3: 0\n* 3 units of item 4: 3 * 70 = 210\n* 0 units of item 5: 0\n\nTotal value of counteroffer: 146 + 324 + 0 + 210 + 0 = 680.\n\nSince this is less than my outside option of 811 and there are 2 rounds left, I will walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Therefore, I need to ensure my counteroffer gives me a value higher than 641 (while considering the anticipated value after discount for future rounds).\n\n### Strategy for Initial Counteroffer:\n1. **Maximize high-value items for myself**: I should prioritize getting more units of higher-value items for my side.\n2. **Offer lower-valued items**: I would try to offer Player 2 those items that have less value to me but still could be valuable for them.\n  \nFor this initial offer:\n- **Offer Player 2 minimal of high-value items**: To keep more value for myself.\n- **Give some units of lower-value items**: To entice Player 2 to consider the offer.\n\n### Calculation of Proposed Offer:\n- Offer most of item 3 (since it's least valuable to me): Offer all 4 units.\n- Offer item 1 units: Offer 3 units, keeping 4 for myself (as it has moderate value to me).\n- Offer fewer of high-value items 2, 4, and 5: Offer 1 unit of item 2 and 1 unit of item 4, keep all units of item 5 for me since 65 is quite high.\n\n#### My Offer:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 4 units\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 0 units\n\nThis offer would keep 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, all of item 4, and item 5 for myself, resulting in a high value for me while providing a plausible start for negotiation given my outside option is 641.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the need to negotiate above my threshold and the intention to give Player 2 something of perceived value, my initial offer would be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 4, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's break down this negotiation and figure out the best action for Player 2 in round 2.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n*   **Items:** We have 5 items with quantities (3, 3, 7, 4, 4).\n*   **Values:** Player 2 (that's me) values are (87, 65, 86, 69, 46) per unit.\n*   **Outside Offer:** Player 2's outside offer is 688.\n*   **Discount:** Gamma = 0.9.\n*   **Round:** It's round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 0, 4, 2]. This means Player 1 gets (3-2, 3-1, 7-0, 4-4, 4-2) = [1, 2, 7, 0, 2].\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer**\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to me (Player 2):\n\n*   2 * 87 (item 1) + 1 * 65 (item 2) + 0 * 86 (item 3) + 4 * 69 (item 4) + 2 * 46 (item 5) = 174 + 65 + 0 + 276 + 92 = 607\n\nNow, apply the discount factor:\n\n*   607 * 0.9 = 546.3\n\nSo, the present value of accepting the current offer is 546.3. This is less than my outside offer of 688, so accepting would be a bad deal.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer**\n\nI need to determine if there's a counteroffer that Player 1 would accept and that would give me a better value than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. This is tricky to calculate precisely without knowing Player 1's values, but I can reason strategically.\n\nPlayer 1's previous offer in Round 1 was [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]. This changed to [2, 1, 0, 4, 2] in Round 2. Player 1 seems to have kept the amount of Item 2 the same, while increasing the amounts of Item 1, Item 4 and Item 5 they are offering to me. Player 1 must need a lot of item 3 since they offered 7 units in their first offer, then kept it in their second offer.\n\nLet's calculate my maximum value for the items. That's 3*87 + 3*65 + 7*86 + 4*69 + 4*46 = 261 + 195 + 602 + 276 + 184 = 1518. The value after discounting is 1518 * 0.9 = 1366.2.\n\n**Action**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly below my outside offer, and I need to consider that this is round 2 and I'm getting close to my outside offer, I'm going to go for my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This makes the negotiation less appealing unless I can secure a deal with a higher value after discounting.\n\n4. **Discount Factor:**\n   - Discounting affects how much value I get as rounds progress. The present value of an agreement in any subsequent rounds will be \\(Value \\times \\gamma^{r-1}\\) where \\(r\\) is the round number.\n\n5. **Strategy for the first offer:**\n   - I want to ensure that I retain as much value as possible, ideally equivalent to or greater than 713 when discounted if this deal proceeds beyond Round 1.\n\n6. **Make an Initial Offer:**\n   - I aim to take the high-value items (to me) while offering a reasonable proportion to Player 2. Given that I have no information about Player 2's valuations, I must assume a balanced division might still be attractive for them while favoring my values.\n\n7. **Proposed Offer:**\n   - Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2\n   - Item 2: 0 units to Player 2\n   - Item 3: 2 units to Player 2\n   - Item 4: 3 units to Player 2\n   - Item 5: 5 units to Player 2\n\n  This would give:\n  - To player 2: \\(29 \\times 1 + 0 \\times 75 + 22 \\times 2 + 48 \\times 3 + 10 \\times 5 = 29 + 44 + 144 + 50 = 267\\).\n  - For myself: \\(29 \\times 4 + 75 \\times 1 + 22 \\times 3 + 48 \\times 4 + 10 \\times 2 = 116 + 75 + 66 + 192 + 20 = 469\\).\n\n  The offer needs to balance what I retain to ensure getting more than my outside option discounted, considering Player 2 might counteroffer.\n\nGiven this, my strategic approach aims to maximize my retained value while not initiating with overly aggressive terms.

I need to consider:\n\n    *   What is the maximum Player 1 could value the items? (101 per unit, from the prompt).\n    *   How much value do I need to give Player 1 to make them accept a counteroffer?\n    *   The discount factor: delaying a deal reduces the value.\n\n**Evaluating a Counteroffer Strategy**\n\nSince it's the first round, and the discount factor is 0.9, I have the most leverage. If I make an offer and they walk away, the worst case scenario is that they accept next round with offer which I find acceptable. If I accept the offer, I would get 379, however, my outside offer is 952. I should aim to make a counteroffer that is better than 952 value from my perspective.\nCurrently, player 1 is offering me [1,0,2,3,5]. So player 1 gets [4,1,3,4,2]. Assuming player 1's value is the average of [1,101] which is 51.\n\nThen player 1's total value = 4 * 51 + 1 * 51 + 3 * 51 + 4 * 51 + 2 * 51 = 14 * 51 = 714.\nIf player 1 values all items as 1, their value is 25, and if player 1 values all items as 101, their total value is 2525.\n\nThe current offer to player 1 [4,1,3,4,2] yields a value of V1 * 4 + V2 * 1 + V3 * 3 + V4 * 4 + V5 * 2.\nI believe, that player 1's outside option is related to their possible value for all the items.\n\nConsidering my values are 70, 91, 10, 43, 32. The current offer gives me value 379. To increase that to, for example, 600, I need about (600 - 379) = 221. I could try to shift item 2.\nIf I give them [5,1,5,7,7], that is the best deal for me.\nIf I offer them [0,0,0,0,0], then they are giving me everything, which is the best deal for me.\n\n**Decision**\n\nGiven that the current offer is significantly worse than my outside option, and it's only round 1, I will make a counteroffer that is close to optimal, and hope that the player will accept. My value is 70 * 5 + 91 * 1 + 10 * 5 + 43 * 7 + 32 * 7 = 350 + 91 + 50 + 301 + 224 = 1016\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I need to assess the values involved. Here's how I break it down:\n\n1. **Private Valuation of Items:**\n   - Item 1: 71 per unit\n   - Item 2: 4 per unit\n   - Item 3: 54 per unit\n   - Item 4: 1 per unit\n   - Item 5: 6 per unit\n\n2. **Total Quantity of Items:**\n   - Item 1: 4 units\n   - Item 2: 8 units\n   - Item 3: 7 units\n   - Item 4: 2 units\n   - Item 5: 6 units\n\n3. **Total Potential Value to Me:**\n   - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 71 = 284\n   - Item 2: 8 units \u00d7 4 = 32\n   - Item 3: 7 units \u00d7 54 = 378\n   - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n   - Item 5: 6 units \u00d7 6 = 36\n   - Total = 732\n\n4. **Outside Offer Value:** 701\n\nSince my outside offer is quite high (701 compared to the total potential value of 732), I should aim to secure a deal that values at least 701 or preferably closer to my total valuation (732) if possible, given the discount factor.\n\n5. **Negotiation Strategy:**\n   - Given the private valuation and the upcoming rounds with a discount (0.9^r-1 per round), I want to make an offer that maximizes my returns while leaving room for a potential agreement.\n   - Since I'm making the initial offer, I should ensure it's reasonable but advantageous for me, expecting there might be counteroffers or negotiations in the subsequent rounds.\n\nI will construct an initial offer by prioritizing items with lower value for me while aiming for a total deal value for me much higher than 701, bearing in mind I might need to adjust in future rounds:\n\n- **Offer Overview:** Reduce the number of high-value items I give away.\n  - Offer fewer of Item 1 and Item 3 which I value highly.\n  \n- **Initial Offer:**\n  - Item 1: Give 0 to Player 2\n  - Item 2: Give 6 to Player 2\n  - Item 3: Give 1 to Player 2\n  - Item 4: Give 1 to Player 2\n  - Item 5: Give 4 to Player 2\n\nThis structure gives me:\n- Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 71 = 284\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n- Item 3: 6 units \u00d7 54 = 324\n- Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 1 = 1\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 6 = 12\n- My total value from this offer would be 284 + 8 + 324 + 1 + 12 = 629\n\nI would adjust in the next round if necessary.

My outside offer is 1157. Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away *even before considering the discount factor*.\n\n2.  **Consider Future Rounds:** However, we are only in round 1. If I walk now, I get 1157. If I make a counteroffer, there's a chance we could reach a deal that gives me more than 1157 in value *after* discounting. So I should make a counter offer.\n\n3.  **What's a Reasonable Counteroffer?** I need to offer Player 1 enough to make them accept, but also retain as much value as possible for myself. Player 1 offered me [0, 6, 1, 1, 4].\n\n4.  **Determine Player 1 Value:**  I don't know Player 1's values, but I do know they made the initial offer. Player 1 offered me 0 of Item 1, so they must value Item 1 relatively highly. Similarly, they only offered me 1 of Item 3. They value Item 2 and 5 less. Let's try to give them more of items I value less and keep more of items I value more. I will propose that Player 1 takes almost all of Item 2 and Item 5, most of Item 1 and half of items 3 and 4. Let's try offering Player 1 [3, 7, 3, 1, 5].\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer (to Player 1):**\n\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 7\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 5\n\n**My Allocation (if Player 1 Accepts):**\n\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nMy Value if Player 1 Accepts:\n\n(1 * 58) + (1 * 6) + (4 * 56) + (1 * 77) + (1 * 69) = 58 + 6 + 224 + 77 + 69 = 434\n\n**Adjusted Strategy:**\n\nAs calculated before, my outside offer is 1157. The counter offer to Player 1 as calculated above leaves me with only 434, before taking into account gamma. This is simply not worth it, I must retain more value for myself.\n\nLet's try to give them more of items I value less and keep more of items I value more. My values are 58, 6, 56, 77, 69 for Items 1-5 respectively.\n\nI will try offer Player 1 [2, 7, 3, 1, 5]\n\n**My Allocation (if Player 1 Accepts):**\n\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nMy Value if Player 1 Accepts:\n\n(2 * 58) + (1 * 6) + (4 * 56) + (1 * 77) + (1 * 69) = 116 + 6 + 224 + 77 + 69 = 492\n\nThis still falls far short of my outside offer value of 1157. I need to retain considerably more value. I will revise my offer to [1, 7, 3, 1, 5]\n\n**My Allocation (if Player 1 Accepts):**\n\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nMy Value if Player 1 Accepts:\n\n(3 * 58) + (1 * 6) + (4 * 56) + (1 * 77) + (1 * 69) = 174 + 6 + 224 + 77 + 69 = 550\n\nThis still falls far short of my outside offer value of 1157. I need to retain considerably more value. I will revise my offer to [0, 7, 3, 1, 5]\n\n**My Allocation (if Player 1 Accepts):**\n\nItem 1: 4\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nMy Value if Player 1 Accepts:\n\n(4 * 58) + (1 * 6) + (4 * 56) + (1 * 77) + (1 * 69) = 232 + 6 + 224 + 77 + 69 = 608\n\nThis still falls far short of my outside offer value of 1157.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Player 1 will accept any offer that retains more value for me, and given the discount factor and the fact that it is the first round, I am much better off simply taking my outside option of 1157.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 2, and Player 1 has offered me [3, 4, 1, 1, 2] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My values for these items are 9, 29, 70, 98, and 31. My outside offer is 455. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(3 * 9) + (4 * 29) + (1 * 70) + (1 * 98) + (2 * 31) = 27 + 116 + 70 + 98 + 62 = 373\n\nSince the offer is worth 373 to me, and my outside offer is 455, I should not accept this offer as 373 < 455.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. To decide this, I need to consider what Player 1 might accept. I have 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5 in total. If I offer player 1 everything and they accepted, the value for myself would be 0 and I would be better off walking away. If I make a counter offer to player 1, the worst case scenario is the player walks away next round, so I need to make a counteroffer that nets me more than 455 * 0.9 = 409.5. Let me try to make an offer such that I can get at least this value.\n\nLet x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 denote the items I keep. The items that Player 1 gets is then (5-x1), (5-x2), (5-x3), (2-x4), (6-x5). Player 1 has values drawn from 1 to 101. Let's assume in the worst case, their values are relatively close to each other.\n\nMy value for keeping x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 is 9*x1 + 29*x2 + 70*x3 + 98*x4 + 31*x5. I want to make this value greater than 409.5.\nLet's try giving Player 1 only items 1 and 2 and a bit of item 5.\nOffer: [5, 5, 0, 0, 4]\nThen I keep: [0, 0, 5, 2, 2]\nMy value: 0 + 0 + 5*70 + 2*98 + 2*31 = 350 + 196 + 62 = 608.\n\nNow consider the other player. They get [5, 5, 0, 0, 4]. If they have the lowest possible values of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] for their values, their payoff is 5+5+4 = 14. Even if their values are 101, 101, 101, 101, their values are 505 + 505 + 404 = 1414. Since this is round 1, they need to get more than their outside offer scaled by 0.9. Let's suppose Player 1's outside offer is closer to 1400.\nI should be greedy and try to get more out of them.\nOffer [4, 4, 0, 0, 4]. Now I keep [1, 1, 5, 2, 2]. My value is 9 + 29 + 350 + 196 + 62 = 646.\nPlayer 1 receives [4, 4, 0, 0, 4]. Their value is 4*v1 + 4*v2 + 4*v5.\n\nLet's try offer [3, 3, 0, 0, 3]. I keep [2, 2, 5, 2, 3]. My value is 18 + 58 + 350 + 196 + 93 = 715 > 409.5.\nPlayer 1 receives [3, 3, 0, 0, 3]. Their value is 3*v1 + 3*v2 + 3*v5.\n\nLet's try an offer of [3, 3, 1, 0, 2]. Then I keep [2, 2, 4, 2, 4].

However, we're in round 1, and there's a good chance I can get a better deal.\n\nLet's consider what a good counteroffer would look like. I want to maximize my value. I have 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 6 units of item 5.

If I divide the items so they have almost nothing, they would likely walk, knowing their outside offer is in the same range as mine.\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that's attractive enough for Player 1 to accept but also significantly better than the current offer for me. It's a balance between getting more value and avoiding a walk.\n\nGiven the current offer and the potential for future rounds, walking away would be the sensible thing to do since my outside offer is a lot higher than the current offer. However, there are 2 more rounds. Perhaps I should make a counteroffer that is close to the actual value.\n\nI will try to get more of items 2 and 3, and give away the other items. So how about the offer: [3, 0, 0, 2, 3]. This means I keep 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3 and 1 unit of item 4.\nThe value to me would then be: (6 * 85) + (5 * 95) + (1 * 40) = 510 + 475 + 40 = 1025.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Calculate My Total Value Without a Deal:**\n   - My outside offer is worth 846. This is the value I receive if I decide to walk away and there is no deal.\n\n2. **Determine the Maximum Potential Value of Items:**\n   - Item 1: 6 units x 16 per unit = 96\n   - Item 2: 4 units x 46 per unit = 184\n   - Item 3: 6 units x 92 per unit = 552\n   - Item 4: 3 units x 69 per unit = 207\n   - Item 5: 3 units x 21 per unit = 63\n   - Total value = 1102\n\n3. **My Goal:**\n   - To achieve a value from the negotiation that exceeds my outside offer of 846.\n\n4. **Strategy for Initial Offer:**\n   - I want to give Player 2 a smaller value share of the total items while keeping the majority of high-value items for myself.\n   - Items are highly valued to me, particularly items 3 and 4. I need to secure as much of these as possible.\n\n5. **Drafting an Offer:**\n   - I'll offer Player 2 a portion of less valuable items while trying to retain those that are most valuable to me.\n   - Here is a reasonable starting offer:\n     - 3 units of item 1 to Player 2\n     - 2 units of item 2 to Player 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3 to Player 2\n     - 1 unit of item 4 to Player 2\n     - 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2\n\n6. **Calculate the Value of My Offer to Me If Player 2 Accepts:**\n   - Items I'll keep if they accept:\n     - Item 1: 3 units x 16 = 48\n     - Item 2: 2 units x 46 = 92\n     - Item 3: 5 units x 92 = 460\n     - Item 4: 2 units x 69 = 138\n     - Item 5: 2 units x 21 = 42\n   - Total value to me = 780\n\nSince the total value of 780 when multiplied by the discount factor of \u03b3^0 (since it's the first round) is 780, which is still below my outside offer. However, this is the initial round, and I am setting the stage for further negotiation rounds hoping for a counteroffer from Player 2 that could potentially increase my effective value above the outside offer after discounting in subsequent rounds.\n\nGiven these calculations and considerations, my action is to make an initial offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer on the table. Player 1 is offering me [3, 2, 1, 1, 1], meaning 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 50\n- Item 2: 98\n- Item 3: 24\n- Item 4: 70\n- Item 5: 80\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(3 * 50) + (2 * 98) + (1 * 24) + (1 * 70) + (1 * 80) = 150 + 196 + 24 + 70 + 80 = 520\n\nMy outside offer is 452.  Since 520 > 452, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *at this stage*. However, I need to consider the potential to get a better deal by making a counteroffer, factoring in the discount rate.\n\nIf I accept now, my value is 520. If I walk away, my value is 452.\n\nLet's consider the maximum possible value I could get. That would be if I got all the items: (6 * 50) + (4 * 98) + (6 * 24) + (3 * 70) + (3 * 80) = 300 + 392 + 144 + 210 + 240 = 1286\n\nNow, let's think about a reasonable counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I want to keep as much of items 2, 4 and 5 as possible. Player 1 has already offered a significant amount, so it is unlikely they will concede much more. I could try to push for a slightly better deal, perhaps giving them more of the less valuable items (from my perspective) in exchange.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I offer Player 1: [3, 1, 2, 1, 1].  This would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 4 units\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n(3 * 50) + (3 * 98) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 80) = 150 + 294 + 96 + 140 + 160 = 840\n\nThe discounted value of this at round 2 is 840 * 0.9 = 756\n\nSince 756 is significantly better than 520, and greater than my walkaway of 452, it is worth making a counteroffer. It's a riskier move than accepting right now, but the potential payoff is much higher.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [3, 1, 1, 0, 2] (3 units of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 2 of item 5).\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 50\n- Item 2: 98\n- Item 3: 24\n- Item 4: 70\n- Item 5: 80\n\nMy outside offer is 452.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(3 * 50) + (1 * 98) + (1 * 24) + (0 * 70) + (2 * 80) = 150 + 98 + 24 + 0 + 160 = 432\n\nSince it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of the current offer is 432 * 0.9 = 388.8\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 452. Therefore, I should either WALK or make a counteroffer that is worth at least 452 / 0.9 = 502.22 to me.\n\nLet's analyze my previous counteroffer in round 1. I offered Player 1 [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n- Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3\n- Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n- Item 3: 6 - 2 = 4\n- Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\nMy value for that offer would have been:\n(3 * 50) + (3 * 98) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 80) = 150 + 294 + 96 + 140 + 160 = 840.\nThe discounted value was 840*0.9^0 = 840.\n\nPlayer 1 is trying to get me to accept less value by the looks of their offer history.\nSince I have one round left after this round, I need to make a decision between walking and making a counteroffer that gives me a value of at least 502.22. \nLet's try an offer that gives Player 1 [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then, I would get [4, 4, 6, 3, 3]. The value of this to me is:\n(4 * 50) + (4 * 98) + (6 * 24) + (3 * 70) + (3 * 80) = 200 + 392 + 144 + 210 + 240 = 1186.\nDiscounted value = 1186*0.9 = 1067.4. This is much larger than 502.22\n\nLet's try an offer where Player 1 gets [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nI would then get [4, 3, 5, 2, 2]\n(4 * 50) + (3 * 98) + (5 * 24) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 80) = 200 + 294 + 120 + 140 + 160 = 914. \nDiscounted value = 914*0.9 = 822.6\n\nLet's try an offer where Player 1 gets [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nI would then get [3, 3, 4, 2, 2]\n(3 * 50) + (3 * 98) + (4 * 24) + (2 * 70) + (2 * 80) = 150 + 294 + 96 + 140 + 160 = 840. \nDiscounted value = 840*0.9 = 756\n\nThe only option I have is to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

This is my fallback value if negotiations break down, so any deal must be significantly better than this, factoring in the discount if the negotiation goes into further rounds.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Offer Strategy\nAs it's round 1 and there is no existing offer on the table, I will make the initial offer. I should aim to secure a high value for myself while making it acceptable to Player 2.\n\n#### Key Insights:\n1. **Item 5** is highly valuable to me (93 per unit), so I should try to keep all units of this item.\n2. **Item 4** is of low value to me (19 per unit), so I can offer all units of this to Player 2 to make the offer attractive.\n3. Distribute the remaining items to balance between keeping valuable items and incentivizing Player 2 to accept.\n\n#### Counteroffer Proposal:\n- Offer the entirety of low-value items and some of the mid-value ones:\n  - Item 1: Offer 1 unit (keeping 4 for myself)\n  - Item 2: Offer 1 unit (keeping 2 for myself)\n  - Item 3: Offer 3 units (keeping 4 for myself)\n  - Item 4: Offer all 3 units\n  - Item 5: Offer 1 unit (keeping 2 for myself)\n\n**My initial proposed offer to Player 2 is: [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]**\n\n### Step 4: Logistical Considerations\n- The offer maximizes my value while aiming to offer a reasonable portion to Player 2.\n- I aim for at least 70% of total items, adjusting for personal values.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]}\n```",

This means Player 1 is offering me:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   0 units of item 3\n*   2 units of item 4\n*   1 unit of item 5\n\n**Calculating the Value of the Offer to Me**\n\nMy private values are:\n\n*   Item 1: 24\n*   Item 2: 85\n*   Item 3: 21\n*   Item 4: 79\n*   Item 5: 53\n\nTherefore, the value of the offer to me is:\n\n(1 * 24) + (1 * 85) + (0 * 21) + (2 * 79) + (1 * 53) = 24 + 85 + 0 + 158 + 53 = 320\n\n**Considering the Discount Factor and Outside Option**\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So the present value of this offer is 320 * 1 = 320.\n\nMy outside option is 156. If I walk away, I get 156.\n\n**Evaluating a Counteroffer**\n\nTo determine if a counteroffer is better than accepting or walking away, I need to consider what I would need to offer Player 1 to make them accept and whether the remaining items for me are worth more than the offer on the table or my outside offer.\n\nThe total number of items are:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 2\n\nIf I accept the offer [1, 1, 0, 2, 1] I will get 320.\nI could give a counteroffer. In such a counteroffer I get:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\nThis would give me a payoff of 3 * 85 + 3 * 21 + 1 * 79 + 1 * 53 = 255 + 63 + 79 + 53 = 450.\nI would need to get Player 1 to accept the counteroffer.\nMy outside option is 156.\n\nBased on this, 320 > 156, so I am better off accepting than walking away.\n\n**Decision**\n\nThe offer on the table is worth 320, which is significantly more than my outside offer of 156. Attempting to make a counteroffer carries the risk of the negotiation breaking down and leaving me with only my outside option. Therefore, the best course of action is to accept the offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

The current offer is worth 367. Since 367 < 471, I would prefer to walk away right now rather than accept the current offer.\n\n**Reasoning about a Counteroffer:**\nI need to consider if there's a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept, that would be better than my outside offer. Since it's round 1, there are two more rounds where the value of any deal will be discounted by a factor of 0.9 (in round 2) or 0.81 (in round 3).\n\nTo determine what to offer, I need to estimate Player 1's values. However, I don't know their values. Given the time constraints and lack of information, the safest approach is to aim for something that is clearly better than my outside option, even if it is likely Player 1 will refuse this offer.\n\nLet's try to improve significantly over the 367 while not offering all of the items to Player 1.\n\n**My Plan:**\nSince the current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer and the deadline is near, I will try making a counteroffer that gets me closer to half the total value if it were all assigned to me (529 / 2 = approximately 264.5) added to the current offer value (367) or more for me. This gives value of 631.5, but I need to also consider the discount factors that will apply in the later rounds.\n\nGiven the situation, I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 less than what I was given, and therefore hopefully be able to reach a settlement.\n\n**Counteroffer:**\nI will offer Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\n**Value of the counteroffer to me:**\nI keep:\n* 2 units of Item 1 (value: 2 * 21 = 42)\n* 3 units of Item 2 (value: 3 * 10 = 30)\n* 2 units of Item 3 (value: 2 * 42 = 84)\n* 3 units of Item 4 (value: 3 * 84 = 252)\n* 6 units of Item 5 (value: 6 * 1 = 6)\n\nTotal Value = 42 + 30 + 84 + 252 + 6 = 414\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 471.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nI will WALK away from the negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I need to make an initial offer that allows me to achieve a value higher than my outside offer of 1044.\n2. The total value of all items is 1276, thus taking all items and ending with such a value is higher than the discounted outside offer.\n3. To win over my own outside offer, I need a share of items that provides me with a value over 1044.\n4. An appropriate strategy is to retain items that have a higher per-item value.\n\nTo maximize my gain consider the following high-value items first (rank based on their value to me):\n\n- Item 2: 99 per unit\n- Item 4: 91 per unit\n- Item 5: 76 per unit\n\nTo achieve at least a combined value higher than 1044, aim for a combination of mostly high-valued items:\n\n**Optimize Item Usage:**\n\n- Item 2 (4 items) contributes: \\(4 \\times 99 = 396\\)\n- Item 4 (2 items) contributes: \\(2 \\times 91 = 182\\)\n- Item 5 (6 items) contributes: \\(6 \\times 76 = 456\\)\n\nThis sum is \\( 396 + 182 + 456 = 1034\\).\n\nConsider adding some lower-valued items to get above 1044:\n\n- Item 1 (6 items): each worth 37.\n  \nIf I take 5 items of Item 1, it contributes an additional \\(5 \\times 37 = 185\\) resulting in a total of 1219, which clearly surpasses the outside offer.\n\nNow divide the offer:\n\nOffer Player 2 a share with value less than the combined total value (aim for adjusting the counter based on shared value insights, and limit maximum potential gain from lower valued items):\n\n1. I offer minimal items of high value to reach a fair share considering the need to ensure both feel they gain reasonable value reflecting that cooperative sharing is valuable during multiple rounds.\n\nThus, I'd offer 1 unit of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, 0 units of Item 5, ensuring that my offer is balanced yet achieves my bargains. \n\nThus a sensible first offer is to give away some low-value items while keeping high-value ones, enhancing mutual benefit.\n\n**My Counteroffer:**\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 6]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and Player 1 has offered me [1, 0, 1, 2, 6] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My values for these items are [2, 13, 14, 66, 13]. My outside offer is 230. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 2) + (0 * 13) + (1 * 14) + (2 * 66) + (6 * 13) = 2 + 0 + 14 + 132 + 78 = 226\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if I accept, walk, or counteroffer.\n\n*   **ACCEPT:** My value would be 226.\n*   **WALK:** My value would be 230.\n*   **COUNTEROFFER:** This is more complex. I need to consider what Player 1 might accept and how that compares to accepting now or walking.\n\nSince my outside offer is 230, and accepting the current offer yields 226, I should consider whether a counteroffer could lead to a better outcome. If I can get Player 1 to improve their offer in the next two rounds, even considering the discount factor, that might be better than walking away.\n\nHowever, the difference between my outside offer and the current offer's value is only 4 (230 - 226 = 4). Given the discount factor, I might not be able to gain enough from a counteroffer to make it worthwhile, especially considering the risk of Player 1 walking away.\n\nLet's be a bit more precise about the walkaway scenario. If I walk away, I get 230 immediately. If I accept, I get 226 immediately.\n\nA good starting point for a counteroffer is to ensure player 1 gets at least as much as they gave to me in the first round, according to my private values.\nPlayer 1 offered me [1, 0, 1, 2, 6]. The remaining items are [5, 4, 0, 0, 0]. Therefore I should try to give player 1 at least the equivalent of:\n5 * 2 + 4 * 13 = 10 + 52 = 62, or some more value.\n\nTo maximise my payout, I will offer the following to Player 1: [5, 4, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep [1, 0, 1, 2, 6], which gives me a value of 226.\n\nNow consider Player 1's value:\nWith values v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, he gets 5v1 + 4v2. We don't know this value.\n\nGiven the small difference between my outside offer and the current deal, and considering the simplicity of the game, I'll choose to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I will aim for close to my ideal split, while being mindful of the 3 round limit. If I am too greedy, then I risk them walking.\n\nLet's re-calculate the counteroffer now:\n\n*   Item 1: Give Player 1: 0, I keep 1 (69)\n*   Item 2: Give Player 1: 1, I keep 4 (308)\n*   Item 3: Give Player 1: 0, I keep 3 (282)\n*   Item 4: Give Player 1: 0, I keep 3 (210)\n*   Item 5: Give Player 1: 3, I keep 3 (126)\n\nTotal value of the counteroffer: 69 + 308 + 282 + 210 + 126 = 995.\n\n**Action:**\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]}\n",

With the discount factor, the present value of my outside option is 770 * 0.9 = 693.\n\nSince 315 < 693, I should not accept this offer. I need to decide whether to walk or to make a counteroffer. If I make a counteroffer now, since this is round 2, Player 1 can either accept or walk.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. I want to get at least my outside option value of 770 if the negotiation succeeds. I will use the discount factor to calculate what my minimum value should be if the deal closes this round: 770/0.9 = 855.56.\nIf I can make a counteroffer which gives me 855.56/0.9 = 950.62 value, I will take it. \n\nLet's think about possible offers. I currently have [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]. The total number of items is 1+5+3+3+6 = 18.\nPlayer 1 originally offered [0, 2, 0, 3, 2] and I countered with [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]. Player 1 is undervaluing item 3 and possibly overvaluing items 2 and 4. I need to give Player 1 at least something so they won't walk. I value item 3 the most. I will offer Player 1 3 units of item 3 and most of item 2 and 4 in return for the first item.\n\nI will offer Player 1 [1, 4, 3, 2, 0].\nThis leaves me with [0, 1, 0, 1, 6]. The value to me is:\n(0 * 69) + (1 * 77) + (0 * 94) + (1 * 70) + (6 * 42) = 0 + 77 + 0 + 70 + 252 = 399\nDiscounted, this is 399 * 0.9 = 359.1. Which is way below my outside option. This is a bad deal.\n\nI will offer player 1 [0, 4, 0, 3, 3]. This means I get [1, 1, 3, 0, 3]\nThe value is: (1 * 69) + (1 * 77) + (3 * 94) + (0 * 70) + (3 * 42) = 69 + 77 + 282 + 0 + 126 = 554\nDiscounted, this is 554*0.9 = 498.6, also still very bad.\n\nI need to secure more value now.

Since this is the first round, there is no discounting yet (gamma^0 = 1).\n\n4. **Value needed to surpass outside offer:** More than 327\n\n5. **Initial strategy:** As Player 1 in the first round, I have leverage to propose an offer that maximizes my value. I will make an offer that gives me the highest value, while still being attractive enough to avoid an early walk by Player 2. One approach is to propose small amounts of high-value items (to me) to ensure my value remains high.\n\n6. **Propose items to Player 2 that minimize my loss of value:**\n   - I will offer a lower number of my highest value items and more of those that have a relatively lower value.\n   - Sample offer:\n     - Item 1: Offer 1 unit\n     - Item 2: Offer 1 unit\n     - Item 3: Offer 3 units\n     - Item 4: Offer 1 unit\n     - Item 5: Offer 1 unit\n\n7. **Calculate the value to me if offer is accepted:**\n   - Item 1: 2 units * 7 = 14\n   - Item 2: 2 units * 25 = 50\n   - Item 3: 1 unit * 21 = 21\n   - Item 4: 3 units * 52 = 156\n   - Item 5: 5 units * 96 = 480\n\n   Total value to me = 14 + 50 + 21 + 156 + 480 = 721\n\nSince this value (721) is significantly greater than my outside offer (327), this offer is reasonable for the initial round.\n\n**Action:** \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's break down this negotiation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer from Player 1: [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]. This means they are offering me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 23\n- Item 2: 84\n- Item 3: 79\n- Item 4: 9\n- Item 5: 51\n\nSo, the value of this offer to me is:\n(1 * 23) + (1 * 84) + (3 * 79) + (1 * 9) + (1 * 51) = 23 + 84 + 237 + 9 + 51 = 404\n\nMy outside offer is 120. Since 404 > 120, accepting the offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1. I need to consider the possibility of getting a better deal by making a counteroffer. The discount factor is 0.9, which means that in round 2, the value of any deal will be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\nTo determine if a counteroffer is worthwhile, I need to think about what Player 1 might accept. They are offering me a deal that gives them:\n- Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n- Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n- Item 3: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n- Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n- Item 5: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n\nI don't know Player 1's values, so it's hard to guess what offer they might accept. But, I know that I have to give them *something* of value, so I can't just offer them nothing.\n\nLet's consider my ideal scenario - I get almost everything. I have:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 4 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 6 units\n\nSo the total possible value to me is: (3*23) + (3*84) + (4*79) + (4*9) + (6*51) = 69 + 252 + 316 + 36 + 306 = 979\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 404. This means Player 1 has a value of 979 - 404 = 575.\n\nLet's propose an alternative where I get a bit more. If I can get items that I value highly and Player 1 values less, I can get a better outcome. Let's say I take two units of item 2 instead of 1. Then my value from item 2 goes up by 84 and Player 1's goes down by some value, call it x. If 84 > x * 0.9, it's a good trade, and if 84 > x * 0.81, it's an even better trade. Since the possible values for items range from 1 to 101, I can assume a value of 50. If I do this, I should get a better overall outcome.\n\nLet's try offering them this:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 1\n\nThis means I would get:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 5 units\nThe value of this to me is:\n(2*23) + (3*84) + (3*79) + (3*9) + (5*51) = 46 + 252 + 237 + 27 + 255 = 817\n\nSo the value to Player 1 of this counteroffer is:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 1\n\nThis feels too greedy. Let's try something more reasonable. How about I offer Player 1: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]?\n\nThis would give me [2, 2, 2, 2, 3] which has value:\n(2*23) + (2*84) + (2*79) + (2*9) + (3*51) = 46 + 168 + 158 + 18 + 153 = 543\n\nOkay, this is a decent improvement from the current offer of 404. I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's Round 1, and Player 1 has offered me [1, 2, 4, 1, 1] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My private values are 73, 11, 89, 11, and 71 for items 1 through 5, and my outside offer is 479. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 73) + (2 * 11) + (4 * 89) + (1 * 11) + (1 * 71) = 73 + 22 + 356 + 11 + 71 = 533\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if I accept the offer. My value is 533.\n\nNext, let's think about walking away. If I walk, I get my outside offer of 479.\n\nFinally, let's consider making a counteroffer. This is the most complex option. In Round 2, Player 1 will have to make a decision given my counteroffer. The key is to think about what Player 1 values, even though I don't know their exact values.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the total units of each item:\nItem 1: 3 units\nItem 2: 4 units\nItem 3: 4 units\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 5 units\n\nThe offer to me is:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 2 units\nItem 3: 4 units\nItem 4: 1 unit\nItem 5: 1 unit\n\nTherefore, the offer to Player 1 is implicitly:\nItem 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\nItem 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\nItem 3: 4 - 4 = 0 units\nItem 4: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\nItem 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n\nTo make a good counteroffer, I should try to get more of the items I value highly (items 1, 3, and 5) while giving away more of the items I value less (items 2 and 4). However, I need to make sure Player 1 still gets enough to make it worthwhile for them to accept.\n\nSince it's round 1, there are still two more rounds of negotiation. This means I can afford to be a bit more aggressive in my counteroffer. Let's aim for an outcome that gives me a value slightly better than my outside offer, after considering the discount factor in subsequent rounds.\n\nI'm willing to risk walking away this round. Let's try offering the following to player 1:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 3\n\nThis means I would get:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 2\n\nMy value for this outcome is:\n(2 * 73) + (2 * 11) + (4 * 89) + (1 * 11) + (2 * 71) = 146 + 22 + 356 + 11 + 142 = 677\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 3]}\n```",

This means I get a slightly lower value if we delay the agreement.\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n\n*   (1 unit of item 1 * 1) + (1 unit of item 2 * 84) + (0 units of item 3 * 43) + (3 units of item 4 * 72) + (0 units of item 5 * 28) = 1 + 84 + 0 + 216 + 0 = 301\n\n**Considering My Options**\n\n1.  **Accept:** If I accept, I get a value of 301 immediately.\n2.  **Walk:** If I walk, I get my outside offer of 117 immediately.\n3.  **Counteroffer:** If I make a counteroffer, there are two possibilities:\n    *   Player 1 accepts: I get my value for the accepted offer, discounted by 0.9.\n    *   Player 1 rejects/walks: I get my outside offer of 117, discounted by 0.9.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n*   The current offer of 301 is significantly better than my outside option of 117.\n*   If I accept, I get 301 immediately. If I try to negotiate further, the best I can achieve is unlikely to be much more, and the worst case is getting 117*0.9 = 105.3 by the last round.\n*   Since the discount factor is 0.9, any offer I make now would have to yield a present value of significantly more than 301 to be worthwhile, and with only two rounds left, it's unlikely to be worth it.\n\n**Decision**\n\nGiven all the information, the best course of action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

The value of accepting the offer now is:\n331 * 0.9^(2-1) = 331 * 0.9 = 297.9\n\nMy outside offer is 451. So, accepting the current offer (297.9) is worse than walking away (451). Therefore, I should not accept the offer as it stands.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. We are in round 2. I need to make an offer that Player 1 might accept, considering they made the previous offer. To decide upon an appropriate counteroffer, I need to consider what's optimal in the final round, given I make a counteroffer now. If a counteroffer fails in round 2, the game ends and the agents take their outside options.\n\nIf I make a counteroffer in round 2 which is rejected, my payoff is my outside offer, which is 451. Therefore, the value of a deal in the final round should be greater than my outside offer, when discounted.\n\nLet's see if I can make a counteroffer that beats my outside option while also providing Player 1 more than they currently expect from walking away if they reject.\n\nCurrently, Player 1 is offering me [3, 2, 0, 2, 1]. This means Player 1 gets [8-3, 6-2, 0-0, 5-2, 2-1] = [5, 4, 0, 3, 1]. I don't know their values, so I can't make a judgment on how good this offer is for them.\n\nI want to get as close to my outside offer as possible and still have an accepted deal, so my counteroffer should give Player 1 as little value as possible, while still being something they will accept.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [4, 3, 0, 2, 1]. This gives me [4, 3, 0, 3, 1].\nMy value for this allocation is (4*33) + (3*98) + (0*21) + (3*6) + (1*24) = 132 + 294 + 0 + 18 + 24 = 468.\n\nThe discounted value of this in round 2 is 468 * 0.9 = 421.2. If that's rejected, then I get 451. If I accept the original offer, I get 297.9.\n\nSo instead of [4,3,0,2,1] I will try [4, 2, 0, 3, 1]. This gives me [4, 4, 0, 2, 1]. My value for this allocation is (4*33) + (4*98) + (0*21) + (2*6) + (1*24) = 132 + 392 + 0 + 12 + 24 = 560\nThe discounted value of this in round 2 is 560 * 0.9 = 504 > 451.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 0, 3, 1]}\n",

Since this is round 1, there is time to negotiate a better deal. Accepting this offer now would be a bad choice. I want to make a counteroffer where I get more items.\n\nLet's consider a fair division where each player obtains roughly equal value. My total value for all items is 1669. I would aim for at least half of that value, accounting for the discount factor in later rounds.\nIdeally, I would want to achieve something close to:\nValue for me >= 1085\n\nGiven the amounts, the best offer I could possibly hope to achieve (all items to myself) gives me 1669 value.\n\nNow, let's consider what I can offer to Player 1 to make them accept. Their values are unknown. If they have similar values to me, I would need to give them enough items to reach around their outside offer (which is unknown to me). Since I want to get more than my outside offer of 1085, I should aim for a split where they don't get that many valuable items from my perspective.\n\nI will make a counteroffer to give Player 1 [7, 7, 5, 2, 1].

Item 5 holds negligible value for me, and item 1, while high in per-unit value, only offers 71 in total due to being a single unit.\n\nAn ideal initial proposal should allow me to keep the majority of items 2, 3, and 4, offering minimal value to Player 2 in items that carry the least value for me.\n\nA reasonable first offer:\n\n- Offer all of Item 5 (6 units) to Player 2 since they hold a negligible value for me.\n- Offer the single unit of Item 1 to Player 2 as an additional element, releasing 71 in my side but potentially a high-value unit for Player 2.\n- Retain most of Items 2, 3, and 4 for higher retained value, given they constitute the bulk of my value.\n\nProposed offer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 6 units\n\nCounteroffer: \n- Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2 (offering entire unit)\n- Item 2: 0 units to Player 2 (keeping all)\n- Item 3: 0 units to Player 2 (keeping all)\n- Item 4: 0 units to Player 2 (keeping all)\n- Item 5: 6 units to Player 2 (offering all)\n\nThus, my action is: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 6]}\n```",

I need to figure out what would be a reasonable counteroffer that Player 1 might accept. Without knowing Player 1's values, this is difficult.\n\nIf I walk away, I get 1042. If I accept, I get 678. So, walking away is better than accepting.\n\nNow, let's try to make a counteroffer that's better for me than walking away but potentially acceptable to Player 1. I will aim for a value for myself just above my outside option of 1042, accounting for the discount factor of 0.9.  So I need 1042/0.9 = 1157.78. To be slightly safer I will aim to get 1160 worth of items.\n\nThe total value of all items to me is 1456. I will try to make an offer that gives a good portion of the items to myself while still giving Player 1 something.\n\nI have 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n\nThe current offer gives Player 1: 0 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 some item 2, item 3, and item 4. I need to keep the items I value most - item 1 and item 5.\nI propose to offer: 0 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n\nIf this is the offer to player 1:\nI keep: 1 unit of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\nMy value = 1*84 + 1*58 + 2*30 + 3*66 + 6*99 = 84 + 58 + 60 + 198 + 594 = 994\nThis is still less than my desired value. Lets try:\noffer: 0 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\nI keep: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\nMy value = 1*84 + 2*58 + 3*30 + 4*66 + 6*99 = 84 + 116 + 90 + 264 + 594 = 1148. This is pretty close, and after the discount factor 1148 * 0.9 = 1033, which is still below my outside option.\nSo I should still prefer to walk.\nHowever, since it is round 1, it might be beneficial to negotiate still.\nI will round down to my outside value to give the other player a good incentive. \n\nTherefore, I'm going to make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my outside offer and see how Player 1 responds.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 2, 0]}\n",

So Player 1 would get 1021 - 524 = 497\n\nNow let's construct an offer that would approximately give Player 1 the value 497.\nSince I don't know their value, I can not construct a perfectly reasonable offer to them.\n\nInstead, let's consider an offer such that I receive:\n* 0 of item 1\n* 0 of item 2\n* 1 of item 3\n* 0 of item 4\n* 0 of item 5\nThen I offer player 1:\n* 4 of item 1\n* 3 of item 2\n* 4 of item 3\n* 4 of item 4\n* 3 of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with 1 * 73 = 73. This is significantly less than my outside value of 524. Thus this offer would not be a smart decision.\n\nLet's consider the midpoint of the value, 1021 / 2 = 510.5. I could counteroffer close to that.\n\nIf I could ensure that Player 1 would accept my next offer, then the value for me would be:\n0.9 * Value\nTo beat my outside option, I must secure at least 524 / 0.9 = 582.22 of value for myself.\n\nThis indicates I should make a counteroffer. I will make a counteroffer that favors me only slightly, to ensure the highest possible acceptance.\n\nLet's consider the following split:\n* Item 1: Player 1 = 1, Player 2 = 3\n* Item 2: Player 1 = 1, Player 2 = 2\n* Item 3: Player 1 = 2, Player 2 = 3\n* Item 4: Player 1 = 1, Player 2 = 3\n* Item 5: Player 1 = 1, Player 2 = 2\n\nThis corresponds to the offer [1, 1, 2, 1, 1].\n\nMy value: (3 * 76) + (2 * 29) + (3 * 73) + (3 * 7) + (2 * 79) = 228 + 58 + 219 + 21 + 158 = 684\n\nLet me make that offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

Total value = 1062\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 161\n*   **Opponent's Offer:** [1, 0, 4, 0, 2] (This is what *I* receive)\n*   **Discount Factor:** 0.9\n*   **Round:** 2\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer**\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 41 = 41\n*   0 units of item 2: 0 * 43 = 0\n*   4 units of item 3: 4 * 76 = 304\n*   0 units of item 4: 0 * 36 = 0\n*   2 units of item 5: 2 * 91 = 182\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 41 + 0 + 304 + 0 + 182 = 527\n\nConsidering the discount factor for Round 2 (0.9^(2-1) = 0.9), the present value of accepting this offer is 527 * 0.9 = 474.3\n\n**Considering Alternatives**\n\n*   **WALK:**  I would receive my outside offer of 161.\n*   **COUNTEROFFER:** I need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer might be, and whether it's likely to be accepted in the final round. If a counteroffer is not accepted, I get my outside offer of 161 * 0.9 = 144.9.\n\n**Developing a Counteroffer Strategy**\n\nLet's figure out what I would need to offer Player 1 to make them indifferent between accepting my counteroffer and walking away. First, we need to figure out how much Player 1 values the existing resources:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n*   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n*   Item 3: 7 - 4 = 3\n*   Item 4: 0 - 0 = 0\n*   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nThese are the remaining units of each item, which is what Player 1 would receive if I accepted the offer. In order to make Player 1 indifferent between accepting a counteroffer and the current offer, I would need to create a counteroffer that offers a similar amount of value (at least 474.3/0.9 = 527).\n\n**Comparison**\n*   If I accept, my payoff is 474.3.\n*   If I walk, my payoff is 161.\n*   My outside option, even discounted, is considerably lower than the current offer. Let us proceed by making a reasonable counteroffer.\n\nTo construct a good counteroffer, I should aim to keep the items I value most, namely item 5 and item 3.\n\nHere is my proposal:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 to Player 1\n*   Item 2: 1 to Player 1\n*   Item 3: 4 to Player 1\n*   Item 4: 0 to Player 1\n*   Item 5: 2 to Player 1\n\nThis means I would receive:\n\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 0\n*   Item 3: 3\n*   Item 4: 0\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nMy value: 1*41 + 0*43 + 3*76 + 0*36 + 2*91 = 41 + 0 + 228 + 0 + 182 = 451\nMy discounted value = 451 * 0.9 = 405.9\n\nI'd be walking away in the final round if this wasn't accepted. This value is still higher than my outside option after discounts.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 0, 2]}\n```",

So the present value of the current offer to me is 311 * 1 = 311.\n\n**Strategic Thinking**\n\nHere's my reasoning for deciding on an action:\n\n1.  **Compare to Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 743. The current offer of 311 is significantly less than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting is not a good option at this point.\n2.  **Last Round Consideration:** This isn't the last round, so I don't have to make a decision immediately.\n3.  **Counteroffer Strategy:** I need to consider what kind of counteroffer might be accepted by Player 1. My goal is to get something better than 311, ideally closer to my outside offer, while also ensuring player 1 gets enough to not walk away. I should offer Player 1 an allocation that is at least as good as their outside option.\n4.  **Estimate Player 1's Values:** Since I don't know Player 1's values, I can't calculate exactly what they would value any counteroffer.\n5.  **Initial Counteroffer:** Given this is Round 1, and I don't want to push player 1 into walking away, I will make a counteroffer that is somewhat more favorable to me than the current offer. I will give slightly more of items that I value less and keep slightly more of items I value more.\n\n**Constructing a Counteroffer**\n\nHere's the counteroffer I'll create:\nI am currently getting: 1, 0, 1, 1, 3\nTotal items: 4, 3, 4, 3, 5\n\nI am offering player 1: 3, 1, 3, 2, 2\nThis leaves me with: 1, 2, 1, 1, 3\n\nValue of my holdings: 1 * 27 + 2 * 75 + 1 * 41 + 1 * 78 + 3 * 55 = 27 + 150 + 41 + 78 + 165 = 461\n\n**Decision**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside option and this isn't the last round, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 3, 2, 2]}\n```",

To increase the value of the deal to approach or surpass my outside offer, I would need to gain a significantly larger number of high-value items, primarily item 2.\n\nGiven the round and the valuation, walking away is currently more favorable unless there is a significant possibility that the opponent would accept a counter that maximizes my higher-value items, which is uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to walk away, as the current value presented does not meet my threshold.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Compare the offer to my outside option:**\n\nMy outside option is 156. The current offer (510) is significantly better than my outside option.\n\n**3. Consider the possibility of a better counteroffer:**\n\nSince this is round 1, there are two more rounds of negotiation. I need to consider if I can realistically get a better offer by making a counteroffer. The maximum I can achieve is a total negotiation value of 1168, my total value for all items. My current offer only gives me 510.\n\nIf I accept the offer, I will get a discounted value of 510 if the round is 1, 510 * 0.9 if round 2, 510 * 0.81 if round 3.\n\nIf I walk, I will get a discounted value of 156 if the round is 1, 156 * 0.9 if round 2, 156 * 0.81 if round 3.\n\nIt is most beneficial to accept a round 1 offer if it is above my outside offer.\n\n**4. Determine the optimal action:**\n\nThe current offer of 510 is significantly better than my outside offer of 156. Given that it is Round 1, there is a good opportunity to get more out of this negotiation.\n\nI can't know the other player's values, so it's difficult to make a perfect counter offer.\n\nHowever, if I accept the current offer, I will have a payoff of 510.\nIf I walk away, I will have a payoff of 156.\n\nSince it's round 1, I will try to make a counter offer that favors me more. I will try to get more of item 2 and item 5. I will offer player 1 [1, 0, 2, 3, 0].\nThis gives them 18 + 0 + 140 + 204 + 0 = 362\n\nI have to get at least 156 for the offer to be better than walking away from negotiation. \n\nI want to offer a counteroffer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 3, 0]}\n```",

We have 3 rounds, so this is a good chance to make a serious counteroffer:\n\n- Prioritize my most valued items: item 4 (88 value) and item 2 (78 value)\n- Offer fewer of these to keep a high total value.

My outside offer is 156, discounted by one round, it would be 156. Therefore, I need to get at least 156 value this round. \n\nThe current offer gives me a discounted value of 397.8. Walking away would give me 156.\n\nSince this is round 2, I have to either accept, walk, or make a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept. Let's think about a good counteroffer strategy. It has to be better than the current offer, and it should also be better than walking away.\n\nLet's say I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 3, 1].\nThen I would get:\nitem 1: 2 - 1 = 1\nitem 2: 3 - 1 = 2\nitem 3: 4 - 1 = 3\nitem 4: 6 - 3 = 3\nitem 5: 3 - 1 = 2\nValue to me: (1 * 18) + (2 * 78) + (3 * 70) + (3 * 68) + (2 * 70) = 18 + 156 + 210 + 204 + 140 = 728\nDiscounted value: 728 * 0.9 = 655.2\n\nNow, considering Player 1, they would get [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]\nLet's say their values are all 50. (This is just for an example).\nThen their value would be 50 + 50 + 50 + 150 + 50 = 350\n\nUnder Player 1's initial counteroffer to me of [1, 1, 2, 2, 1], they received [1, 2, 2, 4, 2]. With values of all 50, they receive 50 + 100 + 100 + 200 + 100 = 550.\n\nSo, offering them [1, 1, 1, 3, 1] might not be acceptable.\n\nLet's try to focus on the items I value most: item 2, 3, 4 and 5.\n\nI am currently getting [1, 1, 2, 2, 1].\n\nGiven the limited number of rounds, the best strategy is probably to accept if the discounted value exceeds the outside offer.\n\nSince 397.8 > 156, I should accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

An effective strategy is to offer Player 2 less valuable items from my perspective while retaining more valuable ones.

My goal is to get a deal that's better than my outside offer, taking into account the discount factor in later rounds. If I can get a deal that's worth more than 636/0.9 = 706.67 (approximately) to me in round 2, or more than 636/0.9^2 = 785.19 (approximately) to me now, then it might be worth pursuing a deal.\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that Player 1 is likely to accept, while still giving me a good deal. Let's start by aiming for a split that gives me roughly my outside offer *in present value*. I want Player 1 to think that I'll walk if I don't get an offer that has a final value to me of around 636/0.9 = 707 in future rounds, or 636 in round 1.\n\nA reasonable approach is to demand at least half of each item and aim for a value above 636.

In that case, I get all the items. My total value is 891. I should offer just enough to get Player 1 above their outside option in the next round when considering their discount factor.

The discounted value of accepting the current offer, 451.8, is significantly higher than walking away with the outside offer, which is 31.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Counteroffer\nTo increase my potential share without risking a walk from player 2, I'll consider offering slightly less to Player 2 and seeing if they accept, maximizing my score without reaching their potential outside offer value.\n\n#### My Initial Offer was [0, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n- Total units given to Player 2 = 1 (item 2) + 1 (item 3) + 1 (item 4) + 3 (item 5) = 6\n\n#### Player 2's Offer to Me was [0, 0, 0, 1, 5]\n- Total units given to me = 1 (item 4) + 5 (item 5) = 6\n\nSince we have equal total items exchanged, I can suggest an almost similar distribution but push for slightly more of the high-value item 5 due to its significance to me.\n\n### Counteroffer Suggestion:\n- Reduce the offer of item 5 to Player 2, attempt to gain +1 additional item 5 for myself. Here is the proposed distribution:\n  - Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 1, 1, 4]\n  - Meaning I get: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3] (because total available units minus those offered to Player 2).\n\nThus, I'll make a counteroffer to ensure I gain more high-valued items while keeping the offer attractive:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 4]}\n```",

I need to retain a combination of items that gives me a value greater than 734.\n2. If I offer some items to Player 2, the remaining items should have sufficient value for me.\n\nConsider making an offer where I keep the higher-valued items (with more weight on items that have a value per unit above the average value per unit = total value / total number of items = 930 / 15 = 62):\n\n- Offer Player 2 the lower-valued items (item 2 and item 4) while keeping item 3, item 5, and possibly some of item 1 for myself.\n\nLet's calculate the split if I propose:\n- Giving Player 2: all 6 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 1.\n\nThe remaining items for me would be: \n- 2 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\nCalculate the value for me:\n- My value from remaining items = (2 \\times 98) + (0 \\times 46) + (2 \\times 58) + (0 \\times 25) + (3 \\times 73) = 196 + 0 + 116 + 0 + 219 = 531.\n\nThe value of this potential offer for Player 2 would be:\n- Player 2 value from given items = (1 \\times 98) + (6 \\times 46) + (1 \\times 25) = 98 + 276 + 25 = 399.\n\nHowever, my value with this offer would be 531, which is less than my outside offer of 734. I need to adjust this to get a better deal.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n- Offer Player 2 only some lower-valued items, specifically keeping more from item 5, which is quite valuable to me.\n\nLet's try a better combination:\n- Offering Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\nThe remaining items for me would be:\n- 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\nRecalculate the value for me:\n- My value = (3 \\times 98) + (3 \\times 46) + (2 \\times 58) + (1 \\times 25) + (2 \\times 73)\n- My value = 294 + 138 + 116 + 25 + 146 = 719.\n\nThis is still slightly under 734, but it is a good starting point attempting maximization without crossing into an unfavorable threshold.\n\nThis calculation suggests, let's maximizing for me further:\n- Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 for initial balance exploration.\n\nFinally on inspecting distribution:\n- Keep entire item 1 for maximizing retention, adjust minimal influence lower values, balance item 5 one return on potential good offer.\n\nRecalculate:\n\n- Given Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n- Keep: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\nFinal compute for self:\n- My retained value = (3 \\times 98) + (2 \\times 46) + (2 \\times 58) + (1 \\times 25) + (2 \\times 73)\n- Value for action = 294 + 92 + 116 + 25 + 146 = 673.\n\nThis offer would quite surely match balancing critical point - optimum initial workable and max insight rational.\n\nBetter retain fundamentally promote ability accept less aggressive: \n\nLet's finalize strategy handing potential, could demonstrate stronger retention:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 0, 1]}",

This isn't great on its own, but with the potential for further negotiation, it's a starting point.\n\nHowever, I need to consider Player 1's perspective, which I do not know. I need to make a reasonable offer to start negotiations. It is better to walk away than accept 225, but I want to try to get something better.\n\nA counteroffer of [3, 0, 2, 1, 0] would give me a value of 435 * 0.9 = 391.5 in the second round if they accepted.

Since we're in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9. Thus, the adjusted value of the current offer to me is:\n- Adjusted Value = 294 x 0.9 = 264.6\n\n### Outside Offer Evaluation\n- My outside offer is 734.\n\n### Comparison\n- Adjusted value of the current offer (264.6) is much less than my outside offer (734).\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\nGiven that I value item 1 highly, but also want a higher overall value closer to or exceeding 734 after factoring in the discount, I should propose a counteroffer that increases my overall value significantly. The goal is to obtain much more value than the current offer.\n\n**Counteroffer Rationale:**\n- I aim to get most of item 1 (due to high value), along with some units of the other items, especially items with high value per unit like item 5.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer:\n\n**Counteroffer Offer to Player 2:**\n- Give Player 2: [0, 4, 0, 0, 2]\n- This means I propose keeping all of items 1 and 5, and offering a significant portion of available item 2 to Player 2.\n- I keep [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\n**Value of My Counteroffer:**\n- Item 1: 3 x 98 = 294\n- Item 2: 2 x 46 = 92\n- Item 3: 2 x 58 = 116\n- Item 4: 1 x 25 = 25\n- Item 5: 1 x 73 = 73\n- Total Value = 600\n\nAdjusted value (in round 2 with gamma = 0.9):\n- Adjusted Value = 600 x 0.9 = 540\n\nThe adjusted value of my counteroffer (540) is below my outside offer but significantly higher now.

The offer is [0, 2, 2, 1, 1], meaning I get 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy values are: 79 for item 1, 56 for item 2, 67 for item 3, 99 for item 4, 32 for item 5.\n\nSo, the value of the offer to me is: (0 * 79) + (2 * 56) + (2 * 67) + (1 * 99) + (1 * 32) = 0 + 112 + 134 + 99 + 32 = 377.\n\nMy outside offer is 321. Since 377 > 321, accepting the offer is better than walking away *in this round*.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1. I need to consider the potential benefit of making a counteroffer, considering the discount factor of 0.9.\n\nIf I accept now, I get 377. If I make a counteroffer and reach an agreement in round 2, the value will be multiplied by 0.9. If the deal happens in round 3, the value will be multiplied by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\nTo decide whether to counteroffer, I need to estimate the maximum value Player 1 could be getting and how much I could potentially improve my offer. I don't know Player 1's values, but I can assume they are trying to maximize their own utility. Let's assume for a moment that Player 1 has the highest possible value for all items (101).  With the current offer of [0, 2, 2, 1, 1] to *me*, Player 1 has the allocation [4, 6, 2, 1, 3]. This would be a high possible valuation for Player 1.\n\nThe total value of the items is (4 * 79) + (8 * 56) + (4 * 67) + (2 * 99) + (4 * 32) = 316 + 448 + 268 + 198 + 128 = 1358.\nSince Player 1 offered me [0, 2, 2, 1, 1], they keep [4, 6, 2, 1, 3]. I can make them a counter offer.\n\nLet's consider a counter offer where I get a larger share of item 4 (which I value highly), and potentially concede some of item 2 or item 5, which I value lower. I also want to offer Player 1 a deal that they're better off accepting than their outside offer.

My outside offer is 445.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 1's offer to me:\n(1 * 88) + (2 * 69) + (2 * 93) + (1 * 27) + (2 * 89) = 88 + 138 + 186 + 27 + 178 = 617\n\nSince 617 > 445, accepting the offer is better than walking away right now.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer.

However, I can try to make a counteroffer that gives me a larger share of the items I value more highly.\n\nSince it's the first round, I have some leverage. I could try offering Player 1 a deal that's slightly better than my outside offer, hoping they accept. However, I'll start with a slight adjustment to the current deal.\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer. I'll slightly lower my item 3 and increase item 2.\nCounteroffer: [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]\nThe value of Player 1's offer to me with the new counteroffer:\n(1 * 88) + (3 * 69) + (1 * 93) + (1 * 27) + (2 * 89) = 88 + 207 + 93 + 27 + 178 = 593\n\nWith this counteroffer, Player 1 would receive:\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 2\n\nSince 617 > 593, this counteroffer isn't better than accepting, and could lead to a worse outcome.\n\nLet's try offering just my outside option, with some items being rounded.

Accepting this deal is not favorable.\n\n### Plan for Counteroffer\nI need to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my return and reasonably encourages Player 2 to accept.

My counteroffer should aim to achieve a total value greater than my outside offer or try to approach it as much as possible given the constraints.\n\n#### Consideration for Counteroffer\nLet's aim to keep high-value items for myself, like Item 3 and Item 5, and offer more of lower value items (from my perspective) to Player 2 to increase their appeal.\n\nI will offer:\n- 3 units of Item 1\n- 2 units of Item 2\n- 0 units of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 2 units of Item 5\n\n**Reasoning for Counteroffer:**\n- By offering more of Item 1, which is less valuable to me, and aiming to keep all of Item 3, I maximize my retained value.\n- Offering 2 of Item 5 retains some balance, as keeping more similar units won't reach my needed threshold alone.\n\nThe remaining units for myself:\n- Item 1: 3 (Value: 45)\n- Item 2: 5 (Value: 110)\n- Item 3: 5 (Value: 420)\n- Item 4: 2 (Value: 100)\n- Item 5: 2 (Value: 110)\n\nTotal value of units I would keep: \\(45 + 110 + 420 + 100 + 110 = 785\\)\n\nDiscounted value = 785 (as it's planned for only a potential round 3 discussion if needed).\n\nA counteroffer ensuring my maximum benefit attempting near my outside offer.

Since this is round 2, the discount is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n*   Discounted Value of current offer: 580 * 0.9 = 522\n\nSince my outside offer is 445, the current offer is better than walking away.\n\nNow, let's analyze the previous offers and available quantities to see if a better counteroffer might be possible. I initially offered [2, 2, 1, 0, 1] to Player 1. They responded offering me [3, 2, 0, 0, 2]. This indicates that they value item 3. Let's try and get more of item 3. I have 5 units of item 3.\n\nTo determine a potential counteroffer, let's calculate the maximum value I can give away without going below my outside option: I need to retain at least 445/0.9 = 494.44 value.\nMy total value is 1886. I am currently getting value 580 and giving value of: (6-3)*88 + (7-2)*69 + (5-0)*93 + (2-0)*27 + (4-2)*89 = 264 + 345 + 465 + 54 + 178 = 1306\nThe current split is not equitable.\n\nLet's aim for an offer slightly better than my outside option for me and better than their current offer for them. I will try to improve my position on item 3. I will offer them [3, 3, 0, 1, 2]. This gives me value 3*88 + 4*69 + 5*93 + 1*27 + 2*89 = 264 + 276 + 465 + 27 + 178 = 1210.

If I walk away, my value is 163. So, accepting is currently much better than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer.  I need to give Player 1 enough to make them prefer my counteroffer to walking away or any future offers they might expect. Since this is round 1, there are two more rounds of potential negotiation, so Player 1 might expect to get something better later.\n\nI want to figure out if I can propose an offer that gives me more than 769 while still being attractive enough for Player 1 to accept.  It's difficult to know Player 1's values, but a fair starting point is to aim for an equal split of the total value, or perhaps slightly in my favor, considering I'm Player 2.\nThe total number of items are 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. I have a rough idea of my valuations, let's make a reasonable offer.

Therefore, walking away is not a good option at this point.\n\n2.  **Consider the future:** This is round 1, so there are two more rounds of negotiation. The discount factor is 0.9. If I make a counteroffer, Player 1 might accept it, or they might make another offer in round 2, and so on.\n\n3.  **Develop a counteroffer strategy:** I need to decide what a reasonable counteroffer would be. I want to improve my payoff without being too greedy and risking a walkaway in future rounds. The goal here is to increase my overall expected value by the end of round 3, while accounting for the discount factor. A good starting point is to determine what would provide me a value that's better than 210 * 0.9 or better.\n\nLet's consider a scenario where I get:\n* Item 1: 0 units\n* Item 2: 1 units\n* Item 3: 1 units\n* Item 4: 0 units\n* Item 5: 6 units\n\nValue of that scenario: 0 + 2 + 71 + 0 + 60 = 133. This is far less than the 210 being offered.\n\nLet's consider a scenario where I get:\n* Item 1: 0 units\n* Item 2: 1 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 4 units\n\nValue of that scenario: 0 + 2 + 142 + 44 + 40 = 228\n\nThis scenario could be represented in a counteroffer like this:\n[2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\nLet's think about this offer from Player 1's perspective. They are getting:\n* Item 1: 2 units\n* Item 2: 1 units\n* Item 3: 0 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 4 units\n\nI think it might be beneficial to try to get more of Item 3 because my valuation for this item is high. Let's craft an alternative offer where I get:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 2\n* Item 4: 1\n* Item 5: 4\n\nThis leads to the following counteroffer:\n[2, 3, 0, 2, 2]\n\nLet's consider a valuation of this offer:\n0 + 0 + 142 + 22 + 40 = 204. If accepted, this would be lower than the 210 currently on the table.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the current offer is better than the outside offer, and considering the potential to gain in the future rounds, I will try to secure more value by proposing a more favorable deal. I'll aim for getting all the Item 3's since that is my highest-valued item. The most reasonable option for the first counteroffer is therefore:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 2, 2]}\n",

Additionally, I need to consider the potential impact of the discount factor if the negotiation proceeds to further rounds.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my values:\n\n- Item 1: Value = 26, Units = 2, Total Value = 26 * 2 = 52\n- Item 2: Value = 49, Units = 4, Total Value = 49 * 4 = 196\n- Item 3: Value = 26, Units = 2, Total Value = 26 * 2 = 52\n- Item 4: Value = 9, Units = 5, Total Value = 9 * 5 = 45\n- Item 5: Value = 6, Units = 6, Total Value = 6 * 6 = 36\n\nTotal potential value = 52 + 196 + 52 + 45 + 36 = 381\n\nSince my total potential value is 381, and I receive 65 if I walk away, this means any offer that gives me less than 65 is worse than walking away, especially considering the discounting factor if it goes to future rounds.\n\nIn making a counteroffer, I'll aim to maximize the value I retain while making a plausible offer. A strategy is to test an offer where I retain high-value items or portions and see if Player 2 counters or accepts.\n\nI propose to give some units of each item to Player 2 but retain enough value on the overall distribution.\n\nHere is one possible offer distribution, balancing giving some items and retaining enough value to exceed my outside offer:\n\n- Item 1: Give 1 unit (I keep 1)\n- Item 2: Give 2 units (I keep 2)\n- Item 3: Give 1 unit (I keep 1)\n- Item 4: Give 2 units (I keep 3)\n- Item 5: Give 3 units (I keep 3)\n\nThis allocation allows me to retain significant portions of items with higher values. Let's calculate my retained value in this situation:\n\n- Item 1: 1 * 26 = 26\n- Item 2: 2 * 49 = 98\n- Item 3: 1 * 26 = 26\n- Item 4: 3 * 9 = 27\n- Item 5: 3 * 6 = 18\n\nTotal value retained = 26 + 98 + 26 + 27 + 18 = 195\n\nMy proposed offer allows me to retain 195 from the total value, which is significantly higher than the 65 from my outside offer, ensuring that I gain more through negotiation.\n\nBased on the considerations above, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]}",

My values for these items are 51, 93, 84, 24, and 100. My outside offer is 1155, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(2 * 51) + (1 * 93) + (1 * 84) + (1 * 24) + (3 * 100) = 102 + 93 + 84 + 24 + 300 = 603\n\nNow, let's consider what would be left for Player 1 if I accept. The total amounts of each item are 8, 2, 2, 3, and 6. So, Player 1 would receive:\nItem 1: 8 - 2 = 6\nItem 2: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 3: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 4: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 5: 6 - 3 = 3\n\nI don't know Player 1's values, so I can't estimate their payoff. However, I can see if accepting is better than walking away. Accepting gives me 603. Walking away gives me 1155. So walking away is better right now if I only consider the current round. But, the opportunity to get more value exists if a counteroffer is made.\n\nLet's think about a counteroffer. I want to find a deal where my payoff is significantly higher than 603. Let's consider giving Player 1 almost everything. For example, an offer of [6, 1, 1, 2, 3] to Player 1, meaning they get most of everything. This would give me:\nItem 1: 8 - 6 = 2\nItem 2: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 3: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 4: 3 - 2 = 1\nItem 5: 6 - 3 = 3\n\nMy value in this scenario would be (2 * 51) + (1 * 93) + (1 * 84) + (1 * 24) + (3 * 100) = 102 + 93 + 84 + 24 + 300 = 603. But there is no reason to accept this for player 1 since it mirrors the first offer!\n\nI need to make a more aggressive offer, accounting for the discount factor. My outside offer is 1155. In round 2, that value becomes 1155 * 0.9 = 1039.5. In round 3 it becomes 1155 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 935.55.\n\nI need an offer that gives me significantly more than my current offer value of 603 while also considering the potential gain of a higher offer given the discount factor. Let me try to offer them [3, 0, 0, 0, 0].  This leaves me with:\nItem 1: 8 - 3 = 5\nItem 2: 2 - 0 = 2\nItem 3: 2 - 0 = 2\nItem 4: 3 - 0 = 3\nItem 5: 6 - 0 = 6\n\nMy value would be: (5 * 51) + (2 * 93) + (2 * 84) + (3 * 24) + (6 * 100) = 255 + 186 + 168 + 72 + 600 = 1281\n\nThis is far better than my current offer.\n\nNow let's compare this to my discounted outside offer. 1281 > 1155 * 0.9 * 0.9 or 935.55. But should I make the offer now, or later? Let's wait until round 2 and see if player 1 makes a better deal.\n\nTherefore, my optimal action is to counteroffer with [3, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 has just made an offer of [4, 1, 1, 1, 3]. This means they are offering me 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy values are: 51 for item 1, 93 for item 2, 84 for item 3, 24 for item 4, 100 for item 5.\nSo, the value of this offer to me is:\n(4 * 51) + (1 * 93) + (1 * 84) + (1 * 24) + (3 * 100) = 204 + 93 + 84 + 24 + 300 = 705.\n\nSince it is round 2, this value must be discounted by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of the offer is 705 * 0.9 = 634.5.\n\nMy outside offer is 1155.\nIf I walk away, I get 1155.\nTherefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away at this point.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I need to offer something that Player 1 might accept, which also gives me a value greater than my outside offer when discounted.\n\nLet's try to find an offer that gives Player 1 at least as much value as their current offer gives me.\nPlayer 1 is currently getting 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Since their values are between 1 and 101, it's hard to estimate the value of this offer to them. I can only try and see.\n\nI need to decide if a counteroffer is worth it, compared to walking away. In the final round (round 3), if I counteroffer, it is equivalent to walking away. Thus, if I were in round 3, and my outside offer was larger than the offer on the table, I would walk. I'm in round 2 now, so I need to compare a possible counteroffer with the outside offer, taking into account the discount factor.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that is slightly better than my current offer to Player 1. I currently offered [3, 0, 0, 0, 0] initially. Let me modify this to [3, 0, 0, 0, 1].\nThis means I keep 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\nValue to me: (5*51) + (2*93) + (2*84) + (3*24) + (5*100) = 255 + 186 + 168 + 72 + 500 = 1181\nDiscounted value: 1181 * 0.9 = 1062.9\nThis is worse than my outside offer of 1155.\n\nLet's try a different counteroffer. I'll aim for a value near my outside offer. If I offered Player 1 all of item 1 and item 5, and kept the rest, my value would be:\n(0 * 51) + (2 * 93) + (2 * 84) + (3 * 24) + (0 * 100) = 0 + 186 + 168 + 72 + 0 = 426\nThis would not be a good outcome.\nIt's becoming clear that achieving an offer greater than my outside offer is difficult, given the limited number of rounds and the discount factor. Therefore, the best strategy is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

The current offer (620) is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n**Considering Future Rounds**\n\nIf I reject the offer, we move to Round 2, and the values are discounted by a factor of 0.9.  The maximum I could possibly achieve is my total valuation of all the items, which is 1383. In round 2, the maximum discounted value would be 1383 * 0.9 = 1244.7.\n\n**Strategic Decision**\n\nSince the current offer is already much better than my outside option, and there is no guarantee I will get anything better in future rounds, I should accept the offer. Even if I were to get my maximum possible value, the most that offer could improve by accepting now versus accepting then is 1244.7 - 620 = 624.7. Given that I have a very large value, Player 1 likely has a similar value and would not offer much more than the current offer.

This means Player 1 is offering me:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   3 units of item 3\n*   1 unit of item 4\n*   1 unit of item 5\n\n**Calculating the Value of the Current Offer:**\n\nLet's calculate the value of this offer based on my private values:\n\n*   Item 1: 1 unit * 79 = 79\n*   Item 2: 1 unit * 91 = 91\n*   Item 3: 3 units * 98 = 294\n*   Item 4: 1 unit * 11 = 11\n*   Item 5: 1 unit * 87 = 87\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 79 + 91 + 294 + 11 + 87 = 562\n\n**Considering the Discount Factor:**\n\nSince it's round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.  Therefore, the present value of accepting this offer is 562 * 1 = 562.\n\n**Comparing with the Outside Offer:**\n\nMy outside offer is 353. Accepting the current offer (562) is significantly better than walking away and receiving my outside offer.\n\n**Evaluating a Counteroffer:**\n\nBefore accepting, let's consider if a counteroffer could yield an even better outcome. Given that we only have three rounds and Player 1 is making relatively balanced offers, pushing too hard might lead to a walkaway from Player 1. My highest values are for items 2, 3, and 5. The current offer gives me less of items 2 and 5. But the offered amount of item 3 is half of my overall stock, which gives me more value than giving to player 1, so I will accept the offer.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (562) is greater than my outside offer (353), and it is risky to make a counteroffer, I will accept the offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and Player 1 has offered me [1, 0, 1, 0, 4] units of item 1, item 2, item 3, item 4, and item 5, respectively. My private values are 74, 43, 29, 95, and 78 for these items. My outside offer is 1415. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(1 * 74) + (0 * 43) + (1 * 29) + (0 * 95) + (4 * 78) = 74 + 0 + 29 + 0 + 312 = 415\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum possible value I can get if I get all the items:\n(5 * 74) + (2 * 43) + (6 * 29) + (5 * 95) + (6 * 78) = 370 + 86 + 174 + 475 + 468 = 1573\n\nMy outside offer is 1415. If I walk away, I get 1415.\n\nIf I accept the current offer, I get 415.\n\nLet's consider what happens if I make a counteroffer. I have two more rounds to negotiate. The discount factor is 0.9.\nI want to maximize my expected value. In the last round, if I make a counteroffer, it's equivalent to walking away.\n\nLet's aim for a split that gives me at least my outside offer. This means I want Player 1 to have a maximum value of 1573 - 1415 = 158.\n\nI need to decide if accepting now, walking away, or making a counteroffer is the best strategy. Since my outside offer is significantly higher than the value of the current offer (1415 vs 415), it's unlikely that Player 1 is aware of the true distribution of our private values.\n\nGiven that it is round 1, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to what I would ideally want. I will consider the items and their values, and construct an offer that moves some of the more valuable items to my side. I will offer Player 1 items that I value less.\n\nA reasonable counteroffer would be to give Player 1 more of item 3 and item 2, and ask for less of item 5. I will suggest offering [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]. That means I keep 5 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4 and 4 of item 5. The value of my allocation is: 5*74 + 1*43 + 3*29 + 5*95 + 4*78 = 370 + 43 + 87 + 475 + 312 = 1287. Not ideal since there's still room to try to get closer to 1415.\n\nLet's modify the offer slightly to increase my value. Let's try offer [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]. That leaves me with 5*74 + 1*43 + 3*29 + 5*95 + 5*78 = 370 + 43 + 87 + 475 + 390 = 1365.\nSince it is only round 1, let's make a counteroffer that improves my standing significantly and see how Player 1 responds.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]}\n```",

Thus, accepting it would give me a lower value.\n\nGiven that the current offer value after discounting is less than my outside offer, I should not accept the offer. Instead, I should make a counteroffer that provides a higher value to me, ensuring it remains appealing to Player 2 or at least allows for potential future negotiation improvement.\n\nTo create a strategically better position than my previous offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 4], I need to adjust the division within remaining quantities (especially focusing on items with a high value to me).\n\nMy revised counteroffer needs to aim for a total value exceeding my discounted outside offer power. Therefore, I propose:\n\n- Take 4 units of item 1, as it is high value to me (71 per unit).\n- Take 1 unit of item 2, leaving Player 2 the remaining high value unit.\n- Give Player 2 more of the remaining item 5 to reconcile our interests while keeping enough to exceed my outside offer.\n\nFinalizing my counteroffer considering these valuations:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 1, 3]}",

This represents the units of each item Player 1 is offering to me.  My values for each item are 74, 43, 29, 95, and 78, respectively. Therefore, the value of this offer to me is:\n\n(1 * 74) + (1 * 43) + (3 * 29) + (1 * 95) + (3 * 78) = 74 + 43 + 87 + 95 + 234 = 533\n\nSince this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  Therefore, the present value of accepting this offer is 533 * 0.9 = 479.7.\n\nMy outside offer is 1415.  If I walk away, I get 1415.\n\nNow, I need to consider if I can make a counteroffer that is better than accepting the current offer or walking away. To do this, I need to estimate Player 1's values and think about the maximum Player 1 would accept.  I don't know Player 1's values, so I have to make some assumptions.\n\nThe current offer to Player 1 would consist of:\nItem 1: 5-1 = 4\nItem 2: 2-1 = 1\nItem 3: 6-3 = 3\nItem 4: 5-1 = 4\nItem 5: 6-3 = 3\n\nWithout knowing Player 1's values, it is difficult to calculate the value of items that Player 1 will receive based on the current counter offer. I'm also running the risk of being in the last round, and if I make a counteroffer, this will automatically be treated as a WALK.\n\nGiven my outside option of 1415 and the current offer value of 479.7, walking away is significantly better than accepting the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm Player 2, and Player 1 has offered me [0, 1, 4, 0, 3] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My values for these items are 71, 35, 96, 80, and 6. My outside offer is 1195. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 1's offer to me:\n(0 * 71) + (1 * 35) + (4 * 96) + (0 * 80) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 35 + 384 + 0 + 18 = 437\n\nSince 437 is much less than my outside offer of 1195, accepting this offer would be a bad deal.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while ensuring Player 1 also gets at least their outside option value (which I don't know, but I need to make a reasonable guess). I have 7 units of item 1, 2 of item 2, 7 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. My values are 71, 35, 96, 80, and 6.\n\nLet's try to offer Player 1 something that is appealing to them, while keeping the items I value most. I want to keep as much of item 3 (value 96) and item 4 (value 80) as possible for myself.\n\nI don't know Player 1's values, but I can make an educated guess that they also value items 3 and 4. I need to give them enough of something to make them accept. Let's start by offering them a good chunk of item 1, a bit of item 3, and perhaps some item 5. \n\nHere is my reasoning:\n\nIf I give them all 7 of item 1 and 4 of item 5, these items have high quantities. If they value item 1 high too, this can compensate. Then, depending on my expectation of their values, I decide how much item 3 to give them.\n\nLet's say that I were to offer them [7, 0, 3, 0, 4]. Then I get to keep [0, 2, 4, 2, 0]. This gives me a value of (0 * 71) + (2 * 35) + (4 * 96) + (2 * 80) + (0 * 6) = 0 + 70 + 384 + 160 + 0 = 614.\nSince this is still less than my outside offer, even without the discount factor, I need to aim higher. Since this is round 1, there is the possibility that it is more profitable to offer less now and hope to accept a later offer in rounds 2 and 3.\n\nLet's consider offering them [6, 0, 2, 0, 3]. Then I get to keep [1, 2, 5, 2, 1]. This gives me a value of (1 * 71) + (2 * 35) + (5 * 96) + (2 * 80) + (1 * 6) = 71 + 70 + 480 + 160 + 6 = 787.\n\nThis is better, but still quite a bit lower than my outside option.\n\nTo get closer to my outside offer of 1195, I will make them a final offer of [5, 0, 1, 0, 2]. This ensures I keep more of what I value highly. I believe this could be an attractive offer to Player 1.\n\nIf I offer them [5, 0, 1, 0, 2], this means that I am keeping [2, 2, 6, 2, 2]. My value in this case is:\n(2 * 71) + (2 * 35) + (6 * 96) + (2 * 80) + (2 * 6) = 142 + 70 + 576 + 160 + 12 = 960\n\nThis is now reasonably close to my discounted outside offer of 0.9*1195 = 1075.5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

The value for me from this offer was: \n     - My receive: [4, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n     - Value = \\(4*88 + 2*88 + 3*80 + 2*98 + 3*38\\) = 1412\n     - Discounted value = \\(1412 * 0.81 = 1143.72\\), which seems competitive.\n\n   Considering the negotiation is in the final phase and my previous concessions were not accepted, I will try a slightly more favorable counter offer for Player 2: \n\n   Let's keep items that are most valuable to me while slightly increasing offers for less valuable ones to incentive acceptance:\n   - Offer [2, 0, 4, 0, 3] to Player 2, keeping high-value items largely on my side while slightly improving terms for player 2 by increasing their item 5 from 1 to 3.\n\n   **Counteroffer Assessment:**\n   - My receive: [5, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n   - Value = \\(5*88 + 2*88 + 3*80 + 2*98 + 1*38\\) = 1330\n   - Discounted value = \\(1330 * 0.81 \\approx 1077.3\\)\n\n   Since this still does not exceed my outside offer, and given the history of hard-line offers, I will aim slightly higher without much risk.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to **WALK** because the potential gains in this round do not exceed my guaranteed outside offer value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I want to maximize my value, considering the discount factor and Player 1's likely rationality.\n\n**Reasoning about a Counteroffer**\n\nBefore making a counteroffer, let's assess my needs and Player 1's likely perspective. Since Player 1 made an offer, they are not walking away immediately.\n\n*   My strongest items are items 4 and 5.\n*   My weakest items are items 2 and 3.\n\nI want to make a counteroffer that is attractive enough for Player 1 to accept, while still significantly improving my position. The key is to figure out Player 1's values. Since these are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101, on average Player 1's values will be roughly 51. This means that on average, giving Player 1 one unit is worth about 51 to them.\n\nLet's evaluate the consequences of counteroffer. This leaves Player 1 with the choice of accepting, walking away, or offering again in the final round. If they choose to walk away then they receive their outside offer, if they offer again, I receive a highly discounted version of whatever items they offer me. I therefore want to find the allocation that will maximize my value while allowing Player 1 to accept in the second round.\n\nHere's a possible strategy:\n*   Give them more of items they value less and I value less (items 2 and 3).\n*   Try to keep most of items 4 and 5.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 the following:\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 2\n*   Item 4: 1\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nThis leaves me with:\n*   Item 1: 1 (Value: 41)\n*   Item 2: 1 (Value: 12)\n*   Item 3: 1 (Value: 4)\n*   Item 4: 2 (Value: 146)\n*   Item 5: 2 (Value: 150)\n*   Total Value: 353\n\nThis value (353) exceeds accepting the original offer. Since this is in the second round, I multiply this by 0.9 to get the actual value which is equal to 317.7\n\nI would make the counteroffer.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

So, the present value of accepting this offer is 86.\n\nNow, let's consider the alternatives. If I walk away, I get my outside offer of 425. If I make a counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might accept and the potential discount in later rounds.\n\nI need to figure out what a reasonable counteroffer would be. My goal is to get more than 86, but also to avoid a walk-away. Let's consider making a counteroffer that gives Player 1 slightly more than they are getting now, but allows me to capture a significant amount of value, and exceeds 86. I will try and aim for something that yields a value for me higher than 425/0.9 = 472 in round 2, so that walking away becomes less attractive.\n\nMy total items available:\nItem 1: 6\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 2\n\nLet's start by considering a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 3 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 1 unit of Item 5.

This leaves me with 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nMy value would be 3*26+3*34+3*27+3*55+2*37 = 78 + 102 + 81 + 165 + 74 = 500.\n\nGiven the situation, making a counteroffer seems like the best approach, as the current offer is too low compared to my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Therefore, I shouldn't accept this offer *unless* I believe that my next counteroffer has zero chance of succeeding, such that I'll have to WALK and accept the 425.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer**\n\nI need to determine what a reasonable counteroffer would be. My goal is to get as much as possible while still being realistic enough to avoid a walk away from player 1. Let's look at the total number of items: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n\nHere is my current optimal allocation of items for me: all units of Item 4 and Item 5 (high values), and enough of Items 1 and 2 to reach my outside offer value.\n\nLet's calculate the most I can extract in value from the remaining items if player 1 keeps his original offer of item 1 and item 2, then factor in the discount rate for round 3 if they refuse.\n\nThe current offer is [4, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means that player 1 will have 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nLet's create a counteroffer where I request more items such that, if accepted in round 3, the value after discount rate is equal to my current outside offer.\n\nLet x1 = quantity of item 1, x2 = quantity of item 2, x3 = quantity of item 3, x4 = quantity of item 4, and x5 = quantity of item 5 I want. Then:\n(x1 * 26) + (x2 * 34) + (x3 * 27) + (x4 * 55) + (x5 * 37) * (0.9)^2 = 425\nSince the current offer is [4, 1, 0, 1, 0], x1 = 6, x2 = 3, x3 = 0, x4 = 1, and x5 = 0, this calculates as:\n(6*26 + 3*34 + 0 + 1*55 + 0) * 0.81 = (156 + 102 + 55) * 0.81 = 313 * 0.81 = 253.53, much less than my outside offer.\n\nThus, in order to get an amount greater than my current outside offer, I must make a counteroffer. Given that player 1 is likely to respond similarly, I should at least aim for more item 4.\nThe best counter offer would be offering player 1 nothing of value (item 1, 2, or 3) in return for all of items 4 and 5. This means offering [0, 0, 0, 3, 2].\nValue to me in round 2: (6 * 26) + (3 * 34) + (3 * 27) + (0 * 55) + (0 * 37) = 156 + 102 + 81 + 0 + 0 = 339\n339 * 0.9 = 305.1, which is still below my outside offer of 425.\n\nHowever, if I don't get any of item 4, but receive more of items 1 and 2, the value could increase substantially.\nFor example, if the offer is [6, 3, 0, 0, 0], then the value is (6*26 + 3*34) * 0.9 = (156+102) * 0.9 = 258 * 0.9 = 232.2.\nI can try to give the player some of item 3 in place of item 1 or 2, since that might encourage them to accept.\nLet's test the offer [3, 1, 0, 1, 0] given to me. This means that they get [3, 2, 3, 2, 2]. Let's say that they value each of these items at 50 to make the estimation easier. Then the player gets 3*50+2*50+3*50+2*50+2*50 = 12*50 = 600. If I offered them [2, 1, 1, 2, 1], their value would be: 2*50 + 1*50 + 1*50 + 2*50 + 1*50 = 7*50 = 350. That makes them get only 350 in return for a value of 193, which is not worth it.\n\nIt is not possible to determine how much the other agent values each item, so it is important to ensure my payout is maximized.\n\n**Decision**\n\nGiven the above analysis, the best course of action is to offer a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 3, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 2]}\n```",

Therefore, any negotiation outcome needs to provide me with a value exceeding this amount after considering the discount factor.\n\n4. **Discount Factor (Gamma = 0.9)**: The value of the deal is multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1). In the first round, the discount does not apply, making this round's offers most valuable.\n\nGiven the high private value for items, my goal is to make an offer that ensures I retain as much value as possible, while still making a reasonable offer to Player 2. I need to structure the offer to ensure it provides me value over 1184 in the first round.\n\n5. **Calculate total value based on retaining certain units**:\n   - Calculate the value of all items to me: \n     - Item 1: 62 * 5 = 310\n     - Item 2: 58 * 6 = 348\n     - Item 3: 88 * 7 = 616\n     - Item 4: 28 * 6 = 168\n     - Item 5: 85 * 2 = 170\n   - Total Value: 310 + 348 + 616 + 168 + 170 = 1612\n\n6. **Strategy for Initial Offer**:\n   - Try to retain high-value items (especially item 3 and item 5)\n   - Offer fewer units of these higher value items, or none if possible, while providing more of those that might hold less value to me but perhaps more to Player 2.\n\n7. **Proposal for Counteroffer**:\n   - I need to retain sufficient value over 1184 directly, so my first offer aims to keep high-value items:\n     - Offer 0 units of item 1\n     - Offer 0 units of item 2\n     - Offer 3 units of item 3 (retaining most value)\n     - Offer 6 units of item 4 (lower value to me)\n     - Offer 0 units of item 5\n\nThis distribution means the value retained would be:\n\n- Item 1: 310\n- Item 2: 348\n- Item 3: 352 (4 units * 88)\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 170\n\nRetained Value = 310 + 348 + 352 + 0 + 170 = 1180 (close, but needs adjustment)\n\nAfter checking, I need to ensure an above-retained value of 1184.\n\nRevised Offer:\n- Offer 5 of item 4, retain 1 unit: Value increases by 28, retained becomes 1208.\n\nTherefore, the initial offer to Player 2 is:\n\n**Action:** \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 5, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2 in Round 1.\n\n**Understanding the Current Offer**\n\nThe current offer on the table is [0, 0, 3, 5, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me:\n\n*   0 units of item 1\n*   0 units of item 2\n*   3 units of item 3\n*   5 units of item 4\n*   0 units of item 5\n\n**Calculating the Value of the Current Offer**\n\nMy private values are:\n\n*   Item 1: 83\n*   Item 2: 8\n*   Item 3: 3\n*   Item 4: 7\n*   Item 5: 85\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n\n(0 * 83) + (0 * 8) + (3 * 3) + (5 * 7) + (0 * 85) = 0 + 0 + 9 + 35 + 0 = 44\n\n**Considering the Discount Factor and Outside Offer**\n\n*   Discount factor (gamma) = 0.9\n*   Outside offer value = 591\n\nIf I accept the current offer, my value is 44.\nIf I walk away, my value is 591.\nIf I counteroffer, we move to the next round, and my value is discounted by 0.9.\n\n**Evaluating a Counteroffer**\n\nI need to determine if there's a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial and lead to a higher expected value for me than either accepting or walking away.\n\nMy total value for all items is (5 * 83) + (6 * 8) + (7 * 3) + (6 * 7) + (2 * 85) = 415 + 48 + 21 + 42 + 170 = 696\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me 3 units of item 3 and 5 units of item 4. I value these at 3 and 7, respectively. Player 1 must value them at some other amount from 1 to 101. I have high values for items 1 and 5, so these would be the items that I would try to retain.\n\nIf I could craft an offer that gave player 1 enough that he/she values more than his/her outside option, it would likely lead to a better outcome for me. \n\nHowever, given that my outside offer (591) is reasonably high and the current offer is only valued at 44, it's unlikely that I can craft a counteroffer in round 1 that would lead to a significantly better outcome. Even with the discount factor, walking away is likely better than accepting a deal valued at 44.\n\nI should consider that the total value of items is 696. If player 1 gave me zero items, then the value to me would be zero. That means that I value all the items at 696 and that is how I calculated my outside offer from the problem description.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1 all of items 1 and 5, and nothing else, which would be [5, 0, 0, 0, 2]. The value to me would be zero for those items. This would leave me with [0, 6, 7, 6, 0]. The value to me of these remaining items would be (0 * 83) + (6 * 8) + (7 * 3) + (6 * 7) + (0 * 85) = 0 + 48 + 21 + 42 + 0 = 111. Discounted, this is 111 * 0.9 = 99.9, still less than my walkaway.\n\n**Decision**\n\nSince the value of the current offer is much lower than my outside offer, and it's difficult to construct a beneficial counteroffer in round 1, the best course of action is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

They are offering me [1, 0, 3, 1, 1], which means I would receive:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 0 units of item 2\n* 3 units of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy valuation for this offer is:\n(1 * 96) + (0 * 8) + (3 * 51) + (1 * 62) + (1 * 42) = 96 + 0 + 153 + 62 + 42 = 353\n\nMy outside offer is 256. So, accepting the current offer would give me a value of 353, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum possible value I can obtain if I get all the items:\n(5 * 96) + (0 * 8) + (6 * 51) + (5 * 62) + (2 * 42) = 480 + 0 + 306 + 310 + 84 = 1180\n\nPlayer 1's offer leaves them with:\n* 4 units of item 1\n* 0 units of item 2\n* 3 units of item 3\n* 4 units of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nSince I don't know Player 1's valuations, it's hard to predict their best course of action. However, I know my outside offer is 256, and accepting the current offer gives me 353.

I can counteroffer by giving them a different portion. Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 almost everything, leaving me with just enough to be slightly better than my outside option, accounting for the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nI want to get at least 634 in present value terms.\nLet's see what minimal amount I can keep.\nIf I accept a counteroffer next round then it's 0.9 * value. So I need to ask for at least 634 / 0.9 in next round.

I want to ensure that this gives Player 1 a good incentive to accept.\nI will offer Player 1: [1, 2, 7, 5, 0]. Then I will have: [0, 0, 3, 0, 1]. The value of this offer to me is 3 * 91 + 1 * 83 = 273 + 83 = 356. Now 356 < 634, so I need to get more value.\n\nI will propose the following: I will give Player 1 item 1, both of item 2, 7 units of item 3, all units of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\nCounteroffer: [1, 2, 7, 5, 0]\nThe value to me would then be: 3 * 91 + 1 * 83 = 273 + 83 = 356\nHowever, if I want to walk away in the next round, it would only be 0.9*634. So I would need to have at least 634. Then I need to get at least 634/0.9 in the round 2.\n\nThe offer [0, 1, 4, 2, 1] gives me 562, which is less than my outside option. Let's counteroffer to get a better deal.\nI propose to give Player 1 [1, 1, 7, 3, 0]. This leaves me with [0, 1, 3, 2, 1]. My value for this would be (1*53)+(3*91)+(2*31)+(1*83) = 53 + 273 + 62 + 83 = 471. This is still lower than my outside option, and this is not good for me.\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 almost everything, leaving me just enough to beat my outside offer in Round 2 if necessary.\nCounteroffer: [1, 2, 7, 5, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 7, 5, 0]}\n```",

As Player 2 didn\u2019t reveal any preference yet, we must assume each item could have a varied value. \n\n   A balanced starting offer might involve offering them more of the less valuable items to me, keeping more of the high-value ones.\n\n   - Offer 1 unit of item 1 (value to me = 19)\n   - Offer 3 units of item 2 (value to me = 51)\n   - Offer 2 units of item 3 (value to me = 82)\n   - Offer 0 units of item 4 (value to me = 0)\n   - Offer 1 unit of item 5 (value to me = 50)\n\n   Items left for me:\n\n   - Item 1: 1 unit (value 19)\n   - Item 2: 2 units (value 34)\n   - Item 3: 2 units (value 82)\n   - Item 4: 2 units (value 156)\n   - Item 5: 3 units (value 150)\n\n   My total value = 19 + 34 + 82 + 156 + 150 = 441.\n\n   This is less than my potential outside offer, but it's important to weigh it against the ongoing negotiation and encourage a positive dialogue with Player 2.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the initial offer I will make to Player 2 is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 2. The current offer on the table is [1, 3, 2, 0, 1], which means I get 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My private values are 46, 56, 60, 57, 28 for items 1 to 5, respectively. My outside offer is 94. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 46) + (3 * 56) + (2 * 60) + (0 * 57) + (1 * 28) = 46 + 168 + 120 + 0 + 28 = 362\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.  So, the present value of the offer is 362. This is significantly higher than my outside offer of 94.\n\nHowever, I need to consider what a good counteroffer strategy might be. I have 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\nIf I were to accept, I'd get a value of 362.\n\nNow, let's think about a counteroffer. I want to maximize my gain while making it appealing enough for Player 1 to accept in a later round. I need to consider Player 1's potential values, which I don't know.  A reasonable approach is to offer Player 1 items I value less and keep more of the items I value higher.\n\nGiven the current offer is already quite favorable to me, I should accept. Creating a counter offer has a high risk of pushing the deal into later rounds with the discount factor.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I want to maximize my value, so I need to give Player 1 items that I value less and keep items that I value more.  My lowest value items are Item 2 (value 10) and Item 1 (value 44). Items 3, 4 and 5 are of higher value. The total number of available items are 3, 5, 4, 4, and 5 respectively. The current offer gives me [1, 3, 0, 3, 2]. So the number of items remaining with Player 1 are [2, 2, 4, 1, 3].\n\nIf I were to accept, my value is 329. If I walk, my value is 179.\n\nLet's try to formulate a counteroffer that might be accepted. Since this is round 1, there's room to negotiate. I should aim for something better than the current offer and better than my walkaway.\n\nI value Item 1 at 44, and the total quantity is 3. I value Item 2 at 10, and the total quantity is 5. Currently, I am getting 1 unit of Item 1 and 3 units of Item 2. I want to improve on this. A possible counteroffer is to give Player 1 more of the Item 2 (which I value less) to gain more units of Item 5 and maybe Item 4 (which I value more). I could also attempt to take more of Item 1 which I value reasonably.\n\nConsidering the current offer [1, 3, 0, 3, 2] and my value of 329, I will make a counteroffer to improve my position. The counteroffer will give [2, 2, 1, 0, 1] to Player 1.

Assuming Player 2 has different valuations, they might highly value different items. Therefore, I'll try to offer items I value the least while keeping more valuable items.\n\nHere's a strategy for the first offer:\n\n1. Offer most or all units of items I value the least (Item 1).\n2. Retain more units of items I value highly (Items 2, 4, 5).\n\nInitial Offer to Player 2:\n- Offer 6 units of Item 1 (value to me = 6 * 1 = 6)\n- Offer 2 units of Item 3 (value to me = 2 * 44 = 88)\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 5 (value to me = 1 * 63 = 63)\n\nValues of remaining for me:\n- Item 1: 1 * 1 = 1 (1 unit left)\n- Item 2: 5 * 68 = 340 (5 units left)\n- Item 3: 1 * 44 = 44 (1 unit left)\n- Item 4: 4 * 99 = 396 (4 units left)\n- Item 5: 2 * 63 = 126 (2 units left)\n\nTotal potential value for me in this offer:\n1 (Item 1) + 340 (Item 2) + 44 (Item 3) + 396 (Item 4) + 126 (Item 5) = 907\n\nThis value is less than my outside offer of 992, so it remains negotiable.

This means if a deal is not reached, my fallback is 73. To justify not walking away, I should aim for a deal value significantly greater than 73 after discounts.\n\n**Negotiation Considerations:**\n- My total value from all items is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n- I should aim to secure the items with the highest per unit value to me, which are primarily items 3 and 4.\n- It\u2019s round 1, so future rounds apply a discount factor y = 0.9, reducing effective value with each round; hence, an early favorable deal is preferred.\n\n**Ideal Initial Counteroffer:**\n1. Aim to keep most/some items 3 and 4 for myself, as they hold most value.\n2. Offer more units of items with lesser value to me \u2013 items 1, 2, and 5.\n\n**Offer Proposal:**\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 3 units (I keep 1)\n  - Item 2: 2 units (I keep 1)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (I keep 4, high priority for me)\n  - Item 4: 1 unit (I keep 3)\n  - Item 5: 3 units (I keep 1)\n\nThis gives Player 2 significant amount of items, possibly catering to their key values, especially if they value any of items 1, 2, or 5. I keep majority power over high value items for my own valuation, asserting initial power.\n\nThus, the offer is designed to potentially appeal to a broad set of strategies that Player 2 might employ if their values on the items diverge from mine.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 1, 3]}",

My goal is to maximize my expected value.\nI need to consider Player 1's potential values for the items.

My private values are 55, 23, 2, 46, 41 for items 1 through 5. My outside offer is 810.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer:\nValue = (4 * 55) + (2 * 23) + (1 * 2) + (3 * 46) + (1 * 41) = 220 + 46 + 2 + 138 + 41 = 447\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So the present value of accepting the offer is simply 447. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 810.\n\nTherefore, I should consider making a counteroffer. To determine a good counteroffer, I need to consider Player 1's potential values. Since I don't know Player 1's values, I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 approximately half of the total value if they had the same item values as me.\n\nThe total units of each item are 8, 4, 2, 6, and 3. To give Player 1 approximately half, I would offer Player 1 [4, 2, 1, 3, 1].

My values for these items are 21, 20, 80, 61, and 41. My outside offer is 611, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(3 * 21) + (5 * 20) + (1 * 80) + (0 * 61) + (1 * 41) = 63 + 100 + 80 + 0 + 41 = 284\n\nSince this is round 1, if I accept, my value will be 284 * (0.9^(1-1)) = 284. My outside offer is 611.  Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away immediately.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1, and I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer. Let's think about what a reasonable counteroffer might be. My total value for all items is 748. I need to offer Player 1 enough to make them prefer the deal to their outside offer. I don't know Player 1's values or outside offer, so I will have to make some assumptions. A reasonable approach is to aim for an approximately equal split of the total value, or at least a split that offers me more than my outside option and is attractive for player 1.\n\nThe total number of items is 5 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 21\nTotal value is (5 * 21) + (9 * 20) + (4 * 80) + (1 * 61) + (2 * 41) = 105 + 180 + 320 + 61 + 82 = 748.\n\nLet's aim for a counteroffer that gives me a value of at least 611 (my outside option) discounted by 0.9, or approximately 679. Let's try to construct an offer where I keep most of item 3, 4 and 5 and some of the items 1 and 2.\n\nSince I value item 3 highly, I want to keep most of it. Let's say I give player 1 item distribution [2,4,0,0,0].\nThe values to me would be (3*21)+(5*20)+(4*80)+(1*61)+(2*41) = 63+100+320+61+82 = 626\nThen after discount, my value would be 626 * 0.9 = 563.4. This is below my outside offer.\n\nLet's try an offer which gives Player 1 most of the value, say offering them [4, 7, 2, 1, 1].\nThis would leave me with [1, 2, 2, 0, 1] which is (1*21) + (2*20) + (2*80) + (0*61) + (1*41) = 21+40+160+0+41=262. This is way lower than my walkaway.\n\nLet's offer [1, 3, 0, 0, 0].\nThis means that I keep [4, 6, 4, 1, 2] which is (4*21)+(6*20)+(4*80)+(1*61)+(2*41) = 84+120+320+61+82 = 667.

If I walk away, I get 666. So, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow let's consider a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 enough to make them prefer my offer over walking away, but also ensure I get more than my outside offer after the discount factor.\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nI have 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5. The current offer gives Player 1:\n- 3 - 1 = 2 units of item 1\n- 3 - 1 = 2 units of item 2\n- 4 - 1 = 3 units of item 3\n- 6 - 4 = 2 units of item 4\n- 7 - 3 = 4 units of item 5\n\nTo make an informed counteroffer, I need to consider Player 1's valuation. Unfortunately, I don't know their valuation, so I need to make an offer that is likely to be accepted while also being good for me. A safe strategy is to make a slightly better offer than what I am currently being offered, to test the waters. I will offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 4, 3] + a little extra. I'll slightly adjust the items I value less.\nLet me offer them:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis gives me:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nMy value is (3*46) + (3*5) + (3*25) + (3*29) + (4*43) = 138 + 15 + 75 + 87 + 172 = 487\n\nThis isn't better than my outside option (666). Let's make an offer such that I'm close to my outside option if they accept next round, factoring in the discount. 666/0.9 = 740. I'll aim for a value close to this amount.\n\nI will offer the other player:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nMy value is (3*46) + (3*5) + (4*25) + (6*29) + (7*43) = 138 + 15 + 100 + 174 + 301 = 728\n\nThis gives Player 1 nothing. This is unlikely to be accepted and is essentially a WALK. Let's improve it. I'll give Player 1 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nI will offer the other player:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis gives me:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 6 units of item 5\n\nMy value is (3*46) + (3*5) + (4*25) + (5*29) + (6*43) = 138 + 15 + 100 + 145 + 258 = 656\nStill not good enough.\n\nI will WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
