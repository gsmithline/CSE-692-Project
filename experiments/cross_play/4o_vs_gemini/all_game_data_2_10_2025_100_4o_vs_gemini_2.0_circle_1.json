I don't know Player 1's values, so I'm going to have to guess.\n\nSince my outside offer is 366, I want to aim for a value higher than that *after* the discount. So I want to end up with approximately 366/0.9 = 406.67 in round 2. If the negotiations fail after round 2, the discount will be applied again. Therefore, I would rather walk away than accept an offer worth less than 366.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 slightly more than half of the items.

I value items in the order 3, 1, 2, 4, 5.\nI have 4 units of item 1, 4 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 3 of item 5.\n\nLet's try to make an offer that gives Player 1 a decent value.\nI will offer Player 1: [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]. This means I keep 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\nMy value for this counteroffer will be (2*26) + (3*19) + (3*41) + (2*19) + (2*3) = 52 + 57 + 123 + 38 + 6 = 276.\nWith discount factor 1, this gives a value of 276, much lower than my walkaway of 334.\n\nLet's try another counteroffer, aiming for a value closer to my outside offer:\nOffer Player 1: [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nI keep: [3, 4, 4, 3, 3]\nMy value: (3*26) + (4*19) + (4*41) + (3*19) + (3*3) = 78 + 76 + 164 + 57 + 9 = 384\n\nOffer Player 1: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nI keep: [3, 4, 5, 3, 3]\nMy value: (3*26) + (4*19) + (5*41) + (3*19) + (3*3) = 78 + 76 + 205 + 57 + 9 = 425\n\nOffer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nI keep: [4, 4, 6, 3, 3]\nMy value: (4*26) + (4*19) + (6*41) + (3*19) + (3*3) = 104 + 76 + 246 + 57 + 9 = 492\n\nIt seems I value these items a lot.\nSince the current offer is only worth 142 to me, significantly less than my outside offer of 334, I should make a counteroffer. I want to improve my position while leaving Player 1 with something reasonable. Let's offer Player 1 [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]. This results in me having a value of 276, better than the current offer, but still less than my outside offer.\n\nNow, I will walk away to get my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

However, it's round 1, so I might be able to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nTo determine a good counteroffer, I need to estimate Player 1's values. Since they offered me [2, 2, 1, 2, 1], they must value the remaining items (what they keep) at least as much as I value what they offered me. They are keeping [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give them just a little more than what they offered me. This might encourage them to accept, and it avoids a potential walk-away in later rounds due to the discount factor. I want to minimize what I give while hoping it will be accepted. I should probably give them a bit more of what I value less.\n\nLet's try offering them: [1, 1, 1, 3, 2].  This is slightly better for them, and worse for me. Now I'm keeping [3, 3, 2, 1, 1].\nValue to me: (3 * 81) + (3 * 81) + (2 * 47) + (1 * 5) + (1 * 1) = 243 + 243 + 94 + 5 + 1 = 586\nThis is more than the initial offer, so is better.\n\nLet's consider another possibility. Maybe Player 1 is desperate for a particular item. I can give them more of that item and keep the higher value items for myself. Let's see what happens if I offer them [0, 0, 0, 4, 3].\n\nMy value: (4 * 81) + (4 * 81) + (3 * 47) + (0 * 5) + (0 * 1) = 324 + 324 + 141 + 0 + 0 = 789\n\nPlayer 1's Offer: [2, 2, 1, 2, 1] = 382\nMy Outside Offer: 222\nMy offer [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]: 586\nMy offer [0, 0, 0, 4, 3]: 789\n\nSince the offer [0, 0, 0, 4, 3] yields the highest value, let's go with that.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 3]}\n```",

Since we are in round 1, there is no discount yet, but future rounds will apply a discount factor of 0.9.\n\n4. **Strategy for Initial Offer:** \n   - To entice a favorable negotiation, I should offer items that either have a lower value to me or fewer items in total, hence keeping higher value items to myself.\n   - Therefore, I'll try to offer more of those items which have less value to me and retain those of higher value.\n\n5. **Offer Formation:**\n   - I will consider offering minimal units of high-value items to Player 2.\n   - A suitable starting strategy is to offer a balanced value proposal where I retain significant control over the total value.\n   - Here's a balanced proposal keeping my interests in mind:\n     - Item 1: Offer 2 (keep 3; value to me: 180)\n     - Item 2: Offer 4 (keep 1; value to me: 6)\n     - Item 3: Offer 3 (keep 7; value to me: 525)\n     - Item 4: Offer 0 (keep 5; value to me: 110)\n     - Item 5: Offer 1 (keep 3; value to me: 111)\n   - My total retained value = 180 + 6 + 525 + 110 + 111 = 932\n\n6. **Comparison:**\n   - The retained value of 932 is lower than the outside offer of 1078, but this is an initial offer to establish a negotiation position. \n   - Ideally, I'd like to push for adjustments in my favor in future rounds or press for maximum final retained value close to 1078 if necessary.\n\nBased on the above reasoning and strategy, my initial offer to Player 2 is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 3, 0, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 70 (5 units available)\n- Item 2: 64 (5 units available)\n- Item 3: 13 (10 units available)\n- Item 4: 19 (5 units available)\n- Item 5: 19 (4 units available)\n\nPlayer 1's offer to me is: [2, 4, 3, 0, 1]\n\nThis means I would get:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy value for this offer is: (2 * 70) + (4 * 64) + (3 * 13) + (0 * 19) + (1 * 19) = 140 + 256 + 39 + 0 + 19 = 454\n\nMy outside offer is 593.\n\nIf I accept now, I get 454. If I walk away, I get 593. Clearly, walking away is better than accepting the current offer *right now*. However, we're only in round 1. There are two more rounds of negotiation. If I can get Player 1 to improve their offer, accepting later might be better than walking away now (taking into account the discount factor).\n\nLet's think about a reasonable counteroffer. I need to give Player 1 something that costs me relatively little but they might value more. Item 3 has the lowest value for me.\nPlayer 1 is offering me 3 units of item 3. Let's start by offering them all remaining units of item 3 and some more item 4s.\nThere are 10 total units, I am receiving 3 units, that means they are receiving 7 right now. That means giving away 7 units.\n\nLet me consider offering the bare minimum which I find acceptable *at the very end*.\nIf I accept in round 3 I want to get at least my outside offer discounted over 2 rounds, which is 593*(0.9^2) = 479.13\nIf I accept in round 2 I want to get at least my outside offer discounted over 1 round, which is 593*(0.9^1) = 533.7\n\nFor now, I will make a counteroffer. I'll offer Player 1 a distribution that yields me a slightly higher value than my outside option if it were discounted to round 3, assuming that is more appealing to player 1 than my outside offer discounted to round 3.\n\nI want to calculate what I would be willing to offer Player 1 such that I would still get 479.13\n\nMy total value is 971. I need to keep 479.13. That means I would offer Player 1 971 - 479.13 = 491.87 value.\n\nLet me make a counteroffer.\nI will offer them [3, 1, 7, 1, 0].\nPlayer 1 gets:\n3 of Item 1\n1 of Item 2\n7 of Item 3\n1 of Item 4\n0 of Item 5\nI get\n2 of Item 1\n4 of Item 2\n3 of Item 3\n4 of Item 4\n4 of Item 5\nMy value is: (2 * 70) + (4 * 64) + (3 * 13) + (4 * 19) + (4 * 19) = 140 + 256 + 39 + 76 + 76 = 587\n\nThis isn't enough to get above 593, so I will tweak the offer. If I give another item 2 to Player 1 and get one more item 3, here is what I get\nGive [3, 2, 6, 1, 0]\nGet [2, 3, 4, 4, 4]\nMy value = 140 + 192 + 52 + 76 + 76 = 536\nThis is still lower than 533.7. Okay, I'm starting low to gauge their reaction, but this is too low.\nLet's consider offer [1, 1, 5, 1, 0] to Player 1.\n\nThen I get:\n[4, 4, 5, 4, 4]\nMy value: 280 + 256 + 65 + 76 + 76 = 753.\nThis seems a bit too aggressive to start. I need a good starting counteroffer. I will settle on the one below, and accept in the last round if Player 1 hasn't at least matched the offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 7, 1, 0]}\n",

Therefore, the negotiation needs to provide me with more than 896 in terms of my perceived value after the discount to be worthwhile over the outside offer.\n\n3. **Decision for Round 1 Counteroffer:**\n   - To maximize my gains, I must try to keep items with the highest value to me. \n   - My highest value items are Item 1 (96/unit) and Item 3 (64/unit).\n   - I could propose giving up more of the lower-value items: Item 2, Item 4, and Item 5.\n\n4. **Calculate a Possible Fair Offer:**\n   - As a starting point, I will offer:\n     - Give away most of Item 2 and all of Item 4 and some of Item 5 to Player 2.\n   - Hold on to the majority of Item 1 and Item 3.\n\n   Considering my values and attempting a strategic split that could appeal to Player 2, I propose the following counteroffer:\n\n- **Counteroffer:**\n  - Offer 1 unit of Item 1 (Give 3 to me, value retained = 288)\n  - Offer 4 units of Item 2 (Keep 1 unit, value retained = 27)\n  - Offer 0 units of Item 3 (Keep all 6 units, value retained = 384)\n  - Offer 1 unit of Item 4 (Give all, value retained = 0)\n  - Offer 3 units of Item 5 (Keep 1 unit, value retained = 51)\n\n5. **Value Calculation of Counteroffer:**\n   - Total value kept by this offer for me = 288 + 27 + 384 + 0 + 51 = 750\n   - This offer would need to net more value after discounting for me to consider it over the outside offer.

Given my high value especially for items 3 and 4, I want to keep most of them.\n\n4. **Strategy for the Offer**:\n   - I could aim to keep as much as possible of the high-value items for myself (items 3 and 4), offering a minimal but fair amount of low-value items to Player 2. \n   - A reasonable starting offer for Player 2 could involve giving away more of item types that have less value to me and retaining the high-value ones:\n     - Item 1: Offer 2 (keeping 3)\n     - Item 2: Offer 1 (keeping 1)\n     - Item 3: Offer 1 (keeping 5)\n     - Item 4: Offer 1 (keeping 5)\n     - Item 5: Offer 0 (keeping 1)\n\n5. **Calculating My Value from the Proposed Offer**:\n   - By proposing to keep these:\n     - Item 1: 3 units * 74 = 222\n     - Item 2: 1 unit * 18 = 18\n     - Item 3: 5 units * 89 = 445\n     - Item 4: 5 units * 90 = 450\n     - Item 5: 1 unit * 28 = 28\n   - Total value = 222 + 18 + 445 + 450 + 28 = 1163\n\n6. **Discount Consideration**:\n   - If accepted in this round, my effective value doesn't need the discount factor.\n\nSince 1163 is substantially above my guaranteed outside option of 372, making this offer ensures a high outcome if accepted or leaves room for negotiation. \n\nThus, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Since the value of the current offer (284) is much lower than my outside offer, I should consider making a counteroffer or walking away.\n\nLet's consider the total number of each item available: 5 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\nThe offer to me is [2, 1, 1, 1, 0].

Since I don't know Player 1's values, I'll aim for an offer that gives me a value slightly above my outside offer, discounted by gamma.\n996 / 0.9 = 1106.67. So I'm aiming for about 1107.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer where I get most of item 2 and item 4, since they have the highest value for me.

This is still less than 1107 but it leaves player 1 with a reasonable amount of assets as well.\n\nHow about this: Let me have all of items 2, 4, 5. I give player 1 a majority of items 1 and 3.\n\nI offer Player 1: [4, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nWhich means I get: [1, 2, 1, 6, 1]\nMy value would be (1*18) + (2*92) + (1*62) + (6*94) + (1*54) = 18 + 184 + 62 + 564 + 54 = 882\n\nHow about:\nI offer Player 1: [3, 0, 4, 0, 0]\nThis means I receive: [2, 2, 2, 6, 1]\nMy value would be (2*18) + (2*92) + (2*62) + (6*94) + (1*54) = 36 + 184 + 124 + 564 + 54 = 962\n\nHow about:\nI offer Player 1: [3, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nThis means I receive: [2, 2, 3, 6, 1]\nMy value would be (2*18) + (2*92) + (3*62) + (6*94) + (1*54) = 36 + 184 + 186 + 564 + 54 = 1024\n\nThis is still below the 1107 target, but significantly better than the initial offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 3, 0, 0]}\n",

The current offer, even discounted, is far less valuable.\n\n**Possible Actions and Reasoning:**\n\n*   **ACCEPT:** This would give me a value of 410.4, which is significantly worse than my outside offer of 996.\n*   **WALK:** This would give me my outside offer of 996.\n*   **COUNTEROFFER:**  I need to consider if a counteroffer could potentially lead to a deal that's better than 996 (discounted). This is round 2, so I have limited time.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer:**\n\nMy goal is to get more value than 996, taking into account the discount factor. If I make a counteroffer, it will be round 3 and the discount factor will be 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\nTo get an idea of the value I need, 996 / 0.81 = 1229.63. This means that in order to be better than walking away I need the outcome of the negotiation to be better than 1229.63.\n\nMy highest value items are items 2 and 4. Player 1 has already offered me all the items 2 available. In round 1 Player 1 offered me one unit of item 4 and in round 2 they offered me one unit of item 4, and in round 1 I offered them no units of Item 4, so it seems like they are also valuing this item quite a bit. In round 1, they only offered me one unit of item 3, and in round 2 they offered me 2 units of item 3. So maybe I can try and get more units of item 3 without giving away my best items?\n\nLet's make a counteroffer where I give them slightly more item 1 and slightly more item 3 in order to see their reaction. I need to keep enough item 1 to remain above my outside option value.\n\nI need to decide what is the bare minimum they would accept.\nIf I were in their situation, I would walk. My outside offer is better than accepting, but they might have a higher outside offer, and they might accept. It's better to walk.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nIf I accept now, I get 139.\nIf I walk away, I get 586.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I need to give Player 1 enough to make them prefer my offer over walking away. Let's try to offer Player 1 something that gives them a little over their minimum, and keep most valuable items for myself.\nHere's how I could think about it:\n*   **Item 2:** Player 1 gets 1. I value it at 80, so they are getting all of it.\n*   **Item 3:** Player 1 gets 2. I value it at 69, so they are getting all of it.\n\nMy potential counteroffer must give Player 1 enough that they will take it into Round 2, instead of just walking away and taking their outside offer.\n\nSince this is round 1, if I counteroffer, the next round will be discounted by 0.9.

Still not better than walking.\n\nLet's propose a more favorable offer for myself, giving Player 1 [4,1,2,3,3]. This gives me [3,0,0,2,0].

I want to maximize my value, so I should aim for an offer that gives me significantly more than 184, hopefully more than 533. I should also consider that Player 1 has their own private values and will be looking to maximize their own value. The challenge is to make an offer that is appealing to Player 1 while still giving me a good outcome.\n\nIn round 1, the discount factor isn't in play yet. Let's try to get an offer that gives me at least my outside option value.\n\nThe total number of each item is:\n- Item 1: 6\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 6\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 1\n\nLet's create a counteroffer where I keep most of the high-value items for myself and offer Player 1 mostly low-value items. Let's try offering Player 1:\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 6 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\nWhich is the exact offer I received. So I need to change that.\n\nLet's try to make them accept something. Let's give them half item 1, all item 2, and all item 4.\nOffer to Player 1: [3, 2, 0, 2, 0]\nI keep: [3, 0, 6, 0, 1]\nMy value: 3*46 + 0*53 + 6*23 + 0*79 + 1*84 = 138 + 0 + 138 + 0 + 84 = 360\n\nStill less than my outside offer. Let's try a more aggressive strategy:\nI'll offer player 1 only 1 unit of item 1, nothing else.\nOffer to player 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nI keep: [5, 2, 6, 2, 1]\nMy value: 5*46 + 2*53 + 6*23 + 2*79 + 1*84 = 230 + 106 + 138 + 158 + 84 = 716\n\nThat is more than my outside offer, but is it worth it to risk walking away?

Therefore, walking away is not a good option.\n*   I need to consider if I can get an even *better* deal by making a counteroffer. It depends on Player 1's values, which I don't know.\n*   Given that the current offer is quite favorable, risking a walk in round 3 by making a counteroffer is not a good idea.\n\n**Decision**\n\nThe current offer is already very good, exceeding my outside offer.

I assume Player 2 might have different values, so the offer must still be attractive:\n\n1. **Item 1:** Offer 1 unit (retain 3 units)\n2. **Item 2:** Offer 0 units (retain 2 units)\n3. **Item 3:** Offer 1 unit (retain 2 units)\n4. **Item 4:** Offer 1 unit (retain 2 units)\n5. **Item 5:** Offer 2 units (retain 2 units)\n\n### Value Calculation\n- Retained Items: \n  - **Item 1:** 3 units for 123 value\n  - **Item 2:** 2 units for 120 value\n  - **Item 3:** 2 units for 78 value\n  - **Item 4:** 2 units for 108 value\n  - **Item 5:** 2 units for 86 value\n\n- Retained Value = 123 + 120 + 78 + 108 + 86 = 515\n\nComparing 515 to my outside offer (498):\n\n- Retained Value (without discount): 515\n- This is higher than 498, suitable for a fair initial offer.\n\nTherefore, the initial offer is designed to maximize my value while staying realistic for player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

I also need to consider the possibility of making a counteroffer that would lead to a better outcome.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. To determine a reasonable counteroffer, I need to estimate the range of possible values Player 1 might have for each item. Since the values are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101, I will consider a range of possibilities.\n\nIf I were to offer Player 1 items such that their value is higher than their outside offer, they would be more inclined to accept. However, without knowing their values, it's hard to find a counteroffer that is guaranteed to be accepted and that would provide me with more than 915 * 0.9 = 823.5.\n\nGiven the high outside offer value and that it is the first round of negotiation with a discount factor of 0.9, it is advantageous for me to aim for a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I keep more of items 3 and 5, since my valuation is higher than Items 1, 2, and 4. For Player 1 to consider accepting the counteroffer, I will offer slightly more of Items 1, 2, and 4.\n\nI will offer Player 1 [2, 3, 0, 2, 0]. This means I keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]. The value of what I keep will be (2*76)+(2*75)+(2*86)+(2*51)+(1*72) = 152+150+172+102+72 = 648. Given this value is much less than my outside offer discounted, I will try for a better offer.\n\nConsider an offer to Player 1 of [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means I keep [3, 4, 2, 3, 1]. My valuation is (3*76)+(4*75)+(2*86)+(3*51)+(1*72) = 228+300+172+153+72=925.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer to Player 1 of [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep [4, 4, 2, 4, 1] and my valuation is (4*76)+(4*75)+(2*86)+(4*51)+(1*72) = 304+300+172+204+72 = 1052. This still gives Player 1 a value, but it does not offer enough to guarantee that they will accept it.\n\nGiven I only have three rounds, and my outside offer is so high, it makes sense to try to get the best deal possible in round 1. Therefore, I should make a counteroffer that favors me. I think [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] is a reasonable offer that might be accepted.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

To improve upon my outside offer, I need to get an agreement better than 931. Let's consider offering them something that is close to maximizing their return.\n\nThe maximum value Player 1 can get is (assuming their values are all 101): 2*101 + 5*101 + 5*101 + 6*101 = 18*101 = 1818. This number is irrelevant.\n\nLet's try to construct an offer that gives me at least 931 / 0.9 = 1034.44 in round 2, or 931 / (0.9^2) = 1149.38 in round 3. That means I need to get a better offer than currently available.\nGiven that the current value of the offer is 296, I can make an offer such that I receive items with combined value just slightly above 931 in my estimation.\n\nHere is my plan: I want to give away items that I value the least and retain those that I value the most.\nSince item 4 has the lowest value, I would be willing to give up all 5 units.\nItem 2 also has a relatively low value, I would be willing to give up a few units of it as well.\nItem 5 has a slightly higher value. Items 1 and 3 are the ones with the highest value.\n\nLet's offer Player 1:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 5 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nValue to me: 5 * 36 + 2 * 43 = 180 + 86 = 266\nThis is lower than the current offer. Let's try another offer.\nI'll offer:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 unit of item 2\n- 3 unit of item 3\n- 3 unit of item 4\n- 3 unit of item 5\nThat leaves me with:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 3 unit of item 2\n- 2 unit of item 3\n- 2 unit of item 4\n- 3 unit of item 5\nValue to me: 62 + 3*36 + 2*72 + 2*10 + 3*43 = 62 + 108 + 144 + 20 + 129 = 463\n\nThis is also low. Let's offer:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1, giving myself everything.\nValue to me = 62*2 + 36*5 + 72*5 + 10*5 + 43*6 = 124 + 180 + 360 + 50 + 258 = 972\n\nLet's offer them:\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nValue to me = 62*2 + 36*4 + 72*4 + 10*4 + 43*5 = 124 + 144 + 288 + 40 + 215 = 811.\nStill low.\n\nLet's WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Also, I have to keep in mind the discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9.\n\nNow, I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. The aim is to maximize my value while making a reasonable offer to Player 2 so that they might accept it or counteroffer with a favorable adjustment for me. \n\nLet's assume Player 2 might value each item differently, but they are incentivized to get something above their alternative offer value. My aim is to remain above my outside offer value and potentially test how much they value some items in the first offer.\n\nIf I make an offer which gives minimal high-value items to Player 2, I can gauge their response (if they accept or counter) in upcoming rounds:\n\n- Give 0 units of item 1 to Player 2 (value to me 0 \u00d7 48 = 0)\n- Give 0 units of item 2 to Player 2 (value to me 0 \u00d7 20 = 0)\n- Give 1 unit of item 3 to Player 2 (value to me 1 \u00d7 68 = 68)\n- Give 2 units of item 4 to Player 2 (value to me 2 \u00d7 32 = 64)\n- Give 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2 (value to me 1 \u00d7 67 = 67)\n\nValue to me = 664 - (68 + 64 + 67) = 465\n\nThis offer value is significantly above my outside offer value and gives me the leverage to see how Player 2 reacts.

If we go to round 3, my potential value is multiplied by 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81.\n\n**Comparison with Outside Offer**\n\nMy outside offer is worth 974. This is a high outside offer, which means I need a reasonably good deal to accept.\n\n**Analyzing Player 1's Offer Strategy**\n\nPlayer 1 is likely trying to get as much as possible. The initial offer suggests they are starting low to see how I react.\n\n**Developing a Counteroffer Strategy**\n\nI need to determine if making a counteroffer is worthwhile. The goal is to get a deal that is significantly better than 301, especially given the relatively strong outside option of 974.\n\n**Round 3 Considerations:**\nSince this is round 1, it is a long way until round 3. If I make a counteroffer now, there is a chance to get to a deal with a higher value at 90% the value now.\nIf I make a bad counteroffer, I will walk away at round 3.\n\n**Decision**\n\nThe current offer of 301 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 974. I will make a counteroffer that significantly increases my payout.\nI will offer Player 1 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.

The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 1's current offer:\n(2 * 87) + (3 * 4) + (3 * 28) + (1 * 68) + (2 * 13) = 174 + 12 + 84 + 68 + 26 = 364\n\nSince this is round 2, we need to multiply this value by the discount factor 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the discounted value of the offer is 364 * 0.9 = 327.6\n\nNow, let's compare this to my outside offer of 974. It's clear that accepting the current offer is significantly worse than walking away.\n\nHowever, before walking away, let's consider if there's a reasonable counteroffer I can make. To make this worthwhile, I need to consider what Player 1 might accept. I don't know Player 1's values, but I can reason about it based on the history of offers.\n\nIn round 1, Player 1 offered [1, 2, 4, 1, 2]. I countered with [7, 4, 1, 0, 2]. This suggests Player 1 values items 3 and 4 more highly than I do. Player 1's current offer is [2, 3, 3, 1, 2].\n\nLet's think about how I would divide the items if Player 1's values were equal to mine.  Total items: [8, 6, 5, 2, 4]\nMy values: [87, 4, 28, 68, 13]\n\nI want to maximize my profit. I know my outside option is 974. If I divide the items to myself and receive value such that (discounted) profit is close to 974, then Player 1 must receive enough value. So an offer that favors me would be unlikely to be accepted.\n\nSince I don't know Player 1's values, and the current offer is far below my outside offer, and it's round 2, I'm going to walk away. There is not enough time to find an agreeable solution.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer on the table. I am being offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 1] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My values for these items are 64, 10, 62, 30, and 87. Therefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n\n(1 * 64) + (1 * 10) + (2 * 62) + (0 * 30) + (1 * 87) = 64 + 10 + 124 + 0 + 87 = 285\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. Thus, the present value of accepting this offer is 285.\n\nMy outside offer is 356. Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\nHowever, this is only the first round. I need to consider whether I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer. The total amount of each item available is 4, 3, 6, 1, 3. This means that if I offer Player 1 x units of item 1, I will have 4-x units of item 1. Similarly for all the items.\nI need to leave Player 1 with a deal they want. The maximum Player 1 could value all the items is 101*(4+3+6+1+3)= 101 * 17 = 1717. Player 1 also has an outside option. Let us assume that the discount rate also applies to the outside option. If I offer too little, then they will just walk, and we will both get our outside options.\n\nI can only make a counteroffer in this round. If Player 1 rejects it, the negotiation concludes and we both walk with our outside offers.\n\nI want to make a counteroffer that is attractive to Player 1, while still giving me a value higher than my outside offer. I should give Player 1 the items that I value the least, and keep the items that I value the most. The order of my valuation is: item 5 > item 1 > item 3 > item 4 > item 2.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1 [3, 2, 4, 1, 2]. This would leave me with [1, 1, 2, 0, 1] and a value of 285. Let's consider what would give me 357. It is not clear what the outside value is for Player 1, but if the outside option is not discounted, then I should aim to extract as much value as possible this round to beat Player 1 walking with their full outside value.\nHowever, I don't know Player 1's values, so it is difficult to determine what is the optimal counteroffer. A good heuristic to follow is to leave them slightly more value than the existing offer, scaled by the discount rate. I can try to exploit the round 1 offer given.\nPlayer 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 1] to me. That means Player 1 is keeping [3, 2, 4, 1, 2]. Let's create an alternative counteroffer and keep some items that I value, say [3, 3, 6, 1, 3].\nThis leaves me with value 0, which is bad.\n\nMy current offer is 285, and my outside option is 356. I want at least to beat the outside option at the cost of the discount rate. So a good heuristic to start with is to ask them to offer me the items that I really value.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer. Let's offer Player 1 the following: [3, 2, 4, 1, 2]. This implies Player 2 has: [1, 1, 2, 0, 1], with value 285.\nLet's try Player 1 values the items at 50 each on average. So 3+2+4+1+2=12. 12*50 = 600. If their outside value is <600, then perhaps they will bite.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 4, 1, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer. The offer on the table is [1, 1, 0, 2, 0], meaning I get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy values for these items are 88, 6, 21, 58, and 44, respectively. So, the value of this offer to me is:\n\n(1 * 88) + (1 * 6) + (0 * 21) + (2 * 58) + (0 * 44) = 88 + 6 + 0 + 116 + 0 = 210\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. Therefore, the present value of this offer to me is 210.\n\nMy outside offer is 67. So, if I walk away, I get 67.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible actions:\n\n1.  **ACCEPT:** I get 210.\n2.  **WALK:** I get 67.\n3.  **COUNTEROFFER:** This is more complex. I need to consider what Player 1 might accept and how the discount factor will affect the value in later rounds.\n\nSince 210 is much greater than my outside option of 67, it seems likely that Player 1 is also getting a good deal. Before countering, I need to consider what I could realistically achieve in a counteroffer. Let's consider a counteroffer that would give me slightly more value than the current offer while still giving player 1 an incentive to accept. Also considering that if I offer too little, I risk them walking.\n\nI will aim for a deal where I get roughly 60% of the total value I can obtain.\nHere is how the total items are distributed:\nitem 1: 4 units\nitem 2: 3 units\nitem 3: 1 unit\nitem 4: 2 units\nitem 5: 5 units\n\nMy values are: 88 for item 1, 6 for item 2, 21 for item 3, 58 for item 4, 44 for item 5.\nTotal value I can get is (4*88)+(3*6)+(1*21)+(2*58)+(5*44) = 352+18+21+116+220 = 727\n\nI am getting 210 from the current offer.\n\nI would prefer to get around 60% of 727 which is ~436. Let's make an offer where Player 1 gets item 2 (3 units), and a share of item 5.\n\nOffer: [4, 0, 0, 2, 3] - this means they get 4 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. My value then is:\n\n(0 * 88) + (3 * 6) + (1 * 21) + (0 * 58) + (2 * 44) = 0 + 18 + 21 + 0 + 88 = 127\n\nThis means the offer I give to Player 1 is more likely to be accepted (as I am left with very little value).\n\nTo get to my target 436, I want Player 1 to get less of item 1 and more of other items (if possible). Let's go with the following.\nOffer: [1, 0, 1, 0, 3] - This gives them one of item 1, zero of item 2, one of item 3, zero of item 4, and 3 of item 5\n\nMy value is (3 * 88) + (3 * 6) + (0 * 21) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 44) = 264+18+0+116+88 = 486\nIf I make a counteroffer it needs to be more attractive than my outside option but still worth the risk of rejecting. I am better off accepting what I am offered because I end up with more value for myself.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n",

Therefore, I need to make a counteroffer that is high enough that I don't walk away.\n\nMy goal is to get at least my outside option value, and I need to consider that Player 1 also has an outside option.\n\nLet's try to get at least half of the total value while considering my outside option. Half of the value is 658/2 = 329. I want to make a counteroffer that gives me at least 492. If the counteroffer is rejected, I get 492 (my outside offer). If the counteroffer is accepted, I get at least that much too.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I give Player 1 the minimum amount to make the deal potentially worthwhile for them, but still give myself a large amount.\nI propose giving Player 1: [4, 0, 4, 2, 4].\n\nThe value for me if this offer is accepted is:\n(1*61) + (1*42) + (1*19) + (1*17) + (1*33) = 61 + 42 + 19 + 17 + 33 = 172.\n\nThis offer seems too aggressive, and would likely be rejected. I should aim for getting value close to my outside option.\n\nThe current offer gives me 272. Let's aim to get at least 492 after the first round. This difference is 492 - 272 = 220. I should ask for more.\n\nLet's try a different approach. I give Player 1 about half of the low-valued items, and try to keep most of high-valued items. I can offer Player 1: [2, 0, 3, 1, 2].\nThis means I keep [3, 1, 2, 2, 3], which gives me value:\n(3*61) + (1*42) + (2*19) + (2*17) + (3*33) = 183 + 42 + 38 + 34 + 99 = 396.\nThis is still lower than my outside option. I should reject this offer if it's the final offer.\n\nLet's counter with an offer such that both players get roughly equal value, and higher than our outside option. Let's consider giving player 1 [2,0,2,1,2]. I keep [3,1,3,2,3]. This leads to (3*61) + (1*42) + (3*19) + (2*17) + (3*33) = 183 + 42 + 57 + 34 + 99 = 415. I should walk away.\n\nHowever, let's try to get closer to my outside option of 492.\nLet's give them [1, 0, 2, 0, 1].\nThen I have [4, 1, 3, 3, 4]. Then my value becomes:\n(4*61) + (1*42) + (3*19) + (3*17) + (4*33) = 244 + 42 + 57 + 51 + 132 = 526.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]}\n",

Thus, the present value of the current offer is 88 * 0.9 = 79.2.\n\nMy outside offer is 492. This is also discounted by 0.9 in round 2, so the present value of walking away is 492 * 0.9 = 442.8.\n\nClearly, accepting the current offer is far worse than walking away. I need to consider making a counteroffer. The goal is to find a counteroffer that Player 1 is likely to accept, and that gives me a better value than walking away.\n\nLet's analyze the items. I have:\n- 5 units of item 1 (value 61)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (value 42)\n- 5 units of item 3 (value 19)\n- 3 units of item 4 (value 17)\n- 5 units of item 5 (value 33)\n\nThe current offer gives me: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\nPlayer 1 currently has offered: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]\nPrevious offers were: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]; I offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\nI want to give Player 1 as little value as possible while still getting them to accept.\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\nThis means I would get 3 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. My value would be (3 * 61) + (0 * 42) + (4 * 19) + (1 * 17) + (3 * 33) = 183 + 0 + 76 + 17 + 99 = 375.\nDiscounted by 0.9, this is 375 * 0.9 = 337.5. Still worse than walking away (442.8).\n\nI need to be more aggressive and risk the walk away.\n\nI'll offer Player 1 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\nThat gives me: 4 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\nMy value is (4 * 61) + (0 * 42) + (4 * 19) + (2 * 17) + (4 * 33) = 244 + 0 + 76 + 34 + 132 = 486.\nDiscounted by 0.9, this is 486 * 0.9 = 437.4. Still worse than walking away (442.8), but getting close.\n\nTo surpass walking away, I need to extract even more. This is very risky.\n\nLet's go for the minimum I can offer Player 1: 0 of each item except item 2. If I give them 1 of item 2, then I end up with value:\n5 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\nThat's (5 * 61) + (0 * 42) + (5 * 19) + (3 * 17) + (5 * 33) = 305 + 0 + 95 + 51 + 165 = 616.\nDiscounted by 0.9, this is 616 * 0.9 = 554.4.

This means, for me to accept any deal in round 1, I would need to ensure that my share of the items exceeds this value since there is no immediate discount factor in play.\n\nI need to offer Player 2 less value than 172, as 973 - 801 = 172. Within this constraint, I'm aiming to maximize my own value while ensuring fairness could still potentially attract acceptance from Player 2.\n\nGiven that:\n- Item 1 and Item 2 have the highest values for me; I want to keep most of these.\n- Item 3 and Item 4 have moderate value, so I could give more of these away.\n- Item 5 has the lowest value, so I can consider giving it to Player 2.\n\nA reasonable initial offer might be:\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 1 to Player 2, keeping 3 for myself.\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 2 to Player 2, keeping 3 for myself.\n- Offer 3 units of Item 3 to Player 2, keeping 2 for myself.\n- Offer 4 units of Item 4 to Player 2, keeping 1 for myself.\n- Offer the single unit of Item 5 to Player 2, as it's negligible to me.\n\nThis offer would translate to [1, 1, 3, 4, 1].\n\nNow let's calculate my retained value:\n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 73 value/unit = 219\n- Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 78 value/unit = 234\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 34 value/unit = 68\n- Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 34 value/unit = 34\n- Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 29 value/unit = 0\n\nValue from this split = 219 + 234 + 68 + 34 + 0 = 555\n\nSince 555 is substantially lower than my outside offer value of 801, I will revise the offer slightly to try and capture more value:\n\nOffer:\n- 2 units of Item 3 to Player 2, keeping 3 for myself.\n- Keep more units of Item 4 as they have more value to me.\n\nRevised offer: [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n\nRevised retained value:\n- Item 1: 3 x 73 = 219\n- Item 2: 3 x 78 = 234\n- Item 3: 3 x 34 = 102\n- Item 4: 3 x 34 = 102\n- Item 5: 0\n\nTotal: 219 + 234 + 102 + 102 + 0 = 657\n\nThis is still below 801, but an aggressive first offer to anchor the negotiation.\n\nGiven the constraints and considering potential negotiations in further rounds, my offer to Player 2 will be:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]}",

As such, if my share of the negotiated outcome (after adjustments for the discount factor) is less than 118, I should prefer to WALK.\n\n3. **Initial Offer Strategy:**  \n   - I need to propose a division of items that provides a value greater than 118 for me while still being potentially attractive to Player 2.  \n   - A fair approach would be to initially offer quantities that allow Player 2 to perceive some value, encouraging negotiation while aiming for a total value higher than my outside offer for me.\n\n4. **Strategic Proposal:**  \n   - Items with high value to me: Item 3 and Item 4.\n   - Items with relatively low value to me: Item 5 and to a lesser extent, Item 2.\n   - Compromise on Item 1 might be needed as it's moderate value.  \n\nI will aim for around 450-500 in value for myself initially, leaving room for adjustments and counter-negotiation later:\n\n- **Offer:**\n  - Offer more of Item 5 and some of Item 2 to Player 2 as these are least valuable for me.\n  - Keep a larger share of Item 3 and Item 4 for myself due to high valuation per unit.\n\nLet's propose an allocation:\n- Item 1: 2 units to Player 2 (4 units for me)\n- Item 2: 1 unit to Player 2 (1 unit for me)\n- Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2 (2 units for me)\n- Item 4: 2 units to Player 2 (4 units for me)\n- Item 5: 2 units to Player 2 (2 units for me)\n\nThe reasoning here is to make a proposal that gives me substantial value while still offering Player 2 something of potential appeal. \n\nNow, we'll calculate the value:\n\n- My items:  \n  - Item 1: 4 units * 39 = 156  \n  - Item 2: 1 unit * 3 = 3  \n  - Item 3: 2 units * 96 = 192  \n  - Item 4: 4 units * 73 = 292  \n  - Item 5: 2 units * 1 = 2  \n  My Total Value: 156 + 3 + 192 + 292 + 2 = 645  \n\n645 is greater than my outside offer value of 118.

My private values are [31, 98, 42, 20, 78]. So the value of this offer to me is:\n\n(2 * 31) + (1 * 98) + (1 * 42) + (2 * 20) + (2 * 78) = 62 + 98 + 42 + 40 + 156 = 398\n\nMy outside offer is 773. Since 398 is significantly less than 773, accepting the offer would be a bad choice.\n\nI have two other options: WALK or COUNTEROFFER. If I walk, I get 773. If I counteroffer, there's a chance we reach a better deal in the next rounds, but it's also possible Player 1 walks away.\n\nSince it is round 1, there are two rounds remaining with a discount factor of 0.9 per round. Therefore, there's time for another offer.\n\nLet's consider the total number of items: 6 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 6 of item 4 and 4 of item 5.\n\nTo formulate a reasonable counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might value. I don't know their values, but I can assume they also want to maximize their utility. A good starting point is to aim for a split that's better for me than my outside offer, and reasonable enough for Player 1 to consider.\n\nLet's try to get at least 430 from the deal to beat my outside offer of 773 considering the discount of 0.9 applies on any following rounds. I will need more than 430/0.9 = 477.7 value to rationally consider continuing after this round. My ideal split would give me close to 773 this round. Since I am making the first offer, I should consider that and make it aggressive enough, but not too aggressive for the player to walk.\n\nI will make an offer to Player 1 where they receive:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 2\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 2\nThis is the offer currently on the table. My values with this breakdown as stated above will be equal to 398. This is less than my outside option. So a more generous offer for myself would be more appropriate.\n\nLet's offer player 1:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 1\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 3\n\nMy value for this new breakdown is:\n(3 * 31) + (2 * 98) + (2 * 42) + (3 * 20) + (3 * 78) = 93 + 196 + 84 + 60 + 234 = 667\n\nThis is lower than my outside option of 773.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I have the outside option. In this case, anything above 0 would be an option for the other player. Let's provide an aggressive counteroffer of :\n\nPlayer 1 gets:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 0\n\nLeaving me with:\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 4\nWhich is (5 * 31) + (2 * 98) + (3 * 42) + (5 * 20) + (4 * 78) = 155 + 196 + 126 + 100 + 312 = 889\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 773 and still gives Player 1 a positive value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

It's round 2, and Player 1 has just offered me [2, 0, 0, 1, 0] (meaning 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5). My outside offer is 773, and my values for each item are 31, 98, 42, 20, and 78 respectively. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of Player 1's current offer to me:\n(2 * 31) + (0 * 98) + (0 * 42) + (1 * 20) + (0 * 78) = 62 + 0 + 0 + 20 + 0 = 82\n\nSince it's round 2, this value needs to be discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of the current offer is 82 * 0.9 = 73.8\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 773. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a bad move.\n\nNow, I need to consider making a counteroffer or walking away. If I make a counteroffer in round 2, and it's rejected, I will get my outside offer in the next round, which is 773, discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81. That would give me a value of 773*0.81 = 626.1\n\nI want to find an offer that Player 1 would accept, that also is better than my outside offer.\n\nSince I have to give Player 1 the items, I should give Player 1 items for which I have the lowest valuation and keep for myself the items for which I have the highest valuation. My valuations are 31, 98, 42, 20, 78.\n\nItem 4 has the lowest value (20), and I have 6 units of it. Item 1 also has a lower value (31), and I have 6 units of it. The other player has a higher number of item 1 and item 4 in their offer, so they probably value these items more.\nMy most valuable items are item 2 (98) and item 5 (78).\n\nLet's consider making an offer close to what they have offered me in round 1, discounted:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 2] to Player 2, so I offered [6-2, 2-1, 3-1, 6-2, 4-2] = [4, 1, 2, 4, 2] to Player 1\nSo the value to player 1 = 4*val(1) + 1*val(2) + 2*val(3) + 4*val(4) + 2*val(5) where val are player 1 values which I do not know.\n\nNow lets try to create an offer that will give me slightly more than my outside offer. The maximum I can get is 940. Let's target a value close to that after discounting. 773/0.9 = 858.8. We should offer them an amount which leaves us a value of 858.8. My strategy should be to give items that I value low, and take items that I value high.\n\nLet's try to offer Player 1 all of item 1, item 3, and item 4, and 2 units of item 5. I would keep item 2 for myself (2 units). And I keep all of item 5. So, my offer is [6, 0, 3, 6, 2].\nMy value for this is 2*98+2*78 = 196+156 = 352. Which is less than 773.\n\nSince it's round 2, and my current offer is significantly below my outside option, I am better off walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Here\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding my values**: \n   - Item 1: 3 units, value per unit = 46, total value = 3 * 46 = 138\n   - Item 2: 5 units, value per unit = 82, total value = 5 * 82 = 410\n   - Item 3: 2 units, value per unit = 46, total value = 2 * 46 = 92\n   - Item 4: 2 units, value per unit = 87, total value = 2 * 87 = 174\n   - Item 5: 7 units, value per unit = 37, total value = 7 * 37 = 259\n   - Total potential value of all items = 138 + 410 + 92 + 174 + 259 = 1073\n\n2. **Outside offer**: My outside offer is 536. This means I should not accept an offer or make a final decision that gives me less than this value.\n\n3. **Negotiation dynamics**:\n   - There are 3 rounds, and we are currently in round 1. \n   - The discount rate (gamma) is 0.9, which affects the valuation in subsequent rounds.\n   - I must consider an initial offer that maximizes my total value while likely being attractive enough for Player 2 to negotiate further.\n\n4. **Strategic Offering**:\n   - I aim to receive more value than my outside offer, considering the potential discount in value in following rounds.\n   - Since I do not know Player 2's values, a good starting point is to control the high-value items to me while offering a reasonable distribution to itemize their potential acceptance or counter.\n\n5. **Formulating the initial offer**:\n   - I\u2019ll aim to keep a majority of Item 2 (my highest value per unit = 82) and Item 4 (my second highest value per unit = 87).\n   - I'll offer the other player more of lower value/high quantity items to me (like parts of Item 1, 3, and 5) and keep a moderate portion.\n\n**Proposed Offer**:\n- Offer to Player 2: \n   - Item 1: 1 unit \n   - Item 2: 2 units \n   - Item 3: 1 unit \n   - Item 4: 0 units \n   - Item 5: 3 units\n\n- I keep:\n   - Item 1: 2 units \n   - Item 2: 3 units \n   - Item 3: 1 unit \n   - Item 4: 2 units \n   - Item 5: 4 units\n\nThis offer attempts to ensure I keep items with higher personal value and a substantial portion of total possible value, while sharing enough to engage Player 2.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 3]}\n```",

I need to consider what Player 1 might accept and factor in the discount rate.\n\n**Round 1 Analysis:**\n\nSince my outside offer (538) is significantly higher than the current offer (196), accepting is not a good option. Walking away guarantees me 538.\n\nHowever, there's a chance I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 enough to make them prefer my offer over their outside offer.\n\n**Crafting a Counteroffer:**\n\nTo decide if I can do better than walking away, I need to consider the total number of items available:\n\n*   Item 1: 3\n*   Item 2: 5\n*   Item 3: 2\n*   Item 4: 2\n*   Item 5: 7\n\nIf I offer Player 1 x units of each item, I will retain (total units - x) of that item. My goal is to see if there is an allocation of units to Player 1 such that my total value is higher than 538 * 0.9 = 484.2 in the next round (discounted value of my outside offer).\n\nI'm in round 1, so I would get 0.9**(1-1) or 1.0 times the value of my outcome.\n\nIf I don't know Player 1's values, I should not expect to receive the full value of all items.\n\nLet's consider a simple scenario and offer Player 1 very little. I will propose to give them the minimum of each item, let's say I give them nothing:\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nMy value if accepted is: (3 * 61) + (5 * 58) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 58) + (7 * 3) = 183 + 290 + 20 + 116 + 21 = 630.\n\nNow the crucial part is to analyze if this is better than walking away. It is slightly better if I were to receive it right away. However, I have to account for the possibility of a failed negotiation and the potential to receive less than my outside offer in round 2.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the complexity of determining Player 1's values and calculating an optimal counteroffer in such short order, and noting that my current best alternative is to secure my outside offer (538), I should decline the first offer and propose a different offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

My values for these items are 7, 8, 4, 31, and 96. My outside offer is 379. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 1's current offer to me:\n(2 * 7) + (2 * 8) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 31) + (2 * 96) = 14 + 16 + 4 + 0 + 192 = 226\n\nSince 226 is less than my outside offer of 379, accepting this offer would be a bad idea.\n\nNow, let's consider what a reasonable counteroffer might be. My goal is to get at least my outside offer value, 379, after considering the discount factor.\n\nLet's consider the extreme case where I take all of the items. The total value of all the items is (2*7)+(4*8)+(2*4)+(1*31)+(5*96) = 14+32+8+31+480 = 565.\nSince the outside offer to player 1 is drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to Player 1's total value of all items, it's hard to determine if Player 1 will accept my counteroffer.\n\nInstead of trying to calculate the \"perfect\" offer, let's try to improve upon the current offer and see if it's enough.\n\nHere's the key idea: I want to offer the minimum amount to Player 1 such that he/she is happy and I can still get more than my outside option in round 2 if I make an offer in Round 1 that Player 1 does not ACCEPT.\n\nI think making a reasonable counteroffer is better than walking away. I need to offer Player 1 something to induce them to move away from their initial offer.\n\nGiven the above analysis, I'll make a counteroffer that gives a little more of the less valuable items to Player 1. Let's try to improve the current offer for myself.\nPlayer 1's initial offer: [2, 2, 1, 0, 2]\nTotal items: [2, 4, 2, 1, 5]\nItems I give to Player 1: [0, 2, 0, 0, 3]\n\nThis gives me:\n(0 * 7) + (2 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (0 * 31) + (3 * 96) = 0 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 288 = 304 for player 1\nAnd gives Player 2 (me):\n(2 * 7) + (2 * 8) + (2 * 4) + (1 * 31) + (2 * 96) = 14 + 16 + 8 + 31 + 192 = 261 for me\n\nThis is better than the previous offer of 226, but still less than my outside offer of 379.\n\nNow, if my counteroffer is refused by Player 1, the effective outside offer value for me in round 2 will be 379 * 0.9 = 341.1\n\nLet's attempt a more generous counteroffer for myself.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 0, 3]}\nThis would give me: (2*7) + (1*8) + (1*4) + (1*31) + (2*96) = 14 + 8 + 4 + 31 + 192 = 249.\nThis is still below my outside offer of 379.\n\nLet's just walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm Player 2, and Player 1 has offered me [1, 2, 0, 1, 1] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My private values are 44, 42, 20, 7, and 71. My outside offer is 277. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 44) + (2 * 42) + (0 * 20) + (1 * 7) + (1 * 71) = 44 + 84 + 0 + 7 + 71 = 206\n\nSince this is round 1, the value of the offer is 206 * (0.9^(1-1)) = 206 * 1 = 206.\n\nNow, let's consider my outside offer, which is 277. Since 206 < 277, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away right now.\n\nHowever, this is round 1, so there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer. To decide on the counteroffer, I need to consider what a good outcome would look like for me and how likely Player 1 is to accept it. I have 4 units of item 1, 7 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 4 of item 5 to distribute between us.\n\nLet's aim for a counteroffer that gives Player 1 just enough to make them prefer accepting it over their unknown outside option. Since I don't know their values, I'll start by offering them a relatively even split, adjusting slightly to keep more of the items I value highly.\n\nI will try to keep as much of items 1 and 5, as they give me high value. Item 4 is of very low value to me, so I can consider offering more of that to Player 1.\nA possible split could be Player 1 gets: [3, 4, 1, 3, 3]. This means I would get [1, 3, 0, 1, 1].\n\nThe value of my counteroffer for me is: (1*44) + (3*42) + (0*20) + (1*7) + (1*71) = 44 + 126 + 0 + 7 + 71 = 248.\nThe discounted value is 248 * 0.9^0 = 248. This is still less than my outside offer of 277, but perhaps Player 1 will be more inclined to accept this deal.\nI need to consider my outside option value of 277 for future rounds. If I make a counteroffer that is likely to be rejected, it will cost me (1-0.9)*277 = 27.7 relative to walking away now.\n\nInstead, let's try to improve my offer.\n\nI need to give away more of my valuable items while keeping the total value above my outside option times the discount factor. The key is that any deal is better than walking away if my valuation is above the discounted value of walking away.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1 the following: [2, 5, 1, 4, 2]\nThat leaves me with [2, 2, 0, 0, 2] which has value (2 * 44) + (2 * 42) + (0 * 20) + (0 * 7) + (2 * 71) = 88 + 84 + 0 + 0 + 142 = 314\n\nThe discounted value is 314 * 0.9^0 = 314. This is greater than my outside offer of 277. This is a much better outcome, so I'll propose this split.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 5, 1, 4, 2]}\n```",

Since this is the first round, I don't need to worry about the discount rate yet as it applies only in the subsequent rounds.\n\nLet's assume an aggressive first offer where I keep most of the high-value items and offer Player 2 a minimal allocation:\n\n- Item 1: I offer 0 units to Player 2 (I keep 3)\n- Item 2: I offer 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3)\n- Item 3: I offer 4 units to Player 2 (I keep 0)\n- Item 4: I offer 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 3)\n- Item 5: I offer 6 units to Player 2 (I keep 5)\n\nCalculate the value of the items I keep:\n\n- Item 1: 3 units * 71 = 213\n- Item 2: 3 units * 100 = 300\n- Item 3: 0 units * 27 = 0\n- Item 4: 3 units * 97 = 291\n- Item 5: 5 units * 18 = 90\n\nTotal value for me = 213 + 300 + 0 + 291 + 90 = 894\n\nSince 894 is greater than my outside offer of 807, this offer leaves me in a better position than the outside offer. I'll present this as my initial offer.\n\nThus, my action is to provide a counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 4, 1, 6]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's break down this negotiation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer on the table. Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 4, 1, 6] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My values for these items are 95, 52, 98, 56, and 21. So, the value of this offer to me is:\n\n(0 * 95) + (1 * 52) + (4 * 98) + (1 * 56) + (6 * 21) = 0 + 52 + 392 + 56 + 126 = 626\n\nNow, I need to consider the discount factor. This is round 1, so the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 0.9^0 = 1. Thus, the present value of accepting this offer is 626 * 1 = 626.\n\nNext, I compare this to my outside offer, which is 106. Since 626 is significantly greater than 106, I shouldn't walk away immediately.\n\nNow, I need to consider making a counteroffer. To decide whether to make a counteroffer, I need to think about how Player 1 might respond. I don't know their values, so I have to make some assumptions. A good strategy is to try and improve my position without being too greedy and causing Player 1 to walk away or reject my offer outright.\n\nI have 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 11 units of item 5. Currently, Player 1 gets:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2 (4 - 1)\n- 0 units of item 3 (4 - 4)\n- 3 units of item 4 (4 - 1)\n- 5 units of item 5 (11 - 6)\n\nI want to increase my value, but I need to give Player 1 enough to keep them interested. Let's aim for a division that is roughly in my favor.\nI'll propose a counteroffer where I give Player 1:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 unit of item 3\n- 2 unit of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis means I would receive:\n- 2 unit of item 1\n- 2 unit of item 2\n- 2 unit of item 3\n- 2 unit of item 4\n- 8 units of item 5\nMy value for this offer: (2*95) + (2*52) + (2*98) + (2*56) + (8*21) = 190 + 104 + 196 + 112 + 168 = 770\n\nThe offer given to Player 1 has a potential value of 3*101 + 4*101 + 4*101 + 4*101 + 11*101 = 26*101 = 2626. With my counteroffer they would receive 1*101+2*101+2*101+2*101+3*101=10*101=1010. This might be acceptable to Player 1.\n\nSince 770 is better than 626, and significantly better than my outside offer of 106, I'll make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]}\n```",

If I walk away, I get 50.  So accepting is better than walking away *right now*.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1. If I make a counteroffer, there are two more rounds of negotiation. The discount factor is 0.9. Therefore I must weigh the possible gain to be achieved in later rounds against the discount factor. I need to figure out if there's a counteroffer that benefits me and that Player 1 might accept.\n\nSince I have a relatively high value for item 5 and Player 1 is offering me 2 units of item 5, I need to consider how much they value item 5. It is likely they value it relatively highly if they are only giving me 2 units of it. Similarly, I have a low value for item 2 (6) and they are offering me 2 units of item 2. Let's assume they also have a relative low value for item 2.\nI also need to keep in mind that Player 1 has an outside option.\n\nI have 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 3, and 4 units of item 4 to give away. My values for these items are 39, 45, and 21, respectively.\nI want to keep the remaining units of item 5 for myself as they are worth 93 each to me.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer player 1 all of item 1, all of item 3 and all of item 4, but reduce the amount of item 2 and item 5 they get.\n\nHere's the reasoning: Since I value item 5 at 93 and player 1 is already giving me 2 of it, I can assume Player 1 values Item 5 lower than 93. I can expect Player 1 to value item 2 more than me.\n\nLet's try this:\nI offer Player 1: [5, 0, 3, 4, 0]. This means I get [0, 3, 0, 0, 6].\nThe value to me is: 3*6 + 6*93 = 18 + 558 = 576.\nDiscounted in Round 2 it is 576 * 0.9 = 518.4\nDiscounted in Round 3 it is 576 * 0.81 = 466.56.\n\nCompared to 219, 576 is much better.\n\nLet's make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 3, 4, 0]}\n```",

Ensure that the value you retain in the negotiation is significantly higher than your outside offer, considering the discount factor from potential continued negotiations.\n\nSince there are no current offers on the table, you will make the first offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 2, and Player 1 has offered me [0, 3, 0, 2, 1] units of items 1 through 5 respectively. My private values for these items are [79, 62, 36, 94, 5]. My outside offer is 994, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(0 * 79) + (3 * 62) + (0 * 36) + (2 * 94) + (1 * 5) = 0 + 186 + 0 + 188 + 5 = 379\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of each action:\n\n*   **ACCEPT:** I receive a value of 379.\n*   **WALK:** I receive my outside offer of 994.\n*   **COUNTEROFFER:** This starts another round of negotiation. If we reach an agreement in round 2, my payoff will be discounted by 0.9. If we reach an agreement in round 3, my payoff will be discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\nSince my outside offer (994) is significantly higher than the value of the current offer (379), accepting is not a good option. To decide between WALKING and making a COUNTEROFFER, I need to consider what I think Player 1 might accept.\n\nLet's calculate my total value for all items:\n(4 * 79) + (6 * 62) + (3 * 36) + (5 * 94) + (3 * 5) = 316 + 372 + 108 + 470 + 15 = 1281\n\nI need to determine if there is a counteroffer that I could make that Player 1 might accept and that would be better than walking away with 994. Since I have a higher value for items 1 and 4, I will construct an offer that shifts more of those items to me. It's difficult to know Player 1's values without information, so I will have to make a reasonable guess at an offer. I'll offer Player 1 more of item 2 and item 5 since my values are lower for those.\n\nI could propose the offer where Player 1 gets [3, 4, 3, 3, 2] and I get [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]. This means I give Player 1 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, all 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 2 unit of item 5. However, to make a more informed decision, I should first attempt to make a good offer to see if player 1 accepts.\n\nLet's try the following split, which I will offer to Player 1: [3, 4, 3, 3, 2]. This means I get [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]. The value to me of [1, 2, 0, 2, 1] is (1*79) + (2*62) + (0*36) + (2*94) + (1*5) = 79 + 124 + 0 + 188 + 5 = 396.\nDiscounted value in round 2: 396*0.9 = 356.4\nDiscounted value in round 3: 396*0.81 = 320.76\n\nThis offer is still worse than walking away with 994. However, offering a counteroffer gives the chance of achieving a much better deal. Since this is round 1, I will offer a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 3, 3, 2]}\n",

My private values are [79, 62, 36, 94, 5], and my outside offer is 994. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(1 * 79) + (4 * 62) + (0 * 36) + (2 * 94) + (1 * 5) = 79 + 248 + 0 + 188 + 5 = 520\n\nSince it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So, the present value of the current offer is 520 * 0.9 = 468.\n\nSince 468 < 994 (my outside offer), accepting the offer is worse than walking away right now.\n\nNow, let's analyze the previous round. Player 1 offered me [0, 3, 0, 2, 1] in round 1, and I countered with offering Player 1 [3, 4, 3, 3, 2]. The current offer from player 1 is [1, 4, 0, 2, 1]. Since the current offer is worse than my outside option. I should make a counteroffer that is better than my outside option while also being realistic enough that Player 1 *might* accept.\n\nHere's how I will construct my counteroffer: My total number of each item: [4, 6, 3, 5, 3]. Player 1 gave me [1, 4, 0, 2, 1]. This means they keep [3, 2, 3, 3, 2].\n\nI will try to provide an offer that's slightly better than my walkaway value of 994 (undiscounted) but still attractive for Player 1.  The total value of all the items is 1281.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n\nThis means I get [3, 5, 2, 4, 2].\nMy value would be (3 * 79) + (5 * 62) + (2 * 36) + (4 * 94) + (2 * 5) = 237 + 310 + 72 + 376 + 10 = 1005.\n\n1005 * 0.9 = 904.5\n\nThis value of 904.5 is still not higher than my outside offer of 994. I need to adjust the counteroffer.\n\nLet me try offering Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would get everything, [4, 6, 3, 5, 3], which would be (4*79) + (6*62) + (3*36) + (5*94) + (3*5) = 316 + 372 + 108 + 470 + 15 = 1281. This offer is not acceptable to Player 1.\n\nOkay, let's start with a bare minimum. I need a value of 994 / 0.9 = 1104.44 *now*.\nLet me start with Player 1's current offer [1, 4, 0, 2, 1], valued at 520. I need 1104.44-520 = 584.44 more value. This requires significant changes to the current offer.\nWhat if I countered with offering player 1 [2, 2, 2, 2, 2].\nMy value: [2, 4, 1, 3, 1] which is (2*79) + (4*62) + (1*36) + (3*94) + (1*5) = 158 + 248 + 36 + 282 + 5 = 729.\n729 * 0.9 = 656.1\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [1, 3, 1, 2, 1].  Meaning I keep: [3, 3, 2, 3, 2]. The value I would have is (3*79) + (3*62) + (2*36) + (3*94) + (2*5) = 237+186+72+282+10=787. 787*0.9=708.3\n\nIt's clear that making a deal better than my outside option while giving anything significant to player 1 is not going to work.\n\nGiven these calculations and the fact it is round 2, I'm not optimistic about a deal being reached that is better than my outside offer, especially given the discount factor.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

My strategic choice is to allocate the items based on my private valuation and leave a reserve that makes my take valuable enough compared to my outside offer.\n\n1. **Value Analysis of Strategy**:\n   - Ideally, I will look to keep a significant portion of the items that are high value to me while giving away most of what is lower value.\n   \n2. **Initial Offer**:\n   - Offer 2 out of 3 units of Item 1.\n   - Offer 2 out of 5 units of Item 2.\n   - Offer 0 units of Item 3 (as it's the highest value to me).\n   - Offer 1 out of 4 units of Item 4.\n   - Offer 0 units of Item 5 (as this is also relatively high value to me).\n   \n***Validating Strategy:***\n\n- **Value Calculation for Self** (keeping):\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 11 = 11\n  - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 30 = 90\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 65 = 130\n  - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 34 = 102\n  - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 58 = 174\n  \n  Total retained value = 11 + 90 + 130 + 102 + 174 = 507\n  \n- Accepting in Round 1, I get full value of 507 which is vastly higher than the outside offer of 122, making this deal worth it without any discount impact yet.\n\nBy making this offer, I can justify a strong starting position without immediately resorting to walking away.\n\n### Conclusion\nMaking this offer as an advantageous position, hopeful for negotiation to secure a greater slice of my self-valued items.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 2.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [2, 2, 0, 1, 0], meaning Player 1 is offering me 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are 96 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 94 for item 3, 75 for item 4, and 6 for item 5.\nMy outside offer is 236.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(2 * 96) + (2 * 76) + (0 * 94) + (1 * 75) + (0 * 6) = 192 + 152 + 0 + 75 + 0 = 419\n\nSince 419 is greater than my outside offer of 236, accepting the offer is better than walking away *right now*. However, this is round 1, so I have to consider the discount factor in future rounds and whether I can get a better deal.\n\nThe total number of items: 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n\nMy values are:\nItem 1: 96\nItem 2: 76\nItem 3: 94\nItem 4: 75\nItem 5: 6\n\nIf I were to get everything, my value would be (3*96) + (5*76) + (2*94) + (4*75) + (3*6) = 288 + 380 + 188 + 300 + 18 = 1174\nPlayer 1 offered me [2, 2, 0, 1, 0]. This means they get [1, 3, 2, 3, 3]. Let us evaluate what that deal would be worth to Player 1. We do not know Player 1's values, but we assume that they are making a rational offer to maximize their own gain.\n\nSince I'm trying to maximize my outcome, I should only accept if I cannot achieve more by making a counteroffer.\nLet's think about a counteroffer that benefits me. I want to obtain as much of items 1, 2, 3 and 4 as possible, since those have higher values for me. Item 5 has a very low value, so I don't need much of it.\n\nSince I'm in round 1, and gamma = 0.9, I want to see if a counteroffer would lead to a better outcome, taking into account the discount factor.\nI'm going to make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5. That leaves me with 2 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 0 units of item 5 which results in same deal as the current offer. This counteroffer doesn't improve my standing, so it will not be optimal.\n\nSince the current deal gives me more than my outside option, but there are future rounds, let's make a more aggressive counteroffer. Let's offer Player 1 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4 and 3 units of item 5.\nThis would leave me with 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5. The value for me is (3*96) + (3*76) + (1*94) + (2*75) + (0*6) = 288 + 228 + 94 + 150 + 0 = 760.\n\nLet's compare the two options with discount factors in mind:\n\n1) Accepting the current offer yields 419 in value now.\n2) Counter offering yields 760 * 0.9 if it gets accepted in the second round, or I get 236 if I end up walking away.\n\nSince 760*0.9 = 684, which is much greater than 419, making a counteroffer is the best choice.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

The current offer on the table is [4, 0, 0, 2, 0], meaning Player 1 is offering me 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 66\n- Item 2: 78\n- Item 3: 29\n- Item 4: 19\n- Item 5: 34\n\nMy outside offer is 178.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(4 * 66) + (0 * 78) + (0 * 29) + (2 * 19) + (0 * 34) = 264 + 0 + 0 + 38 + 0 = 302\n\nSince 302 > 178 (my outside offer), accepting the current offer is better than walking away immediately.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1. I have two more rounds to potentially get a better deal, but the discount factor is 0.9.  If I make a counteroffer, Player 1 might accept it next round. If I reject and counteroffer in round 1, and then Player 1 rejects that counteroffer, my final counteroffer (which will be treated as a walk) will get discounted.\n\nLet's consider the maximum possible value I could get. Player 1 has offered me [4, 0, 0, 2, 0]. There are 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5 to divide. This means Player 1 is keeping 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5.\n\nTo decide on a reasonable counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 *might* value each item at. Since the values are drawn from a uniform random distribution from 1 to 101, on average their value should be about 50.\n\nMy value for the items is:\n- Item 1: 66\n- Item 2: 78\n- Item 3: 29\n- Item 4: 19\n- Item 5: 34\n\nI want to maximize my value, so I want to acquire as much of items 1, 2, and 5 as possible, but not at the expense of other more valuable items. Items 3 and 4 are not valuable to me.\n\nGiven the current offer and the fact it is better than my outside option, I should try to improve the offer. I can try to trade item 3 or 4 for a bit of items 1, 2, or 5.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 the full amount of item 3 and giving them back item 4 in exchange for item 1:\nI offer [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] to Player 1. That means I request [5, 1, 0, 3, 2]. The value to me of [5, 1, 0, 3, 2] is (5 * 66) + (1 * 78) + (0 * 29) + (3 * 19) + (2 * 34) = 330 + 78 + 0 + 57 + 68 = 533\nNow I offer [1, 0, 3, 1, 2].\nValue to me is 66*4 + 78*1 + 29*0 + 19*2 + 34*0 = 264 + 78 + 38 = 380.\n\nOkay, let's try a slightly more conservative approach and ask for just one item 1 in return for an item 4.\nI offer [3, 0, 0, 3, 0] to Player 1, receiving [2, 1, 3, 0, 2]. The value is (2 * 66) + (1 * 78) + (3 * 29) + (0 * 19) + (2 * 34) = 132 + 78 + 87 + 0 + 68 = 365.\n\nI think I'll go with that, which is a conservative increase, as player 1 might not be happy to lose an item 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

Let's consider a counteroffer.\nThe current offer is pretty decent, it's already above my outside option.\nIf I counteroffer, I'll be giving Player 1 more items and keeping less for myself.\nSince the offer of 800 is not so far from my outside option of 779, I should try to get more. If I am too greedy I risk the negotiation falling through. \n\nLet's try offering Player 1 a little more to see if I can secure a slightly better deal.\n\nThe values offered to me were [1, 1, 1, 1, 5]. This means that Player 1 would get [5, 4, 3, 1, 1].\n\nLet's offer Player 1 [4, 3, 2, 0, 0]. This would leave me with [2, 2, 2, 2, 6].\nValue to me = (2 * 71) + (2 * 97) + (2 * 94) + (2 * 78) + (6 * 92) = 142 + 194 + 188 + 156 + 552 = 1232. Discounted this would be 1232*0.9 = 1108.8 in round 2.\nSince this looks risky, it might be safer to accept the original offer.\n\nI will make a slight counteroffer. I'll offer [5, 4, 3, 1, 0]. That would give me a value of [1, 1, 1, 1, 6] = 71+97+94+78+6*92 = 71+97+94+78+552=892.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 4, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

If I walk away, I only secure my outside offer value which is 218. Maximize the item allocation in a way that significantly exceeds my next best alternative.\n\n**Evaluate the Current Counteroffer from Player 2:**\n\nPlayer 2's counter involves giving more of item 1, 2, and 3 to me, which are quite valuable to me. Notably, offering 5 units for item 1 maximizes my opportunity since item 1 alone is highly valuable to me.\n\nIf I don't accept this and instead make a counteroffer, I need to ensure a higher outcome value adjusted for round 3 if Player 2 rejects my counter. \n\n**Participants' Values:**\n- Items given to Player 2 in the original offer were valued less significantly, as I primarily opted to hold onto item 5 with more strategic release. There is no guarantee I can obtain a better set than 921.6 based on visible distribution thus far.\n\nGiven these considerations and the significant value the current offer brings, accepting the proposal secures a result much better than my outside offer adjusted even for another round's discounted potential.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Accept the deal as it greatly maximizes current utility under these conditions.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and Player 1 has offered me [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], meaning they are offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My values for these items are 46, 52, 37, 68, and 59, respectively. My outside offer is 182. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(0 * 46) + (1 * 52) + (1 * 37) + (1 * 68) + (1 * 59) = 0 + 52 + 37 + 68 + 59 = 216\n\nSince 216 > 182, the current offer is better than my outside offer. However, this is only round 1, and I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.\n\nLet's consider the total number of each item: 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5. Player 1 is currently offering me [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], which means they are keeping [2, 3, 2, 0, 2].\n\nNow, let's consider a possible counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, but I also need to make the offer attractive enough for Player 1 to accept. I should focus on keeping items that I value highly and offering Player 1 items that I value less. Item 4 is my highest valued item, and I'm already getting it all.\n\nHere's a possible strategy: I could try to get more of item 5 since its value is reasonably high. However, offering more item 5 would necessitate giving up more of item 2 or 3. Another possibility is to try and get at least one unit of item 1. Let's see what would happen if I propose to Player 1 that they get all of item 2.\n\nCounteroffer idea: Offer Player 1 [2, 4, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get [0, 0, 2, 1, 3]. My value would then be:\n(0 * 46) + (0 * 52) + (2 * 37) + (1 * 68) + (3 * 59) = 0 + 0 + 74 + 68 + 177 = 319\n319 * 0.9 = 287.1\nHowever, I don't know Player 1's value. Given that the current offer is > 182, and given that there are 2 more rounds, I believe I should counter offer in an attempt to improve my total.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 2, 1, 0, 1] - this means I receive [1, 2, 2, 1, 2] which gives me:\n(1 * 46) + (2 * 52) + (2 * 37) + (1 * 68) + (2 * 59) = 46 + 104 + 74 + 68 + 118 = 410\n410 * 0.9 = 369\nWhile this seems high, if they accept, I don't get another round.\nI think its more useful to counter offer in the hopes of getting at least one round.\n\nLet's stick with the simpler strategy of offering Player 1 what they have currently and adding one more item. I will offer them one more unit of item 2.\n\nMy Counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]. This means that I receive [2, 2, 2, 0, 2]. The value of this is:\n(2*46) + (2*52) + (2*37) + (0*68) + (2*59) = 92 + 104 + 74 + 0 + 118 = 388\n388 * 0.9 = 349.2\n\nThis seems like the best bet for me to play strategically.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

My values for these items are 46, 52, 37, 68, and 59, respectively.\n\nThis offer gives me a value of (0 * 46) + (1 * 52) + (1 * 37) + (1 * 68) + (0 * 59) = 0 + 52 + 37 + 68 + 0 = 157.\n\nSince it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Therefore, the present value of accepting this offer is 157 * 0.9 = 141.3.\n\nMy outside offer is 182. So, if I walk away, I get 182.  Clearly, walking away is better than accepting the current offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer something that Player 1 is likely to accept, but also gives me more than 182 * (1/0.9) = 202.22 value. Since it is round 2, it is unlikely a deal will be made next round, so I should try to maximize my value as much as possible this round.\n\nHere's what I have to work with: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\nThe key items for me are item 4 (value 68) and item 5 (value 59).

My previous counteroffer to them was [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]. Given that player 1 reduced Item 5 to 0, I would assume that they don't value item 5 highly.\n\nLet's think about a counteroffer where I give Player 1 all of item 1 (2 units) and all of item 3 (3 units), and most of item 2 (3 units). They would get [2, 3, 3, 0, 0]. This means I keep 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.

Given there are 3 rounds, ending in round 1 means no discount, ending in round 2 effectively multiplies the value by 0.9, and ending in round 3 multiplies the value by 0.81.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - My goal is to get a deal value greater than my outside offer of 232.\n   \n6. **Initial Offer:**\n   - I can propose an initial offer aiming to secure items that represent at least my outside offer value when discounted for future rounds.\n   \nConsidering the distribution and my values, I'll propose a counteroffer that aims to maximize my value while offering the other player some items likely of lower value to me, especially since I don't know their values.\n\nLet's make a reasonable offer giving fewer high-value items to Player 2:\n\n- I'll offer:\n  - 2 units of Item 1\n  - 2 units of Item 2\n  - 0 units of Item 3\n  - 1 unit of Item 4\n  - 2 units of Item 5\n\nMy value from this offer:\n- My remaining units:\n  - 1 unit of Item 1 (19)\n  - 2 units of Item 2 (30)\n  - 1 unit of Item 3 (44)\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 (78)\n  - 1 unit of Item 5 (11)\n\n- Total value for me = 19 + 30 + 44 + 78 + 11 = 182.\n\nSince this value for me is less than my outside offer, I will propose another counteroffer.

So, the present value of accepting this offer is simply 379.\n\n**Comparing to Outside Offer**\n\nMy outside offer is worth 500.  Since 379 < 500, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n**Formulating a Counteroffer**\n\nI want to get a deal that's better than 500. Let's try to construct a counteroffer that gives Player 1 enough to accept, while maximizing my own value.\n\nI want as much of item 4 as possible (value of 98), then item 2 (value of 89), then item 5 (value of 75), then item 1 (value of 51), then item 3 (value of 45).\n\nTo calculate the value of the items to Player 1, we don't know his exact values, but we can make a reasonable assumption. We know that his values are between 1 and 101. We will assume they are near 51.\n\nLet's consider what I would offer the other player. I need to leave enough so that he doesn't prefer to walk away. \n\nI will try to keep 2 item 4 and 3 item 2, which would give me a lot of value.\n\nHere's my proposed counteroffer (what I'd give to Player 1): [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n**Reasoning for Counteroffer**\n\n*   This offer gives Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This may be enough for him to accept, given that he offered me some value.\n*   I would get 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n**Value of the Counteroffer to Me:**\n\n* Item 1: 2 * 51 = 102\n* Item 2: 3 * 89 = 267\n* Item 3: 0 * 45 = 0\n* Item 4: 2 * 98 = 196\n* Item 5: 3 * 75 = 225\n\nTotal: 102 + 267 + 0 + 196 + 225 = 790\n\nThis is greater than my outside option of 500.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Applying the discount factor for round 1: 790 * 1 = 790\n\nNow, consider the final round. If I reject the current offer, I have one more chance to make a counteroffer, but it's treated as a WALK if Player 1 doesn't accept. Effectively, if I counteroffer I'll get my outside offer. In round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. So, the present value of my outside option in the final round would be 500 * 0.81 = 405.\n\nMy best option seems to be to counteroffer in round 2. I'd need to offer Player 1 something that they would see as more attractive than walking away with their outside offer. I don't know their values, so it's difficult to be certain, but let's try a split that's slightly better for me than equal division based on number of items, while trying to make the total value for myself higher than 405 * (1/0.9) which is about 450 (to beat my walking away and then getting 500 in round 3).\n\nLet's try offering them: [1, 2, 0, 0, 1]. This leaves me with [2, 2, 1, 2, 2].\nMy value would be (2 * 51) + (2 * 89) + (1 * 45) + (2 * 98) + (2 * 75) = 102 + 178 + 45 + 196 + 150 = 671\nThe present value of this is 671 * 0.9 = 603.9. This is better than walking away with 500 in round 3.\n\nGiven the current situation, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n**My values:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 31, Item 3: 9, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 79.\n**Current offer to me:** [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n**My outside offer:** 158\n**Discount factor:** 0.9\n**Round:** 2\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(1 * 7) + (1 * 31) + (2 * 9) + (0 * 3) + (2 * 79) = 7 + 31 + 18 + 0 + 158 = 214\n\nSince it's round 2, the discounted value of this offer is 214 * 0.9 = 192.6. This is greater than my outside offer of 158. So accepting is better than walking away right now.\n\nHowever, before accepting, let's consider a counteroffer. We are in round 2, so if I make a counteroffer and it's not accepted, I walk away in the next round. I want to make a counteroffer that Player 1 is likely to accept, but also increases my value.\n\nPlayer 1's current offer to me is [1, 1, 2, 0, 2], which means they get [3, 1, 2, 2, 2]. Let's look at Player 1's offers from the previous round.\nRound 1 offer to me: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] which means they would get [4, 1, 3, 1, 4].\nMy Round 1 offer to them: [2, 1, 2, 1, 1] which means I would get [2, 1, 2, 1, 3].\nPlayer 1's Round 2 offer to me: [1, 1, 2, 0, 2] which means they would get [3, 1, 2, 2, 2].\n\nIt seems like they value Item 1, Item 4, and Item 5 more than I do. So, I could try to give them a little more of those items and take a little more of Item 2 and Item 3.\n\nLet's try offering them [2, 0, 1, 1, 3]. This means I get [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]. My value would be:\n(2 * 7) + (2 * 31) + (3 * 9) + (1 * 3) + (1 * 79) = 14 + 62 + 27 + 3 + 79 = 185\nThe discounted value would be 185 * 0.9 = 166.5 which is above my outside offer.\n\nLet's also check if I offer them [1, 0, 1, 1, 3], so I get [3, 2, 3, 1, 1]. My value would be:\n(3 * 7) + (2 * 31) + (3 * 9) + (1 * 3) + (1 * 79) = 21 + 62 + 27 + 3 + 79 = 192\nThe discounted value would be 192 * 0.9 = 172.8 which is still above my outside offer.\n\nCompared to the original 192.6 from accepting, the 172.8 discounted value is not much better. Let's try one more offer.\nI offer them [1, 1, 1, 1, 3], so I get [3, 1, 3, 1, 1]. My value would be:\n(3 * 7) + (1 * 31) + (3 * 9) + (1 * 3) + (1 * 79) = 21 + 31 + 27 + 3 + 79 = 161\nThe discounted value would be 161 * 0.9 = 144.9 which is below my outside offer.\n\nIt seems that I value these items quite a bit. Therefore, accepting is the best strategy.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

So the present value of the offer is 133.\n\n**Comparing to My Outside Offer**\n\nThe current offer (133) is less than my outside offer (153). Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer**\n\nI need to decide if there is a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept that is better than my outside offer of 153.\n\n**Reasoning about Player 1's Values**\n\nSince I don't know Player 1's values, the best approach is to make an offer that gives them a reasonable amount of items, while maximizing my own value. We also need to consider the deadline is in three rounds.\n\n**Formulating a Counteroffer**\n\nLet's calculate the maximum possible value I can obtain by keeping everything:\n\n*   1 \\* 60 = 60\n*   2 \\* 50 = 100\n*   1 \\* 42 = 42\n*   4 \\* 5 = 20\n*   2 \\* 73 = 146\n\nTotal: 60 + 100 + 42 + 20 + 146 = 368\n\nNow, I need to decide how much to give Player 1. Given that my value for item 4 is the lowest, I will offer them all the units I have of item 4. Let me see if this is enough. Also, since Player 1 started negotiations, I will assume they want to negotiate, so I don't want to demand too much.\n\nI will counteroffer giving them 4 units of item 4 and nothing else. That is, I will give them [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. Then I will have:\n\n*   1 \\* 60 = 60\n*   2 \\* 50 = 100\n*   1 \\* 42 = 42\n*   0 \\* 5 = 0\n*   2 \\* 73 = 146\nTotal: 60 + 100 + 42 + 0 + 146 = 348\n\n**Decision**\n\nSince 348 > 153, this is a good counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the current state:\n\n*   **Round:** 2\n*   **My values:** item 1: 60, item 2: 50, item 3: 42, item 4: 5, item 5: 73\n*   **My outside offer:** 153\n*   **Current offer to me:** [0, 1, 0, 3, 1]\n*   **Items available:** item 1: 1, item 2: 2, item 3: 1, item 4: 4, item 5: 2\n*   **Gamma:** 0.9\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n\n*   (0 * 60) + (1 * 50) + (0 * 42) + (3 * 5) + (1 * 73) = 0 + 50 + 0 + 15 + 73 = 138\n*   Discounted value: 138 * 0.9^(2-1) = 138 * 0.9 = 124.2\n\nSince 124.2 is less than my outside offer of 153, accepting the current offer is not optimal. I should consider a counteroffer or walking away.\n\nIn the last round, if I make a counteroffer it will be considered as WALK. If I WALK now, I get 153. So, I need to decide if there is a counteroffer that is more advantageous for me than 153/0.9 = 170.\n\nLet's look at the previous offers:\n\n* Round 1 offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n* Round 1 offer to me: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] gives me 2 * 73 = 146.\n* Round 1 Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\nLet's calculate the items remaining.\n* Item 1: 1\n* Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1\n* Item 3: 1\n* Item 4: 4 - 3 = 1\n* Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1\n\nI should give Player 1 as little as possible to make a deal. Player 1's initial offer to me was [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]. My initial offer was [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], which Player 1 rejected.\nMy current offer is [0, 1, 0, 3, 1], which gives me 138.\nIf I counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], that means I get [0, 2, 0, 4, 2]. My value = 2*50 + 4*5 + 2*73 = 100 + 20 + 146 = 266. 266 * 0.9 = 239.4 > 153. So it's good.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 some items while ensuring my discounted value is greater than my outside offer. My goal is to extract as much value as possible. Let's offer Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] to see if it helps me.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n",

My outside offer is 229.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(0 * 41) + (3 * 5) + (1 * 44) + (2 * 6) + (0 * 50) = 0 + 15 + 44 + 12 + 0 = 71\n\nSince 71 is much less than my outside offer of 229, accepting is not a good idea.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to decide what to offer Player 1.  My goal is to get an offer that is better than 229 (my outside offer). Since it's round 1, there are two more rounds to negotiate, so I don't necessarily need to get a deal *this* good immediately, but I should aim for something reasonable.\n\nLet's analyze the total amount of each item: 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\n\nTo make a reasonable counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might value. Without knowing their values, it's hard to make a perfectly optimal offer. However, I can try to offer them items I value less, and keep items I value more.\n\nI value item 2 and item 4 very low (5 and 6 respectively). I value item 1 and item 5 highly (41 and 50 respectively). I also value item 3 fairly high (44).\n\nI will offer Player 1 most of item 2 and item 4. Also, I will offer them some of item 3.

However, it's only round 1, and I have a discount factor of 0.9. This means I could potentially get a better deal if I counteroffer.\n\nLet's think about the maximum value I could possibly achieve. I have:\n- 9 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 6 units of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 8 units of item 5\n\nMy total value for all items is 1775.\n\nIf I accept now, I get 554. If I walk away, I get 325.\n\nIf I counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1's values might be. Since they are drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 101, it's difficult to predict their exact values. However, I can assume they want to maximize their own value.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, but still potentially acceptable to Player 1. I'll start by calculating the value Player 1 receives in the current offer. They receive:\n- 9 - 3 = 6 units of item 1\n- 3 - 0 = 3 units of item 2\n- 6 - 2 = 4 units of item 3\n- 5 - 3 = 2 units of item 4\n- 8 - 2 = 6 units of item 5\n\nSince I don't know their values, I'll aim for a slightly better offer for myself. I'll offer Player 1 slightly more of the items I value less, and less of the items I value more.\n\nLet's try offering them: [4, 1, 3, 4, 3]\nThis means I get:\n- 9 - 4 = 5 units of item 1\n- 3 - 1 = 2 units of item 2\n- 6 - 3 = 3 units of item 3\n- 5 - 4 = 1 unit of item 4\n- 8 - 3 = 5 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this counteroffer is:\n(5 * 85) + (2 * 65) + (3 * 89) + (1 * 29) + (5 * 17) = 425 + 130 + 267 + 29 + 85 = 936\n\nNow, this counteroffer is much better for me than the current offer. I need to think if it is reasonable enough for Player 1 to consider it.\n\nSince it is only round 1, I am going to try this more favorable counteroffer, hoping that Player 1 also wants to negotiate.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 3, 4, 3]}\n```",

Therefore, I aim to create an offer that gives me at least 176 in value because my outside offer provides this guaranteed valuation.\n\nTo create an initial offer, consider my private values for each item and how I might split items with Player 2:\n\n- Item 1 is of relatively low value to me. I could offer a majority of it.\n- Items based on priority are: Item 4 > Item 2 > Item 3 > Item 5 > Item 1.\n\nHere's a tentative distribution that maintains my desired target value:\n\n- Offer Player 2 a majority of the lower-value item 1 (5 out of 7).\n- Offer 1 unit of item 2 (a smaller share of a high-value item).\n- Offer item 3 entirely because of its singularity and less impact on total value.\n- Offer 3 units of item 4 (retaining higher value for me).\n- Offer 2 units of item 5 (less valuable, but equitably shared).\n\nNow, calculate my value from this offer:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 5 = 10\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 64 = 128\n- Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 40 = 0\n- Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 36 = 144\n- Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 10 = 30\n\nTotal value retained = 10 + 128 + 0 + 144 + 30 = 312\n\nThe retained value of 312 exceeds my outside offer value through round one without discount.

I need to decide whether to accept this offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me. My private values are 37, 9, 38, 24, and 64 for items 1 through 5. So, the value of the current offer is:\n\n(5 * 37) + (1 * 9) + (1 * 38) + (3 * 24) + (2 * 64) = 185 + 9 + 38 + 72 + 128 = 432\n\nSince it is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So, the present value of accepting the offer is 432.\n\nMy outside offer is 359. Therefore, accepting the offer is better than walking away right now. However, I need to consider if I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nTo determine a reasonable counteroffer, I need to know the total amount of each item available. These are 7, 3, 1, 7, 5 for items 1 through 5. If Player 1 offers me 5 of item 1, they get 7-5 = 2. If Player 1 offers me 1 of item 2, they get 3-1 = 2. If Player 1 offers me 1 of item 3, they get 1-1 = 0. If Player 1 offers me 3 of item 4, they get 7-3 = 4. If Player 1 offers me 2 of item 5, they get 5-2 = 3.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer where I give Player 1 a little more than what they originally have, but I also improve my position significantly. One approach is to aim for a more equal split where I get a lot of Item 5, and they get a lot of item 1.\nHow about I try to take 4 of item 5 and only offer the player 1, 1 of item 1 in return.\nMy offer : [1,0,0,0,4]. If I get my hands on those, I will get 6*37 + 3*9 + 0*38 + 7*24 + 1*64 = 222 + 27 + 0 + 168 + 64 = 481.\nSince my outside option is 359, I believe offering player 1 [1,0,0,0,4] can give me an even better result than to accept player 1's original offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 4]}\n",

In round 3, whatever offer Player 1 makes, it will lead to a WALK if I make a counteroffer. Therefore, let's consider what happens if I accept the offer that leads to indifference, and discount it one more round.\n\nLet the offer be x = [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]. Then, I will receive:\n(7-x1) units of item 1\n(3-x2) units of item 2\n(1-x3) units of item 3\n(7-x4) units of item 4\n(5-x5) units of item 5\n\nThe value to me is:\nV = (7-x1)*37 + (3-x2)*9 + (1-x3)*38 + (7-x4)*24 + (5-x5)*64\nV = 259 - 37*x1 + 27 - 9*x2 + 38 - 38*x3 + 168 - 24*x4 + 320 - 64*x5\nV = 812 - (37*x1 + 9*x2 + 38*x3 + 24*x4 + 64*x5)\n\nWe want V*0.9 >= 359. So V >= 359 / 0.9 = 398.89\nSo we want 812 - (37*x1 + 9*x2 + 38*x3 + 24*x4 + 64*x5) >= 398.89\nWhich means 37*x1 + 9*x2 + 38*x3 + 24*x4 + 64*x5 <= 812 - 398.89 = 413.11\n\nHowever, given this is round 2, the discount is 0.9. Walking away gives me 359. The current offer gives me 287*0.9 = 258.3.\nIn this case, it's better to walk away now and secure 359 rather than making any last-ditch counteroffers.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

My outside offer is 620.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 1's offer to me:\n(0 * 13) + (2 * 65) + (2 * 41) + (0 * 28) + (1 * 39) = 0 + 130 + 82 + 0 + 39 = 251\n\nNow, I need to compare this to my outside offer of 620.

The goal is to find a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept, which is better than my outside offer when discounted.\nI need to figure out how much Player 1 values each item.

My total value of all items is 1147.\n\nLet's think about what a reasonable counteroffer might look like. I have 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nLet's start by offering Player 1 a \"fair\" split, where I keep more of the valuable items. This will allow us to gauge where their values might lie, given their opening offer. I can adjust the counteroffer subsequently.\n\nLet's offer them half of everything. Since we can only deal in integers:\nItem 1: 0/2 = 0\nItem 2: 3/2 = 1\nItem 3: 4/2 = 2\nItem 4: 6/2 = 3\nItem 5: 1/2 = 0\nCounteroffer: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]\n\nNow I need to decide whether to offer this now or walk away.\nIf I walk away, I get 1145.\nIf I offer the counteroffer [0, 1, 2, 3, 0], here's what I would get:\nItem 1: 0 - 0 = 0\nItem 2: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 3: 4 - 2 = 2\nItem 4: 6 - 3 = 3\nItem 5: 1 - 0 = 1\nMy value: (0 * 80) + (2 * 76) + (2 * 99) + (3 * 75) + (1 * 73) = 0 + 152 + 198 + 225 + 73 = 648\n\nSince 648 is much less than 1145, it is better to walk away in the first round.\nHowever, I should account for the discount factor in the next round. In the next round, I get 0.9 * my offer value. \n\nI suspect that Player 1 will not accept the counteroffer, and I will walk away. But let's send a counteroffer now to see what happens.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]}\n",

Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\nI need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. If I make a counteroffer, it will be the last round.\n\nLet's consider the total number of items: 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n\nIn round 1, Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 0].

If I walk away, I get 478. If I make a counteroffer, the negotiation continues, and my potential payoff is discounted by 0.9 in the next round.\n\nTo decide on a counteroffer, I need to estimate what Player 1 might accept. I don't know Player 1's values, so I will try to create an offer that gives Player 1 just enough to be better than their unknown outside option while maximizing my own value.\n\nThe total amount of each item is: 1, 3, 7, 5, 3.\nI currently have: 1, 2, 4, 3, 1.\nI want to keep as much of item 2 as possible (value 99), then item 3 (value 39), then item 5 (value 30), then item 1 (value 28), then item 4 (value 23).\n\nLet's try to offer a counteroffer that is slightly better than my outside option if Player 1 keeps everything. \nI have 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\nMy total value is 1*28 + 3*99 + 7*39 + 5*23 + 3*30 = 28 + 297 + 273 + 115 + 90 = 803\nCurrent offer to me is [0, 1, 3, 2, 2].\nWhat I have is [1, 2, 4, 3, 1] which is worth 28 + 198 + 156 + 69 + 30 = 481.\nI will offer [1, 2, 4, 3, 1] to player 1. It leaves me with [0, 1, 3, 2, 2] which is only worth 322 to me, less than my outside option.\n\nLet's try and calculate a better offer. I need to get more value. I'll give them less. Let's offer [1, 1, 3, 2, 1].\nThis means I keep [0, 2, 4, 3, 2] which is worth 0 + 198 + 156 + 69 + 60 = 483.

One way to do this is to adjust the items I value lower than my outside offer and are more heavily skewed in current offers to Player 2:\n\n- Reduce what I concede in item types with lower value to me.\n- Structure a counteroffer that tries to balance the potential distribution, securing higher value items for myself.\n\n### My Counteroffer\nTo keep the negotiation going and increase my offer value:\n\n- Item 1: 0 (keep, highest value to me)\n- Item 2: 1 (concede one, high value to me)\n- Item 3: 2 (reduce my concession)\n- Item 4: 2 (concede evenly)\n- Item 5: 1 (concede low-value items)\n\nNew counteroffer: [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n\nThis should increase my own perceived value while maintaining a distribution that Player 2 might consider.

Since I want more of the items that have a higher value to me, I should strategize my initial offer carefully.\n\n**Strategy**:\n- I will keep the most valuable item to me, which is item 5. \n- I will give Player 2 the entire stock of item 2, which holds lesser value to me.\n- I'll distribute items 1, 3, and 4 between us but keep a fair share for myself, given the round 1 offer is generally used for anchoring.\n\nHere is a possible initial offer:\n\n- Offer Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n- Keep for myself: 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2 (since there's only 1 unit), 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n\nValue of kept items:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 30 = 60\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 25 = 75\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 42 = 42\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 * 61 = 244\n\nTotal value = 60 + 0 + 75 + 42 + 244 = 421\n\nThis offer ensures a higher value than the outside offer for me and leaves room for negotiation. Therefore, I will proceed with making this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 1, 3]}\n```",

Hence, further negotiating might risk player 2 walking, given this is round 2 and acceptance locks in higher than the outside offer.\n\n### Action\n- Given these calculations, the prudent decision is to accept the current offer as it gives satisfactory value compared to my outside offer and the risk of not reaching a better resolution in the last round. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Since it is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.0, so the present value is also 355.\nIf I walk away, my value is 1134.\n\nClearly, accepting the offer of 355 is worse than walking away with 1134. Therefore, I should either walk away or make a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider what a good counteroffer might look like. I want to maximize my value, so I want as much as possible of items 2 and 4, and as little as possible of item 5.\n\nSince the other player offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 3], they get:\n- Item 1: 4-1 = 3\n- Item 2: 5-1 = 4\n- Item 3: 5-2 = 3\n- Item 4: 6-2 = 4\n- Item 5: 4-3 = 1\n\nI need to offer a valid division of the items.

In round 2, the discount factor is 0.9. So, if I can get a deal worth more than 1134/0.9 = 1260, I should try for it.\n\nLet's start with an aggressive counteroffer. I offer them the bare minimum to make it still worth them to negotiate, instead of walking away. Given they initially offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 3], they must value that at less than their outside offer.\n\nBased on the earlier logic, I am choosing to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 3, 0, 1]}\n```",

This means they would get the remainder: [4-1, 5-1, 5-2, 6-2, 4-3] = [3, 4, 3, 4, 1].\n*   **My Values:** My values are 18, 74, 28, 90, and 9 for items 1 through 5.\n*   **My Outside Offer:** My outside offer is worth 1134.\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value, considering my outside offer.\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer**\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n\n*   (1 * 18) + (1 * 74) + (2 * 28) + (2 * 90) + (3 * 9) = 18 + 74 + 56 + 180 + 27 = 355\n\nNow, let's consider the discounted value of accepting the current offer in round 2:\n\n*   355 * 0.9 = 319.5\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 1134.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer**\n\nTo determine whether making a counteroffer is worthwhile, I need to estimate the maximum I could reasonably hope to get from Player 1 in the next round (round 3). Given their earlier offers, it seems like the player may not be rational. If I am to suggest a counteroffer, it needs to be better for me than my outside offer (1134 after discounting in the third round).\n\nWith a final discount of 0.9, I need 1134/0.9 = 1260 value to make a counter offer worthwhile. This would require almost all of the most valuable items, and it seems unlikely Player 1 would accept. Thus, a counteroffer would be unlikely to succeed and I am best walking.\n\n**Decision**\n\nSince the discounted value of accepting the current offer (319.5) is much lower than my outside offer (1134), and a better deal seems unlikely, the best course of action is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I need to estimate their possible valuations, which could range wildly due to randomness but assume they might be similar in scale, and then I make a reasonable initial allocation.\n\nA reasonable offer might give Player 2 fewer units of my higher value items (like items 1 and 2) and more of lower value items (like item 4):\n\nHere's one way I can divide the items hoping Player 2 finds it somewhat reasonable:\n\n- Offer Player 2: \n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 2 units\n  - Item 4: 1 unit\n  - Item 5: 2 unit\n\nThis offer leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 5 units \n- Item 2: 4 units\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nCalculating the expected value I retain:\n\n- My value of item 1: 5 units * 62 = 310\n- My value of item 2: 4 units * 49 = 196\n- My value of item 3: 2 units * 39 = 78\n- My value of item 4: 1 unit * 17 = 17\n- My value of item 5: 2 units * 34 = 68\n\nTotal retained value = 310 + 196 + 78 + 17 + 68 = 669\n\nThis value (669) is greater than my outside offer (524), so it's a viable starting point for negotiation.\n\nTherefore, I am making the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]}",

My private values are 24, 93, 50, 48, and 22 for items 1 through 5. My outside offer is 817. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(2 * 24) + (2 * 93) + (2 * 50) + (1 * 48) + (2 * 22) = 48 + 186 + 100 + 48 + 44 = 426\n\nSince it is round 1, if I accept, the value will be 426 * (0.9^(1-1)) = 426 * 1 = 426.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of walking away. If I walk away, I get my outside offer of 817.  Clearly, 817 is much better than 426.\n\nHowever, there's still a chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal in later rounds. To decide on a good counteroffer, I want to understand the maximum possible value I can obtain and how much I need to offer to Player 1 to make it acceptable for them. I also need to consider the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all the items for me:\n(7 * 24) + (6 * 93) + (4 * 50) + (2 * 48) + (4 * 22) = 168 + 558 + 200 + 96 + 88 = 1110\n\nGiven the large difference between the current offer (426) and my outside offer (817), and considering that I have all the leverage now, let me make a counteroffer that is barely acceptable to Player 1 to increase my possible benefit while considering the discount rate. Since I do not know Player 1's values, I will make an offer that gives them a moderate amount of each item.\n\nLet's consider offering [5, 4, 2, 1, 2] to Player 1. I'll keep the rest. This means I would get [2, 2, 2, 1, 2].\n\nMy value if this offer gets accepted: (2*24) + (2*93) + (2*50) + (1*48) + (2*22) = 48 + 186 + 100 + 48 + 44 = 426.\n\nSince 817 > 426, I will not accept.

My outside offer is 1563.\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So, the current value of the offer to me is simply 529.\n\nComparing the current offer (529) with my outside offer (1563), it's clear that the outside offer is much better. Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a bad choice.\n\nHowever, walking away immediately might not be optimal. I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer. My goal is to maximize my value, considering Player 1 will also want to maximize theirs.\n\nSince my outside offer is 1563, I need to ensure that any deal I make gives me at least 1563 * 0.9 = 1406.7 in round 2.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer. I need to estimate what Player 1's values might be. Since they are uniformly drawn from 1 to 101, let's assume their average values are around 51.\n\nThe total available items are: 7 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\nIf I give everything to Player 1: Player 1 receives [7, 2, 5, 3, 6]\n\nI need to find an allocation where I get a value significantly greater than 529 * 0.9 and player 1 gets a value greater than their outside option.\n\nThe total value of the items for me is: (7 * 96) + (2 * 27) + (5 * 31) + (3 * 89) + (6 * 88) = 672 + 54 + 155 + 267 + 528 = 1676.\n\nI will make an offer where I keep most of item 1, 4, 5, while giving away most of item 2 and 3.\n\nLet's offer Player 1: [1, 1, 3, 1, 1].

This means I get:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nThe value of this offer to me is:\n(2 * 96) + (0 * 27) + (2 * 31) + (0 * 89) + (4 * 88) = 192 + 0 + 62 + 0 + 352 = 606\n\nSince it is round 2, this value needs to be discounted by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9. So, the present value of the offer is:\n606 * 0.9 = 545.4\n\nMy outside offer is worth 1563.  Since 545.4 < 1563, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. If I walk away, I get 1563. If I make a counteroffer, it will be the last round, and Player 1 can either accept it or walk away. I need to make an offer that Player 1 is likely to accept, while still giving me a higher value than my outside offer after discounting it by gamma.\n\nLet's try to estimate Player 1's values. We know the total amounts of each item: 7, 2, 5, 3, 6.\nIn Round 1, Player 1 offered me [0, 1, 2, 0, 5]. This suggests that Player 1 might value items 2 and 5 relatively highly.\nIn Round 2, Player 1 offered me [2, 0, 2, 0, 4]. This suggests they reduced their offer on items 2 and 5.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 an offer that gives me just a little above my outside offer. That means I want to get a value of 1563/0.9 = 1736.67.\nThe total value of all items is:\n(7 * 96) + (2 * 27) + (5 * 31) + (3 * 89) + (6 * 88) = 672 + 54 + 155 + 267 + 528 = 1676\n\nTo get 1737, I'll consider the total value slightly above 1676 (that is, consider I'm taking slightly more than what's available, by slightly reducing what I offer to Player 1 to increase my value.)\nTotal Value = 1676\nI want my final value to be > 1563 / .9 = 1736.67\nValue I get from offer + Value I give to player one needs to be less than total value times 0.9.\nSo if I make a counteroffer, it would be as follows: offer is 1737. Let x be the offer to player 1. So player 1 value would be 1676 - 1737 = -61?\nTherefore I cannot ask for slightly above my discounted offer without offering negative value to the player. I will just offer my discounted outside offer, so I have 1563 after discounting.\nMy value must be > 1563/0.9 = 1736.67.  Total available is 1676.\nSo I should just WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since the current offer's value (331) is significantly lower than my outside offer (811), it would be beneficial to walk away if this were the last round. However, this is round 1, so there are two more rounds to negotiate. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\n**Counteroffer Strategy:**\n\nTo decide on a counteroffer, I want to propose a split that's better than my outside option in present value terms, but still attractive to player 1, or at least not obviously worse than walking away themselves, or they will just walk away. I need to consider what a good offer *might* be to player 1, but since I don't have their values, this is harder to estimate.\n\nHere's my reasoning for how to craft a counteroffer:\n\n1.  **Target Value:** I want to achieve a value greater than my outside offer of 811. If I receive value 'x' this round, then adjusted by the discount factor, I want x >= 811, if we walked away after this round, or x*0.9 >= 811 if we walked away after round 2, or x*0.9*0.9 >= 811 if we walked away after round 3.\n\n2.  **Total Item Values:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units * 23 = 69\n    *   Item 2: 4 units * 30 = 120\n    *   Item 3: 8 units * 66 = 528\n    *   Item 4: 1 units * 46 = 46\n    *   Item 5: 5 units * 73 = 365\n    *   Total value: 69 + 120 + 528 + 46 + 365 = 1128\n\n3.  **Initial Counteroffer:** I will start with a counteroffer that gives me significantly more value than the current offer, hoping Player 1 will accept. Let's say I want to aim for a value around 900 initially, to have some room to negotiate. So, I offer player 1 whatever is left over when I take what would give me value of 900.\n\n4.  **Counteroffer Composition:** Since I value Item 5 and Item 3 the most, I want as much of them as possible. Item 1, Item 2, Item 4 are relatively less important.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Counteroffer (what I offer to Player 1):**\n\n    *   I keep 3 units of Item 1: 3 * 23 = 69\n    *   I keep 4 units of Item 2: 4 * 30 = 120\n    *   I keep 5 units of Item 3: 5 * 66 = 330\n    *   I keep 1 units of Item 4: 1 * 46 = 46\n    *   I keep 5 units of Item 5: 5 * 73 = 365\n    *   Total value I keep: 69 + 120 + 330 + 46 + 365 = 930\n\nThis would mean giving Player 1 the following: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nThis seems to be the right ballpark. I should offer player 1 3 units of item 3.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

Accepting this offer is not beneficial as its value pales in comparison to the guaranteed outside offer.\n\nGiven the large difference between the adjusted value of the current offer and my outside offer, accepting the current offer is not favorable.

Since this is the first round, there currently is no offer on the table from Player 2, so I need to make an initial offer.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the values of the items for me:\n\n- Item 1: 96 per unit\n- Item 2: 94 per unit\n- Item 3: 95 per unit\n- Item 4: 98 per unit (0 available)\n- Item 5: 34 per unit\n\nTotal items available:\n\n- Item 1: 4 units\n- Item 2: 4 units\n- Item 3: 4 units\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 5 units\n\nMy total value for all items is calculated as:\n\n- Value of Item 1 = 4 units * 96 = 384\n- Value of Item 2 = 4 units * 94 = 376\n- Value of Item 3 = 4 units * 95 = 380\n- Value of Item 5 = 5 units * 34 = 170\n\nTotal value = 384 + 376 + 380 + 170 = 1310\n\nMy outside offer is 860. Thus, I should aim for an in-negotiation value greater than 860 discounted by any delay.\n\nTo maximize my outcome, I want to retain the items that offer the highest unit value to me, primarily items 1, 2, and 3. Item 5 is of lesser personal value, thus can be used as leverage in negotiations.\n\n**Initial Offer Strategy:**\n\nTo secure a deal that exceeds my outside offer, I'll propose giving up items that are less valuable to me but might hold value to Player 2. Since I know nothing about Player 2\u2019s valuation, I'll start with a smaller offer that maintains a high return for myself while leaving room for negotiation:\n\n- Offer Player 2: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\nThis would leave me with the more valuable items and most of item 5. \n\nHere's the calculation if Player 2 accepts:\n\n- My retained items: \n  - Retain all units of item 1: 4 * 96 = 384\n  - Retain all units of item 2: 4 * 94 = 376\n  - Retain all units of item 3: 4 * 95 = 380\n  - Retain 3 units of item 5: 3 * 34 = 102\n- Total retained value = 384 + 376 + 380 + 102 = 1242\n\nA round one acceptance would not be discounted, making a value of 1242 better than my outside offer of 860.\n\nLet's proceed with this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]}",

I need to give Player 1 something that they value more than I do.\n\nIf I give everything to player 1, my value is 0. This is obviously not the strategy.\n\nI want to improve over 554.

My values for these items are 74, 41, 61, 26, and 15. My outside offer is 113. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 74) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 61) + (1 * 26) + (0 * 15) = 74 + 82 + 183 + 26 + 0 = 365\n\nSince 365 > 113, accepting the offer is better than walking away right now. However, we're in round 1, so there's a chance to get a better deal. Let's consider making a counteroffer.\n\nI want to maximize my value, which means minimizing the value I give to Player 1. Player 1's offer implies they want at least:\nItem 1: 6 - 1 = 5\nItem 2: 3 - 2 = 1\nItem 3: 4 - 3 = 1\nItem 4: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n\nLet's consider the opposite extreme. A counteroffer of [5, 1, 1, 2, 1] means that I get the rest:\nItem 1: 6 - 5 = 1\nItem 2: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 3: 4 - 1 = 3\nItem 4: 3 - 2 = 1\nItem 5: 1 - 1 = 0\nValue to me: (1 * 74) + (2 * 41) + (3 * 61) + (1 * 26) + (0 * 15) = 74 + 82 + 183 + 26 = 365\n\nSo that gives me the same. How about a bit more greedy.\n\nMy strategy is to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer and see how Player 1 responds. Since I only have 3 rounds, I don't want to be *too* aggressive and risk a walk away. Let's try to get just a bit more from Item 3, as that is the one that Player 1 doesn't care much about, giving them 1 of it. \n\nCounteroffer: [5, 1, 0, 2, 1].\nThis means I get:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 0\nValue to me: 74 + 82 + 244 + 26 = 426\n\n426 * 0.9 = 383.4 which still beats the initial offer and outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 1, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and Player 1 has offered me [1, 0, 7, 0, 3], meaning they want me to have 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 43\n- Item 2: 17\n- Item 3: 66\n- Item 4: 93\n- Item 5: 79\nMy outside offer is 782.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 43) + (0 * 17) + (7 * 66) + (0 * 93) + (3 * 79) = 43 + 0 + 462 + 0 + 237 = 742\n\nSince my outside offer is 782, and the current offer is worth 742, I should not accept the current offer. I need to decide between walking away or making a counteroffer.\n\nIf I walk away, I get 782. If I make a counteroffer, and it is accepted in round 2, the value is discounted by 0.9. If it is accepted in round 3, the value is discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\nLet's consider what a good counteroffer would be. I want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 enough to make them accept. Player 1 currently gets:\n- Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Item 2: 0 - 0 = 0\n- Item 3: 7 - 7 = 0\n- Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n- Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2\n\nI don't know Player 1's values, so it's difficult to predict what they would accept. However, I can try to offer them something that is relatively low value to me, but potentially high value to them. Item 2 has the lowest value to me, and I have zero.  Item 1 has the next lowest value to me, and there are 3 available.  I will aim for a counteroffer where I receive at least 782/0.9 = 868.89.\n\nSince I don't have information about player 1's preferences, I will attempt to get as much of items 4 and 5 as possible and see if it gets accepted next round. I will offer player 1 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nMy value is then (1 * 43) + (0 * 17) + (0 * 66) + (2 * 93) + (3 * 79) = 43 + 0 + 0 + 186 + 237 = 466.\nThis is lower than my outside option, so this strategy is not very good. I should instead offer to give away all of the items except items 4 and 5. I offer 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value is (0 * 43) + (0 * 17) + (0 * 66) + (2 * 93) + (0 * 79) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 186 + 0 = 186. This is not good.\n\nI will make an offer where I get almost all the items, and Player 1 just gets items 1 and 3. I will offer 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5. My value is (2 * 43) + (0 * 17) + (0 * 66) + (2 * 93) + (5 * 79) = 86 + 0 + 0 + 186 + 395 = 667. This is still not higher than my walkaway amount.\n\nSince I can only counteroffer or walk, and accepting gives me a lower value than walking, I will walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 6 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThe value of this offer to me is (0 * 40) + (0 * 89) + (6 * 71) + (0 * 24) + (1 * 28) = 0 + 0 + 426 + 0 + 28 = 454.\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. Thus, the present value of this offer is 454.\n\nMy outside offer is worth 1301.  Clearly, 454 is much less than 1301. So, accepting this offer is a bad idea.\n\nI need to decide between walking away and making a counteroffer. If I walk away, I get 1301. If I make a counteroffer, I have to consider what Player 1 might accept.\n\nLet's consider what my ideal scenario would be, and then work backwards to create a more realistic counteroffer. Ideally, I want to keep the items I value the most. Item 2 is my highest value item (89/unit), so I should aim to keep most or all of those. Item 3 is second highest (71/unit). The maximum I can get is 4*40+7*89+6*71+4*24+1*28=1333\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer that gives Player 1 enough value for them to accept, while also giving me more than my outside offer. I'll aim for a split that gives me around 1301 in value.\n\nA reasonable counteroffer strategy would be to offer player 1 some of Item 1 and some of Item 4, as those have the lowest values for me. Let's construct an offer where I keep all item 2, keep half of item 3, and take some or all of items 1, 4 and 5.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [4, 0, 3, 4, 0]\nThis leaves me with [0, 7, 3, 0, 1]\nMy value would be 0*40 + 7*89 + 3*71 + 0*24 + 1*28 = 0 + 623 + 213 + 0 + 28 = 864. This is too low.\nLet's try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis leaves me with [4, 7, 6, 4, 1]\nMy value is 4*40 + 7*89 + 6*71 + 4*24 + 1*28 = 160 + 623 + 426 + 96 + 28 = 1333.\nPlayer 1 gets [0,0,0,0,0]. This is not reasonable for player 1.\n\nLet's aim for a more realistic value. In round 1, giving away a little more might encourage a deal. Given the fact that I have 1301 as my outside option, my initial offer should ideally give me something slightly better than that in terms of expected value. This would mean aiming for roughly 1301/0.9 = 1445 value in the final outcome. A reasonable approach would be to ask for a bit more in initial offers since this is round 1.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the offer from Player 1. The value of the offer to me is 454, and to Player 1 is 6*X3 + 1*X5, where X3 and X5 are Player 1's values for items 3 and 5.\n\nI'll try a counteroffer where I get to keep all of item 2, most of item 3 and all of item 5. To do this, I would offer Player 1 all of item 1, all of item 4, and some of item 3. Let's say I offer Player 1 [4, 0, 3, 4, 0]. This would leave me with [0, 7, 3, 0, 1]. This has a value of 864 for me as calculated before. In this scenario, Player 1 would receive 4*X1 + 3*X3 + 4*X4.\n\nTo make this worthwhile I need a better offer. If I offer [2,0,4,2,0], then I have [2,7,2,2,1], this would equal 2*40+7*89+2*71+2*24+1*28 = 80+623+142+48+28 = 921.\n\nAnother approach would be to offer player 1 more of Item 3. Try [0,0,5,0,0]. That would leave me with [4,7,1,4,1] for a value of 4*40+7*89+1*71+4*24+1*28 = 160+623+71+96+28 = 978.\n\nLet's try something that is a bit more even and valuable for me:\n\nCounteroffer [1, 0, 3, 1, 0]\nThis leaves me with [3, 7, 3, 3, 1]\nMy value is 3*40 + 7*89 + 3*71 + 3*24 + 1*28 = 120 + 623 + 213 + 72 + 28 = 1056\n\nIt's still less than my outside option. This means, the most optimal action given my current state is to make a counter offer to start the negotiation process. Given the nature of round 1, offering a more favorable offer to Player 1 to entice a deal in later rounds is logical.\nGiven this information, I'm still going to walk away if I need to.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

So, the present value of the current offer is 828 * 0.9 = 745.2.\n\n**Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n\nPlayer 2's outside offer is 1301.  The discounted value of accepting the current offer (745.2) is significantly lower than the outside offer.\n\n**Possible Actions & Reasoning:**\n\n*   **ACCEPT:** This would give a discounted value of 745.2, which is worse than walking away.\n*   **WALK:** This guarantees a value of 1301.\n*   **COUNTEROFFER:** A counteroffer in round 2 might lead to a better outcome in round 3 if Player 1 accepts, but we need to consider the risk of Player 1 walking away or making an unacceptable offer. Given the large difference between the current offer and the outside option, it would be hard to generate a mutually acceptable offer in round 3. Also, this is the last opportunity to make a counteroffer.\n\nSince the outside option significantly exceeds the current offer's discounted value, and making a deal better than 1301 seems difficult, the optimal strategy is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Thus, accepting the offer makes no sense for me.\n\n5. **Potential Counteroffer Strategy**:\n   - I will create a counteroffer aiming to maximize my gain while being fair enough to avoid being rejected by the other player. \n\n6. **Counteroffer Calculation**: \n   - I will offer fewer high-value items to Player 2 and focus on keeping more of the items that are valuable to me.\n   - Allocating more of item 2 and item 5 to myself makes sense because they bring the most value to me.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that could balance these needs:\n\n- Counteroffer to Player 2: [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]\n  - This means I'm allocating to myself: \n    - 1 unit of item 1 (Value = 1 * 41 = 41)\n    - 3 units of item 2 (Value = 3 * 93 = 279)\n    - 4 units of item 3 (Value = 4 * 35 = 140)\n    - 5 units of item 4 (Value = 5 * 23 = 115)\n    - 4 units of item 5 (Value = 4 * 66 = 264)\n  - Total value for me = 41 + 279 + 140 + 115 + 264 = 839\n  - Discounted total value for me = 839 * 0.9 = 755.1. \n\nThis is still less than my outside offer's discounted value, but it's strategic for negotiation. If this does not get Player 2's interest, I need to be prepared to WALK.\n\nGiven these calculations, my move is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and the current offer on the table is [0, 0, 1, 3, 0], meaning I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My private values are 61, 69, 33, 10, 81. My outside offer is 488. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(0 * 61) + (0 * 69) + (1 * 33) + (3 * 10) + (0 * 81) = 0 + 0 + 33 + 30 + 0 = 63\n\nSince it's round 2, the discounted value of the current offer is 63 * 0.9^(2-1) = 63 * 0.9 = 56.7.\n\nMy outside offer is 488.  Therefore, if I walk away, I get 488.  Since 56.7 < 488, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow let's consider a counteroffer. My goal is to find an offer that Player 1 might accept but is better for me than my outside offer (when discounted). To make a reasonable counteroffer, I need to understand what Player 1's approximate value is.  The history shows Player 1 offered me [0, 1, 1, 4, 2] then [0, 0, 1, 3, 0].  This suggests they value items 2, 4, and 5 more highly than items 1 and 3. Let's try to offer them slightly less of what they seemed to want, but much less than my value.\n\nI have 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\nA counteroffer of [0, 1, 2, 5, 3] would give me:\nItem 1: 1 - 0 = 1\nItem 2: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 3: 5 - 2 = 3\nItem 4: 8 - 5 = 3\nItem 5: 4 - 3 = 1\n\nMy value for this counteroffer is:\n(1 * 61) + (2 * 69) + (3 * 33) + (3 * 10) + (1 * 81) = 61 + 138 + 99 + 30 + 81 = 409\n\nDiscounted value in round 2: 409 * 0.9 = 368.1. Still less than 488.\n\nA counteroffer of [0, 0, 3, 6, 2] would give me:\nItem 1: 1 - 0 = 1\nItem 2: 3 - 0 = 3\nItem 3: 5 - 3 = 2\nItem 4: 8 - 6 = 2\nItem 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nMy value for this counteroffer is:\n(1 * 61) + (3 * 69) + (2 * 33) + (2 * 10) + (2 * 81) = 61 + 207 + 66 + 20 + 162 = 516\n\nDiscounted value in round 2: 516 * 0.9 = 464.4. Still less than 488.\n\nI need to get above 488/0.9 = 542.22 to be better than the outside offer.\n\nLet me be selfish and offer more to Player 1. Consider offering: [1, 3, 5, 8, 4]. This leaves me with zero. This will not exceed my outside offer value.\n\nIt seems unlikely I can get a good deal here. The best option is to walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that any negotiated value below this is less beneficial to me than accepting my outside offer. Thus, I need to secure an offer that gives me a value greater than 777 to be better off.\n\nLet's suppose I want to make an initial offer where I keep more of the higher-valued items (item 3 and item 4), and offer Player 2 less of these items. I need to propose a division that gives me the maximum value while still incentivizing Player 2 to potentially counteroffer beneficially.\n\nLet\u2019s construct an initial offer:\n\n- I will keep all of item 3 (5 units worth 465) and item 4 (2 units worth 140), since they are most valuable to me.\n- I will give a lighter portion of item 2, say 3 units, which gives me still significant gain (3 units reserved for me worth 126).\n- I will offer the entirety of item 1 and item 5 (since they are least beneficial in comparison) to Player 2.\n  \nOffer to Player 2:\n\n- Item 1: 4 (all units)\n- Item 2: 3 (half the units)\n- Item 3: 0 (none of it)\n- Item 4: 0 (none of it)\n- Item 5: 4 (all units)\n\nRemaining for me:\n\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 5\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 0\n\nCalculate my value:\n\n- Value = (0 * 7) + (3 * 42) + (5 * 93) + (2 * 70) + (0 * 12)\n- Value = 0 + 126 + 465 + 140 + 0\n- Value = 731\n\nEven though 731 is below 777, this is a first-round offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and Player 1 has offered me [3, 2, 2, 1, 2] of items 1 through 5, respectively. My private values are [15, 56, 2, 95, 19] for items 1 through 5, and my outside offer is 591. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(3 * 15) + (2 * 56) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 95) + (2 * 19) = 45 + 112 + 4 + 95 + 38 = 294\n\nSince 294 is less than my outside offer of 591, accepting this offer would be a bad idea.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To determine a good counteroffer, I need to estimate Player 1's values. Since I don't know their values, I will aim for a split that gives me slightly more than my outside option while leaving player 1 with a bit more than what I am getting now.\n\nHere's my reasoning for a counteroffer: I need to secure at least 591 / 0.9 = 656.67 worth of items in the final deal to make a counteroffer worthwhile (given the discount factor). I need to give the other player some incentive to accept.\n\nLet's aim for a deal where I get around 4 units of item 4 because it has the highest per unit value to me. In that case, the amount I give them is [7,4,5,0,4] - [0,0,0,4,0]=[7,4,5,0,4].\nNow let's calculate the value of my offer to them:\n(7 * v1) + (4 * v2) + (5 * v3) + (0 * v4) + (4 * v5)\nwhere v1, v2, v3, v4, and v5 are Player 1's private values for items 1 through 5.\nI will try to make a counteroffer which is better than the current offer for player 1 and also better than my outside option.\n\nLet me try a counteroffer where I give Player 1 slightly more than they initially offered to me. I'll offer them [4, 3, 3, 1, 3]. This means I would receive [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]. The value to me would be:\n(3 * 15) + (1 * 56) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 95) + (1 * 19) = 45 + 56 + 4 + 95 + 19 = 219. The discounted value would be 219 * 0.9^0 = 219 which is much smaller than 591. It is a very bad deal for me.\n\nNow, I think I will make an extreme offer where I keep almost all the items and hope that Player 1's outside option isn't too good and he accepts. I will offer player 1 [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means I get [6, 3, 4, 2, 3]\nMy payoff would be: 6*15 + 3*56 + 4*2 + 2*95 + 3*19 = 90 + 168 + 8 + 190 + 57 = 513\nThis is still worse than my outside offer of 591. I might have to walk in this first round itself.\n\nGiven all of this, the best option is to make a counteroffer that gets me close to my outside option.\nLet's try to secure item 4 because of its high value. Offer them [7, 4, 5, 0, 4]. So I get [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nThe value to me is 2 * 95 = 190 which is very low!\nI should probably walk away! But since I want to explore a bit, I will offer them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would mean I get [7, 4, 5, 2, 4]\n7 * 15 + 4 * 56 + 5 * 2 + 2 * 95 + 4 * 19 = 105 + 224 + 10 + 190 + 76 = 605\nThis is slightly better than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Let's analyze the situation:\n\n*   I have 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n*   Player 1 offered me: 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\n*   This means Player 1 currently has: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n\nSince 433 is already quite good, I don't need to be too greedy. A small adjustment might be sufficient to get an even better deal, while also being attractive to Player 1. I will attempt to trade item 2, of which they have 4, for item 5, of which they have 0.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 the following: 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 0 of item 5\nIf this offer is accepted, I will receive 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 6 of item 5\nMy value is now: (0 \\* 71) + (3 \\* 33) + (1 \\* 67) + (0 \\* 58) + (6 \\* 50) = 0 + 99 + 67 + 0 + 300 = 466\n\nThis is greater than the original 433.

So, 582 * 0.9 = 523.8. This is significantly higher than my outside offer of 312.\n\n*   **WALK:** My value would be my outside offer of 312.\n\n*   **COUNTEROFFER:** This is risky because if Player 1 rejects, I'll have to WALK in round 3.

This is a guaranteed value that I can fall back on if the negotiation does not give me a higher value.\n\n3. **Discounting**: Since this is round 1, a potential agreement would not be discounted (gamma^0 = 1). Therefore, the value of an agreed deal remains the same as its nominal value in this round.\n\n4. **Negotiating Strategy**:\n   - My goal is to achieve a deal that surpasses the value of my outside offer (260) at the current gamma rate.\n   - I should try to propose a division of items where my total valuation is significantly higher than the 260 threshold, given the uncertainty of Player 2's private values and outside offer.\n\n5. **Propose a Counteroffer**:\n   - I should offer a division of items that keeps high-value items in my possession while starting the negotiation on a more favorable term.\n   - I'll aim to retain more of item 1 and item 4, which have high individual values for me.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that ensures my value exceeds my outside option while leaving room for potential counter-negotiations:\n\n- I will offer Player 2:\n  - 2 units of item 1 (2*53 = 106 value for me)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (1*33 = 33 value for me)\n  - 3 units of item 3 (3*31 = 93 value for me)\n  - 3 units of item 4 (3*39 = 117 value for me)\n  - 0 units of item 5 (0*5 = 0 value for me)\n\nThus my counteroffer will be: [2, 1, 3, 3, 0]\n\nThis means I am keeping:\n- 4 units of item 1 (4*53 = 212)\n- 2 units of item 2 (2*33 = 66)\n- 3 units of item 3 (3*31 = 93)\n- 6 units of item 4 (6*39 = 234)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (1*5 = 5)\n\nMy total value from this offer would then be: 212 + 66 + 93 + 234 + 5 = 610, which is significantly greater than my outside value of 260, thus worth negotiating over. \n\nSo, the action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 3, 0]}\n```",

This means Player 1 is offering me 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 42\n- Item 2: 63\n- Item 3: 26\n- Item 4: 64\n- Item 5: 23\n\nMy outside offer is 367.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(2 * 42) + (1 * 63) + (3 * 26) + (3 * 64) + (0 * 23) = 84 + 63 + 78 + 192 + 0 = 417\n\nSince 417 > 367 (my outside offer), accepting the current offer is better than walking away immediately. However, this is only round 1, so there's a discount factor to consider in future rounds (gamma = 0.9).\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. To figure out a good counteroffer, I want to figure out how much Player 1 values the items. I have no insight into this. As such, I will proceed by trying to make a minimal improvement to the counter offer, hoping to keep the negotiation going, but improving my standing.\n\nMy total value is 1196. Given the current offer, I'm receiving:\nItem 1: 2, leaving 6 - 2 = 4 for Player 1\nItem 2: 1, leaving 3 - 1 = 2 for Player 1\nItem 3: 3, leaving 6 - 3 = 3 for Player 1\nItem 4: 3, leaving 9 - 3 = 6 for Player 1\nItem 5: 0, leaving 1 - 0 = 1 for Player 1\n\nI will try to get one more unit of item 4.\nNew offer to Player 1: [2, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\nThis would mean I receive:\nItem 1: 6 - 2 = 4\nItem 2: 3 - 2 = 1\nItem 3: 6 - 3 = 3\nItem 4: 9 - 2 = 7\nItem 5: 1 - 1 = 0\n\nMy value would be:\n(4 * 42) + (1 * 63) + (3 * 26) + (7 * 64) + (0 * 23) = 168 + 63 + 78 + 448 + 0 = 757\n\nSince 757 > 417, it is an improvement.

If we go into the next round (\\(r=3\\)), my potential value would be multiplied by \\(\\gamma^1 = 0.9\\). My present value in that scenario would be:\n\n\\[611 \\times 0.9 = 549.9\\]\n\nThis value (549.9) is also still greater than my outside offer (260), indicating I should continue negotiating if I believe I can maintain or improve upon that outcome.\n\n### Evaluate Next Steps\nGiven the current offer and potential values, I could propose a counteroffer that pushes for a little more in my favor, while still being reasonable to attempt acceptance by Player 2. Let's consider aiming to increase what I receive in the higher-value items without risking a negative response:\n\n- Slightly alter the counteroffer while acknowledging Player 2's potential willingness to accept changes close to their previous offers.\n\n**Counteroffer Consideration:**\n\n- Reduce my offered units in high-value items like 1 and 4 slightly.\n  \nProposed Counteroffer to Player 2:\n\n- Item 1: Offer 3 (I aim to receive 3)\n- Item 2: Offer 2 (Receive 1, as it's already favorable)\n- Item 3: Offer 3 (Receive 3)\n- Item 4: Offer 3 (Still get 6, positively adjusted)\n- Item 5: Offer 1 (Receive 0 as they're not valuable to me)\n\nThis is effectively suggesting: [3, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n\n### Conclusion\nWith these calculations and strategic thoughts, it is advantageous to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 3, 3, 1]}\n```",

A reasonable strategy is to aim for a portion that gives me a value well above 528, allowing for negotiation flexibility.\n\nI will take the following initial distribution values and offer the remainder to Player 2:\n\n1.

Therefore, the value of the current offer is simply 512.\n\nSince 512 > 410, accepting the offer is better than walking away right now. However, I should consider whether I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nI have the following units of each item:\n- Item 1: 6\n- Item 2: 5\n- Item 3: 6\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 1\n\nIf I accept the current offer, I get 512. If I walk away, I get 410.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value. Player 1 offered [2, 2, 3, 1, 0], meaning they would receive [4, 3, 3, 1, 1].\nMy total value for all the items is 1275.\nMy goal is to get as close to this total value as possible after accounting for the discount factor in later rounds.\nI need to give them just enough to accept.\n\nI will make a counteroffer. I will try to take a bigger chunk of the higher-value items, since I value those more.\nLet's try offering Player 1: [4, 3, 3, 1, 1]. This would give me: [2, 2, 3, 1, 0], which is the original offer, and I already valued that at 512.\nSo instead let's try giving them a little bit more of the lower value items so that I can keep more of the high-value items.

Since 523.8 > 410, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\nHowever, it is also important to look at if I should counter offer again. The last round is where I would be forced to WALK if I counter offered, meaning it is critical to maximize my value here. If I make a counter offer this round, I will have to divide the items such that the values are such that I will gain more than 410 * 0.9 = 369.\n\nIf I try to go lower, then I have the outside offer to protect myself, so it would be safe to try to maximize.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 a bit more than they're currently asking for. For example, giving Player 1 [3, 3, 3, 1, 1]. This would leave me with:\n[3, 2, 3, 1, 0]\nMy value would be: (3*92) + (2*8) + (3*89) + (1*45) + (0*59) = 276 + 16 + 267 + 45 + 0 = 604.\nThis multiplied by 0.9 gives me 543.6 which is still better than my outside option!\n\nLet's try an even more greedy counter offer: giving Player 1 [4, 4, 3, 1, 1].\nThis leaves me with:\n[2, 1, 3, 1, 0]\nMy value would be: (2*92) + (1*8) + (3*89) + (1*45) + (0*59) = 184 + 8 + 267 + 45 + 0 = 504.\nThis multiplied by 0.9 gives me 453.6 which is still better than my outside option!\n\nLet's try giving Player 1 [4, 4, 4, 1, 1].\nThis leaves me with:\n[2, 1, 2, 1, 0]\nMy value would be: (2*92) + (1*8) + (2*89) + (1*45) + (0*59) = 184 + 8 + 178 + 45 + 0 = 415.\nThis multiplied by 0.9 gives me 373.5 which is still better than my outside option!\n\nLet's push one last time, giving Player 1 [4, 4, 4, 2, 1].\nThis leaves me with:\n[2, 1, 2, 0, 0]\nMy value would be: (2*92) + (1*8) + (2*89) + (0*45) + (0*59) = 184 + 8 + 178 + 0 + 0 = 370.\nThis multiplied by 0.9 gives me 333, which is worse than my outside option of 369.\n\nThe best counter offer will thus be giving Player 1 [4, 4, 4, 1, 1], which leaves me with 453.6 after discounting.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 4, 4, 1, 1]}\n```",

The current offer on the table is [2, 3, 0, 0, 3], meaning I would receive 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. My private values are 93, 83, 49, 60, and 9 for items 1 through 5, respectively. My outside offer is 259. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer:\n(2 * 93) + (3 * 83) + (0 * 49) + (0 * 60) + (3 * 9) = 186 + 249 + 0 + 0 + 27 = 462.\n\nSince 462 is greater than my outside offer of 259, accepting this offer is better than walking away *right now*. However, it's round 1, and there are two more rounds to potentially improve the offer. If I reject the offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance Player 1 will accept it, or make a better offer in round 2. The value of the offer in round 2 will be discounted by 0.9. The value of the offer in round 3 will be discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\nThe total number of items are 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5. I need to propose a counteroffer that gives Player 1 \"enough\" to keep them in the negotiation but still maximizes my own value.\n\nLet's consider the extreme case where I give Player 1 nothing. This corresponds to offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and keeping all items. This would give me a value of:\n(7 * 93) + (5 * 83) + (2 * 49) + (1 * 60) + (6 * 9) = 651 + 415 + 98 + 60 + 54 = 1278.\nHowever, Player 1 will certainly reject this.\n\nNow, I must try to predict what Player 1's valuation is. Since I don't know their valuation, it's difficult to know what offer they would deem acceptable. However, since they have made an initial offer already, I can assume that they value items 1, 2 and 5 at least somewhat.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that is slightly worse than the initial offer but still provides me with a good amount of items. I will offer Player 1 [2, 2, 0, 0, 2].\nThis means I would receive: [5, 3, 2, 1, 4]\nMy valuation would then be: (5 * 93) + (3 * 83) + (2 * 49) + (1 * 60) + (4 * 9) = 465 + 249 + 98 + 60 + 36 = 908\nThis is greater than 462, which I would receive if I accepted, and much larger than the outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 0, 2]}\n",

So the present value of accepting this offer is 202 * 0.9 = 181.8.\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 259, so accepting the offer is worse than walking away *at face value*. However, walking away means the game ends. I have one more chance to make a counteroffer that could give me a better outcome. I need to consider if a counteroffer is beneficial.\n\nTo make a profitable counteroffer, I need to offer Player 1 something they value highly while retaining items that I value highly. I also need to consider what their possible values are for each item.\n\nGiven that their offer in round 1 was [2, 3, 0, 0, 3] and then [0, 2, 0, 0, 4] in round 2 (offer *to me*), they might value items 1 and 2 less than I do, and may be trying to get more of item 5, relatively speaking. It's hard to know for sure without knowing their values.\n\nLet's think about a counteroffer. I need to offer them something valuable enough that they'll accept it. Let's assume they value item 1 somewhat, and maybe item 5 somewhat.\n\nMy goal is to get more of item 1 and item 2. Let's try a counteroffer where I offer them more item 5 and some item 1.\n\nI have 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that gives them 4 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 5 of item 5. This means I would get: 3 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\nMy value for this is: (3 * 93) + (5 * 83) + (2 * 49) + (1 * 60) + (1 * 9) = 279 + 415 + 98 + 60 + 9 = 861\n\nDiscounted, this is 861 * 0.9 = 774.9. This is way better than walking away. But is it likely Player 1 will accept this?\n\nLet's try a less aggressive counteroffer: I offer them 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. This means I would get: 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\nMy value for this is: (4 * 93) + (4 * 83) + (2 * 49) + (1 * 60) + (2 * 9) = 372 + 332 + 98 + 60 + 18 = 880\n\nDiscounted, this is 880 * 0.9 = 792.

However, it's round 1, and there's a discount factor of 0.9 to consider in future rounds. I could potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider what Player 1 is offering me: [1, 1, 2, 6, 0].\nThis means Player 1 gets:\n* Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1 unit.\n* Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units.\n* Item 3: 7 - 2 = 5 units.\n* Item 4: 7 - 6 = 1 unit.\n* Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units.\n\nI don't know Player 1's values, so it's difficult to perfectly optimize.

My focus will then be on keeping more of the higher-value items:\n- Trying to keep all 3 units of item 1 (value = 276)\n- Trying to keep all 3 units of item 2 (value = 219)\n- Trying to keep at least 1-2 units of item 5, as it balances between high value and not massive total units.\n\nThis initial offer must leave me with possession values over 629 (considering gamma), ensuring if no further changes happen, I'm better off. Maximizing my retention of high-value items is critical.\n\nI'll propose:\n- My offering gives Player 2 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5\n\nOffer Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1 (I keep it all because it has the highest value for me)\n- 0 units of item 2 (I keep it all because it is second highest value for me)\n- 3 units of item 3 (total value = 0 for me, maximizing what I can give away)\n- 4 units of item 4 (retaining a single unit, ensuring good shares)\n- 2 units of item 5 (keeping 3 with a decisional fallback margin)\n\nTherefore, my offer [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] becomes:\n- [0, 0, 3, 4, 2]\n\nThis offer is strategically positioning me to leverage my high-value interests while integrating adequate allocation to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 4, 2]}\n```",

However, I need to consider the discounted value in future rounds.\n\nLet's see what a potentially better counteroffer could be. I want to give Player 1 items they value less and keep items I value more. Items I highly value are items 4 and 5. I need at least 744/0.9 = 826.67 value in round 2 or 744/0.9^2 = 919.75 value in round 3.\n\nLet's try to create an offer where I get more of items 4 and 5. A good starting point is to offer player 1 all items of type 1, 2, and 3. Then allocate item 4 and 5 such that my value will be above 826.\n\nI can try to give player 1 the following: item 1:3, item 2:3, item 3:3. Then I have item 4:5, item 5:5. My value for these is 5*73 + 5*81 = 365+405 = 770. This is smaller than 826.67. Therefore I should keep more items from type 4 and 5.\n\nLet's try to give player 1 the following: item 1:3, item 2:3, item 3:3, item 4:1. Then I have item 4:4, item 5:5. My value for these is 4*73 + 5*81 = 292+405 = 697. This is smaller than 826.67.\n\nLet's try to give player 1 the following: item 1:3, item 2:3, item 3:3, item 4:0, item 5:0. Then I have item 4:5, item 5:5. My value for these is 5*73 + 5*81 = 365+405 = 770. This is smaller than 826.67.\n\nTherefore it is better to wait for the last round.\n\nIn the final round, I can try to offer him all item 1, 2, 3.\n\nNow consider a very simple counter offer where I ask for everything.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 3, 5, 5]}\n",

I need to evaluate whether a counter offer can be beneficial.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 close to what they want so that I retain more value for myself than 744/0.9 which I will compare with what I get if I accept the current offer. Player 1's offer is [1, 1, 3, 3, 2]. So that means I would give them as close to [2,2,0,2,3] as I can. Let me see how my overall value changes.\n\nIf I give Player 1 [2, 2, 0, 2, 3], that means I get [1, 1, 3, 3, 2]. My value is equal to what they are offering me right now. So I would get [1,1,3,3,2]. \nMy discounted value in round 2 will be 622 * 0.9 = 559.8 which is less than my outside offer of 744, therefore not beneficial.\n\nSo instead let me compare with walking away from the deal since its higher.\n\n**Action:**\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

A possible strategy is to offer fewer high-value items to me and more of items that might be less valuable to the opponent.\n\nOne initial strategy is to offer relatively fewer sets of items with lower values to me. Items that could likely be of lower value to me based on overall spread could be item 1 (low relative value), as its number is higher, and item 4 or 5 if it benefits me to hold on to more high-value items:\n\nOne reasonable counteroffer could be:\n\n- Offer all units of item 1, which are potentially less valuable due to their relative multiplier advantage due to number and value diminishing returns.\n- Offer 1 unit of item 4.\n- Keep all units of items 2, 3 and 5.\n\nLet\u2019s compute how this leaves me in terms of item value:\n- I offer: [6 (Item 1), 0 (Item 2), 0 (Item 3), 1 (Item 4), 0 (Item 5)]\n- My retained items by value:\n  - Item 1: 0 units, value: 0\n  - Item 2: 3 units, value: 294\n  - Item 3: 5 units, value: 365\n  - Item 4: 3 units, value: 213\n  - Item 5: 4 units, value: 320\n- Total retained value: 1192\n\nSince 1192 (before discounting) is lower than my outside offer of 860, and considering the potential negotiation gain and the higher negotiation value likely favors more realistic expected values on both sides, this offer gives me leverage with enough margin to further adjust without conceding an outright higher open-ended potential loss per gamma round.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [6, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Round:** 1\n*   **My Values:** Item 1: 43, Item 2: 12, Item 3: 88, Item 4: 76, Item 5: 50\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 1180\n*   **Current Offer to Me:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 0\n*   **Gamma (Discount Factor):** 0.9\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer:**\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n\n*   6 units of Item 1: 6 * 43 = 258\n*   0 units of Item 2: 0 * 12 = 0\n*   0 units of Item 3: 0 * 88 = 0\n*   1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 76 = 76\n*   0 units of Item 5: 0 * 50 = 0\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 258 + 0 + 0 + 76 + 0 = 334\n\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. Therefore, the present value of the current offer is 334 * 1 = 334.\n\n**Comparing to Outside Offer:**\n\nMy outside offer is worth 1180. The current offer of 334 is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer:**\n\nI need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer might look like. Player 1 is offering me almost all of item 1, so let's see if I can get more of items 3, 4, and 5, where my valuations are significantly higher.\n\nMy total value for all the items is 1238. Player 1 gave me 334. That leaves 904 for Player 1. It could be that Player 1 is happy with such deal.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe current offer (334) is far below my outside offer (1180). Therefore, accepting is not a good option. Let's try to make a counteroffer. The goal of the counteroffer is to signal my own values while giving player 1 enough to accept.\n\nLet's offer Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.  This means I would get 6 item 1, 3 item 2, 3 item 3, 4 item 4, 4 item 5.\n\nValue to me is 6 * 43 + 3 * 12 + 3 * 88 + 4 * 76 + 4 * 50 = 258 + 36 + 264 + 304 + 200 = 1062. Since my outside offer is 1180, this is below it. Need to improve this.\n\nLet's offer Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.  This means I would get 6 item 1, 3 item 2, 4 item 3, 4 item 4, 4 item 5.\n\nValue to me is 6 * 43 + 3 * 12 + 4 * 88 + 4 * 76 + 4 * 50 = 258 + 36 + 352 + 304 + 200 = 1150. Close to outside offer, but still below it.\n\nLet's offer Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.  This means I would get 6 item 1, 3 item 2, 5 item 3, 4 item 4, 4 item 5.\n\nValue to me is 6 * 43 + 3 * 12 + 5 * 88 + 4 * 76 + 4 * 50 = 258 + 36 + 440 + 304 + 200 = 1238. Equal to the total value of the items.\n\nI want to get as close to my outside offer as possible.\n\nLet's try offering 0 item 1, 0 item 2, 1 item 3, 0 item 4, 0 item 5.\n\nThis would mean I get: 6 item 1, 3 item 2, 4 item 3, 4 item 4, 4 item 5. Value for me: 6 * 43 + 3 * 12 + 4 * 88 + 4 * 76 + 4 * 50 = 1150.\nValue for Player 1: 1 * 88 = 88.\n\nSince this is the first round, I want to see if I can push for a better offer. I should offer a bit less to Player 1.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1. Player 1 has offered me [1, 2, 1, 0, 0] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My values for these items are 59, 65, 99, 47, and 86, respectively. My outside offer is 980. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 59) + (2 * 65) + (1 * 99) + (0 * 47) + (0 * 86) = 59 + 130 + 99 + 0 + 0 = 288\n\nSince it's round 1, the value of the offer is 288 * (0.9^(1-1)) = 288 * 1 = 288. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 980.\n\nTherefore, I should consider making a counteroffer or walking away. Before making a counteroffer I should consider that the offer is unlikely to be so generous in the later rounds and that the discount factor will apply to the later rounds.\n\nSince it is round 1, it is reasonable to assume that the player 1 doesn't know about my outside offer. Let's consider a simple counteroffer. I want to make it such that I get close to my outside offer.\n\nA counteroffer is what I offer to Player 1. That means the amount I keep is the total number of items available minus the counteroffer amount. So the value of what I keep is:\n(3 - offer1) * 59 + (5 - offer2) * 65 + (4 - offer3) * 99 + (1 - offer4) * 47 + (5 - offer5) * 86\n\nI should offer the other player my least valued items, and keep my most valued ones. Let's see, my values are:\n59 for item 1, 65 for item 2, 99 for item 3, 47 for item 4, 86 for item 5.\nMy least valued item is item 4, followed by item 1 and item 2. I only have one unit of item 4 so let's just offer it.\nMy counteroffer should have the form: [x, y, z, 1, w]\nThen the total value of what I keep is:\n(3-x)*59 + (5-y)*65 + (4-z)*99 + (1-1)*47 + (5-w)*86\n\nThe total number of items is 3+5+4+1+5 = 18\nMy total value of items is 3*59 + 5*65 + 4*99 + 1*47 + 5*86 = 177 + 325 + 396 + 47 + 430 = 1375\n\nI want my value to be at least 980. I can start by suggesting equal division of my best items to the other player, since I will still have a higher value than walking away.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I offer the other player [1, 2, 1, 1, 2].\nThen my value will be (3-1)*59 + (5-2)*65 + (4-1)*99 + (1-1)*47 + (5-2)*86 = 2*59 + 3*65 + 3*99 + 0 + 3*86 = 118 + 195 + 297 + 0 + 258 = 868\nThis is still less than 980. Let's adjust.\n\nLet's offer the player [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nThen I get a value of (3-0)*59 + (5-0)*65 + (4-0)*99 + (1-1)*47 + (5-0)*86 = 3*59 + 5*65 + 4*99 + 0 + 5*86 = 177 + 325 + 396 + 0 + 430 = 1328. This is > 980.\n\nOkay. I think I will offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If I counteroffer and we reach a deal in a later round, the value will be discounted by gamma^(r-1). So, I need to consider if I can get a better deal by counteroffering.\n\nSince it is the first round, let's figure out the maximum I would give player 1 to accept an offer.\nPlayer 1 offered me [1, 2, 0, 0, 1]. So he gets [3, 4, 3, 1, 2]. Let's call player 1 values p1_i.\n\nLet's assume p1_i are all 101 (the max).  In that case player 1 gets 3*101 + 4*101 + 3*101 + 1*101 + 2*101 = 13*101 = 1313.\nEven if I give him everything he gets at most 1313, so I don't need to try to find an offer that gives him more than his outside option.\n\nSo I should make a counteroffer to try and extract as much value as possible. I want items 1, 3.\n\nLet me think about a possible counteroffer: Let's offer him [3, 4, 3, 1, 2].  This would mean I get [1, 2, 0, 0, 1]. Then I get the previous value of 281. I want more value.\n\nOkay, if I offer him nothing, I get all the items. So my value is 4*98 + 6*57 + 3*92 + 1*56 + 3*69 = 392 + 342 + 276 + 56 + 207 = 1273.\n\nSince I can walk and get 1178, let's make sure my counteroffer is such that the remaining value is greater than 1178. My plan is to extract as much value from player 1 as possible, while making sure my value is > 1178 * 0.9\n\nSo, in the first round, I make a counteroffer where I ask for a large proportion of items 1, 3. Let's say, I ask for [0,0,0,0,0] meaning I get all.\nPlayer 1 gets [4,6,3,1,3]. Value is 4*98 + 6*57 + 3*92 + 1*56 + 3*69 = 1273\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 6, 3, 1, 3]}\n",

This means they are keeping 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 89\n- Item 2: 66\n- Item 3: 93\n- Item 4: 39\n- Item 5: 7\nMy outside offer is 670.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer:\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 93 = 93\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 * 39 = 117\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 * 7 = 21\nTotal value of the offer: 93 + 117 + 21 = 231\n\nSince my outside offer is 670, accepting the current offer of 231 is significantly worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. My goal is to get a deal that's better than my outside offer, taking into account the discount factor in later rounds.  In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nI want to make an offer that is appealing to Player 1 while also giving me more than 670. Let's consider offering Player 1 a deal where I keep most of the valuable items and give them the less valuable ones. Since Player 1 offered me some of item 3, item 4, and item 5, they might value these items highly. Let's assume they value these items enough to want more of them, but less than my outside offer to them.\n\nI have 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 4 of item 5 to give away in total.\nThey offered me [0, 0, 1, 3, 3].\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I give Player 1 all of item 1, item 2, and keep all of item 3, item 4, item 5.\nThis would be a counteroffer of [3, 1, 0, 0, 0].\nMy gain would be 4 * 93 + 5 * 39 + 4 * 7 = 372 + 195 + 28 = 595\nThis is not good enough as it is still less than my outside offer 670.\n\nLet's see how much I can improve the counteroffer by giving them a bit less of the valuable items. I will offer player 1 2 of item 1, and 0 of everything else: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\nValue = 1 * 89 + 1 * 66 + 4 * 93 + 5 * 39 + 4 * 7 = 89 + 66 + 372 + 195 + 28 = 750.

Player 2 would keep 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n\n**Round 2 Offer:**\n\n*   Player 1 is now offering [1, 0, 1, 3, 3] to Player 2. This means Player 1 keeps 3-1=2 of item 1, 1-0=1 of item 2, 4-1=3 of item 3, 5-3=2 of item 4, and 4-3=1 of item 5.\n\n**Evaluating the Current Offer:**\n\nLet's calculate the value of Player 2's current offer:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 89 = 89\n*   0 units of item 2: 0 * 66 = 0\n*   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 93 = 93\n*   3 units of item 4: 3 * 39 = 117\n*   3 units of item 5: 3 * 7 = 21\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 89 + 0 + 93 + 117 + 21 = 320\n\nSince this is round 2, we need to discount the value by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\n\nDiscounted value of the current offer: 320 * 0.9 = 288\n\n**Comparing to the Outside Offer:**\n\nPlayer 2's outside offer is 670. This is significantly better than the current discounted offer of 288.\n\n**Considering a Counteroffer:**\n\nTo make a worthwhile counteroffer, Player 2 needs to propose something that is more attractive to Player 1 than what Player 1 would receive by rejecting the counteroffer and heading to the last round and Player 2 needs to get more than 670/0.9 = 744.444, which seems impossible to do given the value of each item and the relatively low value of item 5.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the outside offer provides a much higher value than the discounted current offer, the best action is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

My private values are 72 for item 1, 78 for item 2, 80 for item 3, 21 for item 4, and 11 for item 5. My outside offer is 21. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(0 * 72) + (1 * 78) + (2 * 80) + (1 * 21) + (3 * 11) = 0 + 78 + 160 + 21 + 33 = 292\n\nSince this is round 1, the value of accepting this offer is 292 * (0.9^(1-1)) = 292.\n\nNow, let's consider what a good counteroffer might look like. I have 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 7 units of item 5. My total value for all the items is 1180, so I need to be careful not to give away too much. My outside option is only 21, so I really need to aim to get a deal here.\n\nI need to decide if I should accept the offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer. Since 292 is significantly better than my outside offer of 21, I would prefer to get a deal done. However, perhaps I can get an even better deal with a counteroffer. Since it is the first round, I have room to negotiate.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 roughly half of each item. A possible counteroffer could be [2, 1, 3, 0, 3]. This would leave me with [2, 2, 4, 1, 4]. The value of this to me is: (2 * 72) + (2 * 78) + (4 * 80) + (1 * 21) + (4 * 11) = 144 + 156 + 320 + 21 + 44 = 685\n\nIn this scenario, the value for Player 1 would need to be high enough such that the deal is profitable for them to accept.\n\nIf I make a counteroffer of [2, 1, 3, 0, 3], Player 1 will need to decide whether to accept it. If Player 1 walks away, they get their outside option. If Player 1 counteroffers back, I have to decide whether to accept that in round 2 (discounted by 0.9). If I reject and counteroffer in round 3 (which is treated as a walk), I get my outside option.\n\nSince the current offer is much better than my outside option, it's tempting to accept. However, the potential to get more is there. In order to potentially secure a greater portion of the items, I will offer a more conservative counter offer.\n\nLet's try to counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This leaves me with [3, 3, 6, 1, 6]. My value would then be: (3 * 72) + (3 * 78) + (6 * 80) + (1 * 21) + (6 * 11) = 216 + 234 + 480 + 21 + 66 = 1017\n\nThis offer leaves me with significantly more than the initial offer and still offers a value for the other player. I think this represents a viable approach and warrants a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's break down this negotiation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer on the table: [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]. This means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are: 28 for item 1, 24 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 96 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is: (1 * 28) + (0 * 24) + (0 * 17) + (1 * 96) + (2 * 15) = 28 + 0 + 0 + 96 + 30 = 154.\n\nMy outside offer is 451. Since this is round 1, and the discount factor is 0.9, any deal I accept needs to be worth at least 451 to me.  Since the current offer is worth 154, I should reject it.\n\nNow, I need to consider making a counteroffer. I need to decide how to divide the items to maximize my expected value, taking into account Player 1's possible responses and the discount factor. This is tricky without knowing Player 1's values.\n\nSince this is the first round, and I have a strong outside offer, I should make a counteroffer that favors me significantly. I want to signal that I value the items highly.\n\nTotal items: 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\n\nI will offer Player 1 a small amount of items I don't value as much, and keep most of the items I value more. Let's try offering: [3, 0, 1, 2, 4].  This leaves me with: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My value for this would be: (1*28) + (1*24) + (1*17) + (1*96) + (2*15) = 28 + 24 + 17 + 96 + 30 = 195.\n\nPlayer 1 receives:\nItem 1: 3 * their value\nItem 3: 1 * their value\nItem 4: 2 * their value\nItem 5: 4 * their value\n\nMy value for this is 195 * 0.9^(1-1) = 195. This is less than my outside offer. I need to consider the values better.\n\nSince I value item 4 the highest, I should keep as much of it as possible. Also item 1. So, lets make an offer that favors me more. [3,1,2,3,6]. This is offering everything to the other player! Thus my own value would be 0. This is not good.\n\nLet's try to give away most of the items except item 4, since I value that highly. I'll also keep some of item 1 to be safe. Offer = [3, 0, 2, 2, 5]. I keep [1,1,0,1,1]. Then I would have 1*28 + 1*24 + 0*17 + 1*96 + 1*15 = 163.\n\nIf I believe that there is a high chance that we can come to an agreement, I might make a more generous offer. However, I'm still tempted to walk and take my outside offer.\n\nI will try the following: offer Player 1 [3, 0, 1, 2, 4]. Thus my value is 195.\n\nSince it's the first round, I can afford to be a little greedy, hoping to anchor the negotiation in my favor.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 1, 2, 4]}\n```",

Therefore, my options are to either WALK or to make a COUNTEROFFER that would result in an outcome more valuable than my outside offer when discounted to round 3, factoring in the additional discount (\u03b3 = 0.9^2).\n\nTo make a counteroffer, I need a division where my resulting value (when discounted) would be higher than my outside offer or at least above my discounted threshold for round 3:\n\nNext round's discount would be \u03b3 = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\nThe minimum total value I need in round 3 where discounted value would be equal to or greater than my outside offer:\nValue_needed \u00d7 0.81 = 749\nValue_needed = 749 / 0.81 \u2248 924.69\n\nSince the maximum value of all items is 1026 (my total valuation), getting an outcome with a higher immediate value than the discounted required value (924.69) is unlikely given also what Agent 2's valuations might be and the structure of your current needs.\n\nWith this understanding, realistically gaining an outcome above the discounted threshold set, while factoring in realistic interests of the other player and given the negotiation setup\u2014 it's reasonable to choose to WALK because:\n\n1.

Therefore, I need to ensure that any offer I accept or propose results in a value greater than 536.\n\nConsidering the current situation:\n- This is the first round, so the negotiation value hasn\u2019t been discounted yet (gamma = 1 for round 1).\n\nI should aim to prioritize items that provide me with the highest value relative to the number of units available, which are items 2 and 4. However, I also should give some value back to Player 2 in hopes of achieving cooperation.\n\nInitial Counteroffer Strategy:\n- Aim to secure the high-value items for myself (items 2 and 4).\n- Offer a reasonable distribution of other items to Player 2.\n\nLet's consider an initial counteroffer:\n- Give Player 2: \n  - 1 unit of item 1 \n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- 2 units of item 1 (value: 2 * 52 = 104)\n- 3 units of item 2 (value: 3 * 87 = 261)\n- 5 units of item 3 (value: 5 * 12 = 60)\n- 2 units of item 4 (value: 2 * 89 = 178)\n- 2 units of item 5 (value: 2 * 74 = 148)\n\nTotal value for me from this offer = 104 + 261 + 60 + 178 + 148 = 751, which is greater than my outside option of 536.\n\nHere is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

Since 309 < 327, accepting the offer would give me less value than walking away.\n\nHowever, it's only round 1, so I should consider making a counteroffer. The total number of items are 3, 5, 7, 3, and 2. I want to maximize my value, and the other player wants to maximize their value. I can offer something that is a little worse than my outside offer, such that it still provides me with value above my outside offer, but is still attractive enough for the other player.\nThe total value of all the items is 3 * 66 + 5 * 9 + 7 * 77 + 3 * 89 + 2 * 83 = 198 + 45 + 539 + 267 + 166 = 1215. If the offer is accepted in round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nLet's evaluate the current offer for the other player.\nPlayer 1 offered me [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]. Therefore, Player 1 gets:\nItem 1: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 2: 5 - 0 = 5\nItem 3: 7 - 2 = 5\nItem 4: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 5: 2 - 0 = 2\nSo Player 1 gets [2, 5, 5, 2, 2]. Player 1's values are unknown, so I cannot say if this is good for them.\n\nI need to make an offer to maximize my value.\nI will offer Player 1 an offer that gives me 330 in value. That is, a little more than my outside option (327).\nMy total value is 1215.\n\nSuppose I offer the other player [0, 5, 7, 0, 0]. This would give me [3, 0, 0, 3, 2].\nMy value would be (3 * 66) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 77) + (3 * 89) + (2 * 83) = 198 + 0 + 0 + 267 + 166 = 631. This is much more than 330.\nI want an offer that provides me with at least 327 in value. Let's try to offer the other player [1, 3, 5, 1, 1]. Then, I will keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]. My value will be (2 * 66) + (2 * 9) + (2 * 77) + (2 * 89) + (1 * 83) = 132 + 18 + 154 + 178 + 83 = 565, which is greater than 327.\n\nI will offer Player 1 [1, 3, 5, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 5, 1, 1]}\n```",

It's risky since if we reach round 3 and I make a counteroffer, that is treated as a walk, so it is very important that if I make a counteroffer here I get Player 1 to accept in Round 3.\n\nThe total amount of items are: 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\nPlayer 1's current offer to me is [0, 2, 7, 1, 1].\nThis means Player 1 gets: [3, 3, 0, 2, 1].\n\nIf I accept now, Player 1 gets [3, 3, 0, 2, 1]. What would Player 1 value this at? We don't know exactly but we know that Player 1 has some value between 1 and 101 for each of the items.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 2. The current offer on the table is [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], meaning Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My values are 93 for item 1, 14 for item 2, 89 for item 3, 53 for item 4, and 55 for item 5. My outside offer is 726.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 93) + (1 * 14) + (1 * 89) + (0 * 53) + (1 * 55) = 93 + 14 + 89 + 0 + 55 = 251\n\nSince this is round 1, there is no discounting yet (gamma^0 = 1).\n\nNow, let's consider the total number of items: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\n\nIf I accept the offer, I get a value of 251. If I walk away, I get my outside offer of 726. Clearly, walking away is better than accepting at this point.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1. I should consider making a counteroffer. To make a reasonable counteroffer, I need to estimate what Player 1's values might be. Since they are drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 101, I can assume their average value per item is around 51. I should also consider what I want. I want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 enough to accept.\n\nLet's consider a possible counteroffer where I give Player 1: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. This means I would keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This results in the offer [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] to me, which is the current offer, so not useful.\n\nLet's try something that biases more toward the items I value less. Let's consider giving Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. That would leave me with 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. My value would be (3 * 93) + (4 * 14) + (6 * 89) + (0 * 53) + (5 * 55) = 279 + 56 + 534 + 0 + 275 = 1144.\n\nIf I make this counteroffer, I need to consider whether Player 1 is likely to accept.\nIf I give Player 1 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, they get 2 units of item 4. Assuming their value of item 4 is near the average of 51, that is about 102 value for them. This might be a good starting point to get the negotiation going and feel out what they really want, versus walking away.\n\nSo, my reasoning is: accepting is bad, walking away is better than accepting, but trying a counteroffer is potentially even better if it leads to a deal where I get more value than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

This is the minimum value I must receive to consider any negotiated outcome better than walking away.\n\n### Initial Strategy:\nGiven my high valuation of item 2 (100 per unit), item 5 (71 per unit), and a fairly high private outside offer, I should prioritize keeping as many of these items as possible.\n\n### Formulating a Counteroffer:\nI will construct an offer that leaves me with a value higher than my outside offer while still distributing some value to the other player:\n- I want to retain all of item 2 as they are most valuable to me.\n- I can offer some of item 1, item 3, item 4, and item 5, as long as my retained value exceeds my outside offer.\n\n#### Proposed Offer:\n- Give 2 of item 1 to Player 2. (Retain 1 for 17 value)\n- Give 0 of item 2 to Player 2. (Retain 8 for 800 value)\n- Give 0 of item 3 to Player 2. (Retain 1 for 74 value)\n- Give 4 of item 4 to Player 2. (Retain 1 for 15 value)\n- Give 3 of item 5 to Player 2. (Retain 2 for 142 value)\n\n#### Calculating My Retained Value:\n- Retained item 1 value: 1 * 17 = 17\n- Retained item 2 value: 8 * 100 = 800\n- Retained item 3 value: 1 * 74 = 74\n- Retained item 4 value: 1 * 15 = 15\n- Retained item 5 value: 2 * 71 = 142\n\nTotal Retained Value = 17 + 800 + 74 + 15 + 142 = 1048.\n\nMy retained value of 1048 is slightly below my outside offer. I should aim for a higher value, possibly by adjusting the distribution again to increase my retained value.\n\n### Adjusting the Offer:\nTo achieve a value higher than my outside offer, I need to adjust it in favor of items I value higher:\n\n- Give 1 of item 4 to Player 2. (Retain 4 for 60 value)\n\nRe-calculated Total Retained Value = 17 (item 1) + 800 (item 2) + 74 (item 3) + 60 (item 4) + 142 (item 5) = 1093.\n\nThis value is still slightly below my outside offer, but close enough to consider it a strategic play for negotiation leverage, assuming the opponent may perceive fair allocation in the initial distribution.\n\n### Final Offer:\n- Item 1: 2 to Player 2\n- Item 2: 0 to Player 2\n- Item 3: 0 to Player 2\n- Item 4: 1 to Player 2\n- Item 5: 3 to Player 2\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 1, 3]}\n```",

Clearly, I should not accept the current offer.\n\nNow let's think about making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while also making the offer attractive enough for Player 1 to accept. I need to estimate Player 1's values to determine a plausible offer.

Player 1 currently gets: item 1: 2, item 2: 0, item 3: 0, item 4: 1, item 5: 3\n\nThis means that I have:\n- Item 1: 3-2 = 1\n- Item 2: 8-0 = 8\n- Item 3: 1-0 = 1\n- Item 4: 5-1 = 4\n- Item 5: 5-3 = 2\n\nNow, I need to decide on a reasonable counteroffer. Since I value item 3 the highest (96), I would like to keep it. My next highest is item 5 (79) and item 2 (28). I can try offering player 1 most of item 1 and item 4. For Item 1, I will offer them one more to make it 3 total and Item 4 I will offer them 4 to make it 5 total.

However, negotiating with an offer of zero items is not beneficial because there's no mutual agreement reflected in this offer.\n\n2. **My Private Values**:\n   - Item 1: 17 per unit\n   - Item 2: 100 per unit\n   - Item 3: 74 per unit\n   - Item 4: 15 per unit\n   - Item 5: 71 per unit\n\n3. **Total Value of Items**: \n   - Calculating using my values, the entire set of items would be valued at:\n     - \\(3 \\times 17 = 51\\) for Item 1,\n     - \\(8 \\times 100 = 800\\) for Item 2,\n     - \\(1 \\times 74 = 74\\) for Item 3,\n     - \\(5 \\times 15 = 75\\) for Item 4,\n     - \\(5 \\times 71 = 355\\) for Item 5.\n   - Total of my own values: 51 + 800 + 74 + 75 + 355 = 1355.\n\n4. **Outside Offer and Negotation Incentive**:\n   - My guaranteed outside offer is 1098.\n   - With a gamma of 0.9, the discount factor doesn't fully outweigh my outside offer in this round unless I can ensure a value greater than 1098 gained through negotiation.\n\n5. **Counteroffer Consideration**:\n   - I need to propose an offer likely accepted by Player 2, while also ensuring I retain enough value above 1098.\n   - My strategy should take into account maximizing my value of items while appearing fair to Player 2.\n\n6. **Propose Counteroffer**:\n   - I can consider offering a larger share of lower value items for me and retaining higher value items like Item 2 and Item 5. This would allow me to secure a high value share.\n   - Formulate an offer to balance fairness and my valuation:\n     - Suggested offer: [1, 4, 0, 3, 2].

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [1, 4, 0, 3, 2] of items 1 through 5, respectively. My private values are 19, 28, 96, 3, and 79 for items 1 through 5. My outside offer is 706. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 19) + (4 * 28) + (0 * 96) + (3 * 3) + (2 * 79) = 19 + 112 + 0 + 9 + 158 = 298\n\nNow, let's consider the consequences of each action:\n\n*   **ACCEPT:** I get a value of 298, discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So my value is 298 * 0.9 = 268.2\n*   **WALK:** I get my outside offer of 706.\n*   **COUNTEROFFER:** If I make a counteroffer, we move to round 3 (the last round). If Player 1 rejects my counteroffer, I get my outside offer discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81. So my value is 706 * 0.81 = 571.86\n\nSince my outside offer is 706, and accepting gives me 268.2, walking gives me 706, and counteroffering and potentially walking away in round 3 gives me 571.86, it's clear that I should either walk away or construct a beneficial counteroffer.\n\nTo decide whether to make a counteroffer, I need to evaluate how Player 1 values the items. I don't know Player 1's values, but I can assume they are rational.\n\nLet's think about my ideal scenario. I want to maximize my value while ensuring Player 1 gets at least their outside option value.\n\nCurrent offer gives me 268.2 and gives Player 1:\nItem 1: 3-1 = 2\nItem 2: 8-4 = 4\nItem 3: 1-0 = 1\nItem 4: 5-3 = 2\nItem 5: 5-2 = 3\n\nNow, let's try to craft a counteroffer. My highest value items are item 3 and item 5. My lowest value item is item 4.\n\nThe aim is to beat the outside offer (706). I need (n1 * 19) + (n2 * 28) + (n3 * 96) + (n4 * 3) + (n5 * 79) > 706/0.9 = 784.44.\n\nLet's try to offer them almost everything and keep the items I value the most. How about I offer them: [2, 7, 1, 4, 4].\nThis means I get: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. The value to me is: (1 * 19) + (1 * 28) + (0 * 96) + (1 * 3) + (1 * 79) = 19 + 28 + 0 + 3 + 79 = 129. Discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81 is 104.49. This is worse than walking away, so not an improvement.\n\nBased on the current offer's low value (268.2) compared to my outside option (706), and considering the pessimistic outcome of a rejected counteroffer (571.86), it is best to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Thus, my offer could look like this:\n\n1. Offer all units of item 2 (7 units x 5 value = 35 total value) since its value is lowest.\n2. Offer a couple of units from items that contribute less to my preferred value but still entice Player 2.\n   \nSo, my proposed offer:\n- Item 1: Offer 2 out of 6 units to Player 2 (keeping 4)\n- Item 2: Offer all 7 units to Player 2\n- Item 3: Offer 2 out of 5 units to Player 2 (keeping 3)\n- Item 4: Offer 0 units\n- Item 5: Offer 0 units\n\nThis offer makes my total retained value:\n- \\(4 \\times 33 + 0 \\times 5 + 3 \\times 51 + 1 \\times 93 + 1 \\times 56 = 475\\)\n\nThis value is close to my outside offer, considering the discount in future rounds (0.9^0 = 1, no discount applies yet).

If I accept, I get 274. If I walk, I get 289.\n\nHowever, it's only round 1, so there's room for negotiation. Let's consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to get a deal better than 289.\n\nTo formulate a counteroffer, I need to think about what Player 1 might value. Let's consider the extremes: if Player 1 valued every item at the lowest possible value (1), their total value would be 6+7+5+1+1 = 20. If Player 1 valued every item at the highest possible value (101), their total value would be 606+707+505+101+101 = 2020. This means their outside offer could be anywhere from 1 to 2020, but we don't know it.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 \"enough\" value for them to accept, but also gives me more than my outside offer, taking the discount factor into account for future rounds.\n\nI will try to aim for a value of at least 322.22 to me, discounted back it's ~289. Let's test by giving Player 1 the items I value the least and see how that works out for me.\nLet's assume a counteroffer of [4, 0, 0, 1, 1]. Player 1 would receive:\n4 of Item 1\n0 of Item 2\n0 of Item 3\n1 of Item 4\n1 of Item 5\nI would receive:\n2 of Item 1\n7 of Item 2\n5 of Item 3\n0 of Item 4\n0 of Item 5\nMy value would be: (2 * 20) + (7 * 26) + (5 * 26) = 40 + 182 + 130 = 352.

The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(3 * 20) + (3 * 26) + (2 * 26) + (0 * 19) + (0 * 40) = 60 + 78 + 52 + 0 + 0 = 190\n\nSince it is round 2, if I accept, the value will be discounted by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of accepting the current offer is 190 * 0.9 = 171.\n\nMy outside offer is 289. Since 171 < 289, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 something that they will accept, but also gives me a better outcome than walking away.\nIf this was round 3, I would just walk away, since making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away. But it is round 2, so I have the opportunity to make another offer.\n\nI have the following amounts of each item:\n- Item 1: 6\n- Item 2: 7\n- Item 3: 5\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 1\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me: [3, 3, 2, 0, 0]\nSo currently Player 1 gets:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 1\n\nIn order to improve upon my outside offer, I need to aim for a discounted value of higher than 289.\nSo I need 1/0.9 of 289, roughly 322.2 in value *before* the discount.\nI can try to give player 1 as little as possible, while ensuring that I get a better outcome than walking away.\n\nI need at least 322.2 / 0.9 = 358 (approx). 358 / 1.2, roughly\nI can construct the following offer:\n\nLet's calculate a possible offer where I get more than 322.2 value:\nI give [0, 4, 3, 1, 1] to Player 1. This means I keep [6, 3, 2, 0, 0]\nMy value would then be: 6*20 + 3*26 + 2*26 = 120 + 78 + 52 = 250.  This is clearly not better than walking away.\n\nIf I give [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. Then I get [6, 7, 5, 1, 1]. Which has a total value of 6*20 + 7*26 + 5*26 + 1*19 + 1*40 = 120 + 182 + 130 + 19 + 40 = 491.\nValue after discount = 491 * 0.9 = 441.9\n\nI have to offer something to player 1 for them to accept.

The current offer (591) is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n**Considering Future Rounds**\n\nSince this is round 1, there are two more rounds. If I reject the current offer, I have to consider the discount factor (gamma = 0.9). The maximum I can achieve in the next round is my total valuation (891) times the discount factor (0.9) and in the last round times the discount factor (0.9^2).\nThis will give me at most 801.9 in round 2 and 721.71 in round 3.\n\n**Decision**\n\nGiven that the current offer (591) is already substantially better than my outside offer (337) and, realistically, I can't expect to get too much closer to my total valuation, accepting the current offer is the best strategy.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

The counteroffer will be aimed to keep a substantial portion of high-value items and still encourage the acceptance possibility by Player 2.\n\n**Strategic Offer:**\nTo maximize my value, prioritize keeping more from high-value items (1 and 4) and offer more of low-value items to Player 2 in hope it satisfies them. Since there's no current competing offer, my initial offer needs some level of compromise to initiate negotiation adequately.\n\n**Propose to Offer:**\n- Item 1: 1 unit (keep 3 units = 3*76 = 228)\n- Item 2: 2 units (keep 2 units = 2*36 = 72)\n- Item 3: 2 units (give away all, value 10)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (keep 3 units = 3*66 = 198)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (keep 1 unit = 1*62 = 62)\n\n**Calculation of Value in Offer:**\nMy retained value = 228 + 72 + 0 + 198 + 62 = 560\nThis value well exceeds the outside offer of 367.\n\nConclusion: Considering the value gained and potential negotiation rounds, I'll move forward with this initial offer which allows compromise yet retains significant value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

If I make a counteroffer and it's rejected, in the next round the discounted value of my outside option is 0.9 * 633 = 569.7\n\nLet's consider what a reasonable counteroffer might look like. I want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 enough to accept. I have 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 2 units of item 5. Player 1 is currently offering me 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.

I think I will make a counteroffer that guarantees me at least my outside option value of 633 * 0.9 = 569.7 in the next round.\n\nTo get at least 569.7 in the next round, I will create a counteroffer that gives me a current value of 633.\n\nLet's consider this strategy.\nSince I need 633, I will try to construct an offer that gives that.\nIf I take everything in item 4, item 5 and item 3 and some of items 1 and 2. That is 4*90+2*70+2*74=360+140+148 = 648. That is greater than my outside option of 633. I will give Player 1 just item 1 and item 2 in the counteroffer.

I should aim to secure items with the highest personal value:\n\n### Initial Offer:\nI will make an offer leaving Player 2 with a minimal amount of high-value items, assuming they value these differently, to optimize my own value:\n\n- Offer Player 2: \n  - 1 unit of Item 2 (leaving 1 for myself)\n  - 1 unit of Item 3 (leaving 3 for myself)\n  - 0 units of Item 4 (keeping all for myself)\n  - 3 units of Item 5 (leaving 1 for myself)\n\n### My Value Calculation based on the offer:\n- Value for me: \n  - Item 2: 1 * 39 = 39\n  - Item 3: 3 * 57 = 171\n  - Item 4: 2 * 23 = 46\n  - Item 5: 1 * 14 = 14\n\nTotal Value from keeping these items = 39 + 171 + 46 + 14 = 270\n\nThis offer ensures that my value (270) exceeds my outside offer (208) upon this distribution.

Here is a potential proposal:\n\nTo Player 2:\n- Offer them 3 units of item 1 (value to me: 3 * 39 = 117)\n- Offer them 2 units of item 2 (value to me: 2 * 68 = 136)\n- Offer them 0 units of item 3 (value to me remains 58)\n- Offer them 1 unit of item 4 (value to me: 1 * 74 = 74)\n- Offer them 1 unit of item 5 (value to me: 1 * 88 = 88)\n\nMy proposed offer to Player 2 results in:\n\n- My remaining units are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n  \nCalculating my remaining value:\n\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 39 = 78\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 * 68 = 204\n- 1 unit of item 3: 58 (since they get none)\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 74 = 148\n- 1 unit of item 5: 88 (since they get one)\n\nMy total value with this offer = 78 + 204 + 58 + 148 + 88 = 576\n\nConsidering the objectives, it is reasonable to make an offer that leaves me with a higher value than my outside offer after considering potential counteroffers and the discount factors in future rounds. However, given that my value would decrease significantly, I should reconsider my approach to achieve a more balanced value close to or exceeding 729.\n\nTherefore, the initial proposal should be structured to have a total value close to or exceeding the outside offer upon accounting for likely discounting effect in future rounds.\n\nHence, I am revising my initial offer as follows, prioritizing maintaining a value closer to or above my outside offer while still attractive to Player 2:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 0, 0]}",

Thus, the present value of accepting this offer is 288 * 0.9 = 259.2.\n\nMy outside offer is 350. So, if I walk away, I get 350.\n\nTherefore, I should only accept the offer if the discounted value is greater than my outside offer, which is 350. Currently, 259.2 < 350.\n\nNow, let's think about a possible counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 something that they will accept, while still giving me a value greater than 350 / 0.9 = 388.89. I have 5 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\nLet's try to construct an offer that is slightly better than what I offered in the last round (Round 1: [5, 0, 1, 3, 2]). If I offer similar values to Player 1, it might be more convincing for them to accept. However, offering the same again would mean an equal split, and it's already been rejected. The key is to leave enough for myself to beat 388.89 * 0.9 = 350.001, and therefore, improve the value to me.\n\nI can offer a small amount of my higher valued items, perhaps giving a little bit more of item 2. Let's try offering Player 1 [3, 3, 0, 0, 0]. This would leave me with 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. The value of this offer to me is:\n(2 * 13) + (2 * 83) + (1 * 54) + (3 * 68) + (2 * 1) = 26 + 166 + 54 + 204 + 2 = 452.\nDiscounted value is 452 * 0.9 = 406.8 which is greater than 350.\n\nLet's see if I can still make it better. Offering Player 1 a very small amount of item 2: [3, 2, 0, 0, 0] seems viable. I would be left with 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 2 of item 5. That's (2 * 13) + (3 * 83) + (1 * 54) + (3 * 68) + (2 * 1) = 26 + 249 + 54 + 204 + 2 = 535. 535 * 0.9 is 481.5 > 350.\n\nHowever, offering Player 1 only [3, 2, 0, 0, 0] may not be accepted. So I will offer [3, 3, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since I am Player 1, I can make the initial offer.\n\nFirst, I will calculate my total possible value from all items:\n\n- Item 1: 5 units * 66 value/unit = 330\n- Item 2: 3 units * 5 value/unit = 15\n- Item 3: 2 units * 67 value/unit = 134\n- Item 4: 3 units * 32 value/unit = 96\n- Item 5: 5 units * 5 value/unit = 25\n\nTotal value = 330 + 15 + 134 + 96 + 25 = 600\n\nMy outside offer value is 480. To incentivize Player 2 to agree, I should aim to maximize my value above this 480 while still providing enough incentive for Player 2 to prefer the offer over their outside option.\n\n### Strategy Development:\n\n1. **Calculate the Discounted Value for Current Round (Round 1):**\n   Discount factor for round 1 is gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so no discount is applied here since it's the initial round.\n\n2. **Constructing a Proposal:**\n   I want to offer Player 2 a selection of items with a combined perceived value that is hopefully lower for me but attractive enough for Player 2. Since I don't know Player 2's exact valuation, I can initially offer a balanced amount that leaves me with most of the items I value highly.\n\nLet's prioritize items based on my value:\n\n- Highly valued (over 50): Item 1 (66), Item 3 (67)\n- Moderate valued (20 - 50): Item 4 (32)\n- Low valued (below 20): Item 2 (5), Item 5 (5)\n\nI will make an initial offer where I keep more units of highly valued items (1, 3) and offer them more of the lower-valued items (2, 5).\n\n### Proposal:\n- Item 1: Offer 1 unit (I keep 4)\n- Item 2: Offer 3 units (I keep 0)\n- Item 3: Offer 0 units (I keep 2)\n- Item 4: Offer 1 unit (I keep 2)\n- Item 5: Offer 4 units (I keep 1)\n\nThis initial offer allows me to retain a high value while potentially being attractive enough for Player 2, assuming they might value the quantity or have different valuations. My retained value:  \n- Item 1: 4 units * 66 = 264\n- Item 2: 0 units * 5 = 0\n- Item 3: 2 units * 67 = 134\n- Item 4: 2 units * 32 = 64\n- Item 5: 1 unit * 5 = 5\n\nTotal retained value = 264 + 0 + 134 + 64 + 5 = 467\n\nSince 467 multiplied by the current discount (1) is less than my outside offer value (480), I acknowledge there might be more negotiation room in future rounds. However, this is a starting offer and leaves room for modifications or acceptance from Player 2 if they find it favorable.\n\nLet's submit this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 1, 4]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer is [1, 3, 0, 1, 4], meaning Player 1 offers me 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are 55 for item 1, 42 for item 2, 86 for item 3, 11 for item 4, 58 for item 5.\n\nMy outside offer is 544.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 55) + (3 * 42) + (0 * 86) + (1 * 11) + (4 * 58) = 55 + 126 + 0 + 11 + 232 = 424\n\nSince 424 is less than my outside offer of 544, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1, and we have two more rounds to negotiate.  I need to consider whether a counteroffer could lead to a better outcome, taking into account the discount factor of 0.9.\n\nIf I make a counteroffer, I need to give Player 1 enough to make them prefer accepting it over their outside offer (which I don't know) and over continuing to negotiate (which means they need to expect a better outcome in future rounds than they'd get now).\n\nLet's consider what would be a fair split. The total value of all items is:\n(5 * 55) + (3 * 42) + (2 * 86) + (3 * 11) + (5 * 58) = 275 + 126 + 172 + 33 + 290 = 896\n\nA \"fair\" split might be close to dividing the total value of all items roughly in half. I'm not privy to Player 1's values, so I can only approximate, and I'm only trying to exceed 544 * 0.9 = 490 in the first round.\n\nGiven my values, I want to keep as much of item 3 as possible, and give away items 4 since my value for item 4 is very low.  Let's see if I can make an offer that gives me slightly more than my outside offer now discounted by 0.9.\n\nLet's try to create an offer where I get:\nItem 1: 3 units\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 0 units\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nThis means I offer Player 1:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 2 units\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 3 units\nItem 5: 3 units\n\nValue to me: (3 * 55) + (1 * 42) + (1 * 86) + (0 * 11) + (2 * 58) = 165 + 42 + 86 + 0 + 116 = 409\nThis isn't good enough.\n\nLet's try to improve the offer. Instead of giving them 3 units of item 4, let's only give them 1 unit and keep 2 myself. Also, let's take another unit of item 5 and keep it for myself.\n\nSo now I keep:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 3\nAnd offer:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 2\n\nValue to me: (3 * 55) + (1 * 42) + (1 * 86) + (2 * 11) + (3 * 58) = 165 + 42 + 86 + 22 + 174 = 489\nStill not quite enough...\n\nLet's give up one more unit of item 3 and offer that to player 1, meaning I keep none, to increase my current standing.\n\nSo now I keep:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 3\nAnd offer:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 2\n\nValue to me: (3 * 55) + (1 * 42) + (0 * 86) + (2 * 11) + (3 * 58) = 165 + 42 + 0 + 22 + 174 = 403\n\nActually, it's better to just make a larger offer, giving them 2,2,0,1,2 instead of 1,3,0,1,4. Let's consider something in between.\n\nLet's try giving them 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5\n\nThis means I keep 4, 1, 2, 2, 3\n4 * 55 + 1 * 42 + 2 * 86 + 2 * 11 + 3 * 58 = 220 + 42 + 172 + 22 + 174 = 630\nDiscounted is 630 * 0.9 = 567\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]}\n",

However, it's round 1, so I have a chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal. I need to consider the discount factor in subsequent rounds (0.9).\n\nLet's consider what a possible counteroffer might look like. I have:\n1 unit of item 1\n3 units of item 2\n5 units of item 3\n6 units of item 4\n2 units of item 5\n\nThe total value of everything I have is 1249.\n\nPlayer 1 offered me a deal that gives me a value of 387.

My goal is to get as close to my total value as possible while offering them enough to make a deal better than walking away. Since I don't know their outside offer, I have to guess a reasonable split that is good for me.\n\nSince it's round 1, I will make a counteroffer. I will try to get a better deal for myself, but also make it attractive enough for Player 1.\nI think a good strategy is to offer Player 1 an equal amount of value in terms of the number of items.

This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  My values for these items are 49, 20, 39, 8, and 90, respectively.\n\nThe value of this offer to me is (0 * 49) + (1 * 20) + (4 * 39) + (1 * 8) + (0 * 90) = 0 + 20 + 156 + 8 + 0 = 184.\n\nMy outside offer is 720. Since 184 is significantly less than 720, accepting the current offer is not a good option.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of a counteroffer. I need to determine if there's a counteroffer that Player 1 is likely to accept, and which would give me a value greater than my outside offer when discounted. Because we are in Round 1, the discount factor will be important to consider as we could still obtain significantly more value in the long run from future rounds.\n\nSince I don't know Player 1's values, it is safest to assume that they have made a reasonable offer, and the outside offer is their reservation value. Since the discount factor will reduce all future outcomes, it's best to accept the outside offer value immediately.\n\nTherefore, my best option is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

This means the items I keep need to sum up to a total value greater than 524.\n\n### Initial Total Value of All Items:\nThe total value based on my valuation:\n- Total Value = (6 * 62) + (3 * 1) + (6 * 27) + (4 * 74) + (4 * 49) \n- Total Value = 372 + 3 + 162 + 296 + 196 \n- Total Value = 1029\n\n### Strategy:\nTo make the first offer, it's crucial to try and partition the items in a way that ensures I reach well over my outside offer if the negotiation ends after any subsequent round, factoring in the discount. Since I\u2019m initiating, I would like to offer fewer items with lower personal value and negotiate more of the high-value items.\n\n### Initial Offer Proposal:\n- Offer away most if not all, low-value items.\n- Keep more high-value items.\n\n**Proposal Structure:**\n- Offer away most units of Item 2 and Item 3 (lower value to me).\n- Retain the majority of Item 1, Item 4, and Item 5.\n\n### Offer Calculation:\nIf Player 2 gets:\n- 1 unit of Item 1 (to show willingness to share more valuable items)\n- 3 units of Item 2 (all, as it holds minimal value for me)\n- 3 units of Item 3 (half, to balance potential negotiation interests)\n- 1 unit of Item 4 (small offer to show flexibility)\n- 1 unit of Item 5 (to maintain leverage on high-value)\n\n**Items Retained by Me:**\n- 5 units of Item 1 = 310\n- 0 units of Item 2 = 0\n- 3 units of Item 3 = 81\n- 3 units of Item 4 = 222\n- 3 units of Item 5 = 147\n\nTotal value retained by me = 310 + 81 + 222 + 147 = 760\n\n### Rationale:\nThe offer I've structured allows me to potentially retain a value of 760, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 524. If accepted, even after a discount (by round three), this value still remains attractive. It provides a deal attractive enough to potentially interest Player 2, setting up grounds for successful negotiation without directly compelling me to risk ending up with an inferior value.\n\nHence, I will go with the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

My values for these items are 35, 48, 35, 87, and 89. My outside offer is 443, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 1's current offer to me:\n(3 * 35) + (3 * 48) + (2 * 35) + (0 * 87) + (3 * 89) = 105 + 144 + 70 + 0 + 267 = 586\n\nSince this is round 2, we need to discount this value by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nDiscounted value = 586 * 0.9 = 527.4\n\nMy outside offer is 443. Since 527.4 > 443, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*. However, it's round 2, and I might be able to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  The key is to figure out if a counteroffer could potentially give me more than 443/0.9 = 492.2 value to me. In other words, if I believed Player 1 would accept something giving me value greater than that I would suggest such an offer. I would do that if it gave the player more value than their outside offer.\n\nLet's think about what Player 1 is doing. I offered [5, 0, 3, 0, 0]. Player 1 responded by offering me [3, 3, 2, 0, 3]. My valuation is 586.  Player 1 *must* value item 4 highly, since they are keeping all 4 units of it. My high values are in items 4 and 5. Player 1 likely values item 5 less than I do. Given this, and given that my outside offer is 443, and given that it is discounted if I walk away.\n\nLet's see what would be the best thing that I could do to just barely exceed my outside offer if I walk in the end. If I walk now I get a value of 443. If I walk after round 3, I get 443 * .9 * .9, so the minimum value of the deal would have to exceed about 443. It would make sense to see what offer is on the table for each player given the counteroffer from the last round, and then see what I think the other player will actually accept.\n\nI should try and get as much item 4 and 5 as possible. Let's try offering them only 1 item 1, zero item 2, and only 1 of item 3 to see if I can get item 4 and item 5. This counteroffer would offer Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This would mean I would get [5, 3, 5, 4, 4] which is (5 * 35) + (3 * 48) + (5 * 35) + (4 * 87) + (4 * 89) = 175 + 144 + 175 + 348 + 356 = 1198. This is a good deal, so I should propose an offer that gets me as close to that as possible, while still being better than 0 for them.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n",

I want to make an offer that is better than my outside option but still leave some room for negotiation. This round, my discounted outside option is 350.\n\nSince Player 1 initiated with a relatively low offer, I should make a more aggressive counteroffer.

Therefore, I will only consider offers that yield me more than 1219 if the result is not discounted.\n\nIn the first round, there's no discount applied yet, and I\u2019m willing to negotiate terms that leave me slightly above my outside offer if a deal is accepted in this first round.\n\nLet's decide on an initial offer to maximize my value while still proposing a plausible division for the other player:\n\n1. I'll aim to claim the highest valued items, mainly item 2 (97 per unit) and item 3 (92 per unit), ensuring I don't undervalue other items in the process.\n\nGiven this, my strategy might be to retain all units of the more valuable items, such as item 2 and item 3, while leaving less valuable items for Player 2. To construct an enticing offer for Player 2, I can concede more units of the lower-valued items according to my valuations. \n\nTo balance things and start negotiations, here's a plausible first offer:\n\n- I keep 3 units of item 2 (291 value)\n- I keep 3 units of item 3 (276 value)\n- I share item 1 (1 unit each)\n\nNow divide the less valued items:\n\n- Offer all 11 units of item 4 (396 value, lower priority for me)\n- Offer 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 5 (a compromise on high-value item)\n\nThis would mean leaving:\n\n- Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2\n- Item 2: 0 units to Player 2\n- Item 3: 0 units to Player 2\n- Item 4: 11 units to Player 2\n- Item 5: 1 unit to Player 2\n\nHence, my initial offer will be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 11, 1]}\n``` \n\nThis leaves me with substantial value from items 2 and 3, while Player 2 gets the majority of item 4 and a unit from items 1 and 5. Clearly, I'm opening with a position that values my high-valued items while still making a significant offer to Player 2.",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and Player 1 has offered me [1, 0, 0, 11, 1], which means they want to keep [1, 3, 3, 0, 1]. My values are 84, 80, 81, 49, 79. My outside offer is 1036.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 1's offer to me:\n(1 * 84) + (0 * 80) + (0 * 81) + (11 * 49) + (1 * 79) = 84 + 0 + 0 + 539 + 79 = 702\n\nNow, let's consider what would happen if I accepted this offer. I would get a value of 702. Since my outside offer is 1036, accepting the offer is worse than walking away. However, this is round 1, so there's room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer.\n\nTo decide on a counteroffer, I need to figure out how much I need to get to make this worthwhile, considering the discount factor. Let's assume I want to get at least the equivalent of my outside offer *after* the discount. My discounted outside offer in round 2 would be 1036 / 0.9 = 1151.11, and in round 3 it would be 1036 / (0.9 * 0.9) = 1279.01. In round 1, I want to get at least 1036.\n\nI want to maximize my profit, but also make it more likely that Player 1 accepts. Let's aim for a split where I get slightly more than my outside offer.  The total value of all items is (2*84) + (3*80) + (3*81) + (11*49) + (2*79) = 168 + 240 + 243 + 539 + 158 = 1348.\n\nLet's try to get slightly more than my outside offer, so I'll aim for about 1050 in this round, and give Player 1 1348 - 1050 = 298. This will probably be too high, but I'll start here.\n\nI need to give Player 1 values such that their value for the items I give them is 298. I don't know their item values, so I need to guess. Since they kept all the item 2 and 3 initially and none of item 4, I'll keep that in mind. Let me try to offer a more reasonable offer:\nOffer Player 1 1 unit of item 1, all units of item 2 and item 3, and 1 unit of item 5. So, I keep the remaining one unit of item 1, none of item 2 or 3, 11 units of item 4, and one unit of item 5. My value is (1*84) + (11*49) + (1*79) = 84 + 539 + 79 = 702. Their value is 1348 - 702 = 646. I am not going to do this.\n\nI'll offer Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. This gives me a value of (1*84) + (0*80) + (1*81) + (11*49) + (1*79) = 84 + 81 + 539 + 79 = 783. The discount factor is 0.9.\nLet's give Player 1 0 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 unit of item 5. So, I take everything: 1348. My outside option is 1036.\n\nI will try giving them 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n",

My private values are 98, 91, 30, 94, and 90 respectively.\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 98) + (1 * 91) + (4 * 30) + (0 * 94) + (2 * 90) = 98 + 91 + 120 + 0 + 180 = 489.\n\nSince it is round 1, if I accept, my discounted value will be 489 * (0.9^(1-1)) = 489 * 1 = 489.\nMy outside offer is 144. So, accepting the current offer is better than walking away right now.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, knowing Player 1 will also be trying to maximize theirs. It's round 1, so there are two more rounds to negotiate.\n\nIf I reject, I will make a counteroffer that offers player 1 at least their valuation of current offer.\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me:\nitem 1: 1 out of 3 units\nitem 2: 1 out of 4 units\nitem 3: 4 out of 4 units\nitem 4: 0 out of 5 units\nitem 5: 2 out of 4 units\n\nThis means that I would be giving player 1:\nitem 1: 2 units\nitem 2: 3 units\nitem 3: 0 units\nitem 4: 5 units\nitem 5: 2 units\n\nNow I can construct a counteroffer that will achieve a higher value than the current offer without being rejected. I will suggest offering player 1 slightly more value than they are currently receiving and see if they will accept. The current deal gives me 489. Let us try and formulate a new offer where I get at least 500.\n\nI need to decide how to split the items to achieve this. I value item 1, 2, 4 and 5 highly, but player 1 is already taking most of items 1 and 2. Item 3 is the one I value the least. I want to make sure the value of my offer is greater than 489, while not being too greedy that Player 1 would walk away.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1].

Given that my outside offer value is 132, I want to maximize the value of the items I retain, but I also need to propose something that the other player might consider reasonable, given their own values.\n\nLet's create a reasonable counteroffer that retains high-value items for me:\n\n- Item 1: Give 0 units to Player 2 (retaining all 2 units for myself, value: 108)\n- Item 2: Give 3 units to Player 2 (retaining 1 unit for myself, value: 5)\n- Item 3: Give 1 unit to Player 2 (retaining 3 units for myself, value: 225)\n- Item 4: Give 1 unit to Player 2 (retaining 1 unit for myself, value: 16)\n- Item 5: Give 0 units to Player 2 (retaining all 1 unit for myself, value: 33)\n\nNow, let\u2019s calculate my total value from this offer:\n\n- Retained value from my side: 108 (Item 1) + 5 (Item 2) + 225 (Item 3) + 16 (Item 4) + 33 (Item 5) = 387\n\n387 is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 132, which is sufficient, assuming Player 2 finds it acceptable.\n\nHere's my counteroffer to Player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

It's difficult to know their values, but I need to make a reasonable estimate of their minimum acceptable value.\n\nIf I counteroffer now, the round 2 value will be multiplied by 0.9. In round 3 by 0.81. It seems too risky to go to round 3 with the game ending if I give a counteroffer.\n\nMy goal is to get as close to my total value of all items (791) as possible.\n\nTo get at least the value of my outside option (141), I need to receive at least those values.\n\nI need to decide if I can formulate a counteroffer that gives me a higher discounted value than my outside offer. Let's consider two potential scenarios to cover my outside offer:\n\nScenario 1: Giving them my least valuable items and keeping the best.\nScenario 2: Trying to get more of the most valuable item I have.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario for making a counteroffer and them accepting it. To make a reasonable guess, let's consider the values of item 1 and item 2, which are the highest.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 280, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 141. Therefore, accepting is the optimal action.\nWith the discount factor, a counteroffer only makes sense if it gives me a *significantly* better outcome to offset the discount. I don't have enough information to construct a counteroffer that is guaranteed to be accepted and provide such a significantly better outcome, given I do not know the value of the items to the other player.\nIt is safer to just accept the current offer which is more than twice the outside offer value.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

So the present value of accepting this offer is 439.\n\nMy outside offer is 630.\n\nSince 439 < 630, accepting the offer is worse than walking away. I need to make a counteroffer that gives me at least 630, considering the discount factor in future rounds. Since it's round 1, the discount factor is 1.\n\nLet's think about a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value. To do this, I want to keep as much of item 1 as possible. I have to give Player 1 *something*. Let's try giving Player 1 the maximum of item 2, 3, 4 and 5.\n\nI give Player 1: [0, 3, 3, 6, 3].\nThis leaves me with: [4, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nMy value is then 4 * 100 = 400.\n\nSince this is much less than my outside offer, I should walk away or make a very aggressive counteroffer. Let's try to give Player 1 very little of item 1, which is the most valuable for me, and offer almost all other items.\n\nI could counteroffer: [4, 0, 0, 0, 0].

My private values are [91, 61, 62, 87, 51] for each item. My outside offer is 1047.

However, it's round 1, so there's still room for negotiation. Let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to figure out what a good counteroffer would be. My goal is to get an offer that's worth more than 1047 * 0.9 = 942.3 in the next round.\n\nTo construct a counteroffer, I need to decide how many units of each item to offer Player 1. Since I want to maximize my own value, I should try to keep the items I value most (items 1 and 4) and offer Player 1 more of the items I value less (items 2, 3, and 5). Also, I need to ensure that Player 1 gets at least their outside offer value in the end, discounted appropriately. Let's make a generous counteroffer, giving them slightly more of what they offered me.\nThe total units are: item1:3, item2:6, item3:6, item4:5, item5:3\nCurrent offer to me is: item1:0, item2:4, item3:5, item4:1, item5:1\nSo, Player 1 currently has: item1:3, item2:2, item3:1, item4:4, item5:2\n\nI will make an offer where I give them more of item 2, some more of item 3, and less of Item 4\n\nHere's a possible counteroffer to Player 1: [1, 5, 4, 3, 2]\nThis would leave me with: item1:2, item2:1, item3:2, item4:2, item5:1\nMy value for this would be: (2 * 91) + (1 * 61) + (2 * 62) + (2 * 87) + (1 * 51) = 182 + 61 + 124 + 174 + 51 = 592\n\nSince this is low, lets try an offer where I give the player 1: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0]. This would leave me with: item1:3, item2:1, item3:1, item4:5, item5:3\nMy value is (3 * 91) + (1 * 61) + (1 * 62) + (5 * 87) + (3 * 51) = 273 + 61 + 62 + 435 + 153 = 984. So discounted in next round my minimal threshold is 942.3. If I give this offer I am hoping that the other player will offer me a little bit of an extra increase in round 2.\nAlso, if it is round 3 and they make a counteroffer it is the same as walking.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 5, 0, 0]}\n",

Since 243 < 361, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's think about a potential counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 enough to make them accept, while still getting a better deal than my outside option.\nI have:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 6 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nto divide.\n\nI want to maximize my own gain. I highly value item 3 (97) and item 4 (75). I don't value items 1, 2, and 5 as much.\n\nHere's a possible counteroffer strategy. Let's try to get most of items 3 and 4, and give away more of items 1, 2 and 5 to Player 1.\n\nIf I give Player 1: [1, 3, 1, 2, 2], then I keep [1, 3, 2, 2, 1]. My value would be (1 * 5) + (3 * 18) + (2 * 97) + (2 * 75) + (1 * 12) = 5 + 54 + 194 + 150 + 12 = 415. This is much better than my outside option of 361.\n\nLet's try a different approach: I'll aim for a split that gives me at least my outside offer value, factoring in the discount rate in future rounds.\nSince this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So, I need to get 361.\n\nI will start with a counteroffer where I keep most of items 3 and 4 and offer the rest to Player 1: [1, 4, 0, 0, 2].\nIn this case, I will have [1, 2, 3, 4, 1], and its value will be: (1 * 5) + (2 * 18) + (3 * 97) + (4 * 75) + (1 * 12) = 5 + 36 + 291 + 300 + 12 = 644.\nThis is much better than my outside option of 361.\n\nLet me analyze the value for Player 1. I am giving the following to Player 1: [1, 4, 0, 0, 2]. I don't know their values. It is a risky counteroffer.\n\nGiven that my outside option is significant (361), I want to make a counteroffer that secures me a good deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is slightly more generous than the initial offer but still heavily favoring me based on my high valuation of items 3 and 4.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 4, 0, 1, 2]\n\nThis leaves me with: [1, 2, 3, 3, 1]\nMy value: (1 * 5) + (2 * 18) + (3 * 97) + (3 * 75) + (1 * 12) = 5 + 36 + 291 + 225 + 12 = 569\nThis is better than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Let's make the offer:\n\n- Offer [0, 2, 6, 0, 2] to Player 2, which means I propose:\n  - Keeping all of Item 1 and 4\n  - Offering 2 units of Item 2\n  - Offering 6 units of Item 3\n  - Keeping all of Item 4\n  - Offering 2 units of Item 5\n\nCalculating my value if they accept my offer:\n- My items: 2 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 7 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5 \n- Value = (2 * 95) + (2 * 78) + (7 * 61) + (1 * 75)\n- Value = 190 + 156 + 427 + 75 = 848\n\nThis value is advantageous for me (higher than my outside option) and potentially competitive for Player 2 based on variety.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 6, 0, 2]}",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 2, and Player 1 has offered me [0, 2, 6, 0, 2] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My values for these items are 80, 46, 38, 86, and 61. My outside offer is 1302, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(0 * 80) + (2 * 46) + (6 * 38) + (0 * 86) + (2 * 61) = 0 + 92 + 228 + 0 + 122 = 442\n\nSince this is round 1, and there are 3 rounds, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. Thus, the present value of the current offer is 442 * 1 = 442.  This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1302.\n\nTherefore, I should consider making a counteroffer. To determine a suitable counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might accept, and how close I can get to my ideal outcome while still being better than walking away.\n\nLet's think about my ideal scenario. If I got all the items, my value would be 2*80 + 4*46 + 6*38 + 7*86 + 3*61 = 160 + 184 + 228 + 602 + 183 = 1357. I want to get as close to this as possible while also securing a deal.\n\nSince the current offer is very low (442), I'll start with a relatively aggressive counteroffer. To begin, it seems Player 1 is undervaluing item 4 (they offered me 0 units despite there being 7 in total) while devaluing item 2. Let's try to keep item 4 while conceding some of other items. I need to offer Player 1 enough to make them consider this seriously. If Player 1 walks away, I get 1302.\n\nI need to give Player 1 some items. Here's a potential counteroffer: offer Player 1 [2, 2, 0, 7, 1]. This would mean I get [0, 2, 6, 0, 2] . Let's reiterate the value of the current offer, where the player 1 offer is [0, 2, 6, 0, 2]: (0 * 80) + (2 * 46) + (6 * 38) + (0 * 86) + (2 * 61) = 0 + 92 + 228 + 0 + 122 = 442.\nI can then determine the valuation of this offer, which is [0,2,6,0,2], if accepted. In this case, my best action is to create an offer that maximizes my valuation * the discount factor, while being greater than my reservation value.\n\nThe current offer is substantially below my outside offer, therefore I will propose an alternative offer. I should make it a better deal for me, but still leaving Player 1 with enough to consider it. I'll give Player 1 most of Item 1 and Item 4, and some of the other items, and see how that works.\nCounteroffer: [1, 2, 0, 6, 1]\n\nThis leaves me with: [1, 2, 6, 1, 2].\nMy value: 1*80 + 2*46 + 6*38 + 1*86 + 2*61 = 80 + 92 + 228 + 86 + 122 = 608\n\nThis valuation is better than the initial offer of 442, but still far below my outside offer of 1302.\n\nI will then propose a counteroffer of [1, 1, 0, 4, 1]. This means that I receive [1, 3, 6, 3, 2].\n\nMy valuation of the new offer is 1*80 + 3*46 + 6*38 + 3*86 + 2*61 = 80 + 138 + 228 + 258 + 122 = 826\n\nMy outside offer is 1302. I am still far below my outside offer. I will make a counteroffer to increase my valuation.\n\nLet's try giving Player 1 a minimal amount: [2, 4, 6, 7, 3]. This gives me nothing and Player 1 everything. So I need to reduce these values.\nI will offer [1, 2, 3, 3, 1]. This is a counteroffer.\nThis means I receive [1, 2, 3, 4, 2].\n\nMy valuation is 1*80 + 2*46 + 3*38 + 4*86 + 2*61 = 80 + 92 + 114 + 344 + 122 = 752\n\nThis offer means I receive 752 now. If I were to walk away, I would get 1302. So it is better to walk away.\nHowever, let us account for the discount rate.\n\nIf I counteroffer with [1, 2, 3, 3, 1], my valuation * the discount factor is 752 * 0.9 = 676.8\n\nSince this is round 1, and my discounted outside offer would be 1302 * 0.9^2 = 1054.62.\nThus, it is still better for me to walk away.\nSince I have one more round, I will propose a counteroffer that is better for me.\n\nLet's try [0, 1, 2, 2, 1].\nI receive: [2, 3, 4, 5, 2]\n\nMy valuation is 2*80 + 3*46 + 4*38 + 5*86 + 2*61 = 160 + 138 + 152 + 430 + 122 = 1002\n\nThe discounted value is 1002 * 0.9^0 = 1002\n\nI still prefer to walk away, as my outside offer value * the discount factor is 1302 * 0.9^2 = 1054.62.\n\nHowever, the negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds. Since the values are discounted, and it's round 1, I should give the other player more items to accept the valuation, because in subsequent rounds I can always choose to walk away.\n\nOffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nMy valuation is 1357\n\nCounteroffer: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This provides me a value of 0.\n   - My outside offer is valued at 801.\n\n2. **Potential Outcomes and My Values:**\n   - Total items are: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - My values per unit for these items are 95, 78, 5, 61, and 75 respectively.\n   - The total value if I receive all the items would be:\n     - Item 1: 2 * 95 = 190\n     - Item 2: 4 * 78 = 312\n     - Item 3: 6 * 5 = 30\n     - Item 4: 7 * 61 = 427\n     - Item 5: 3 * 75 = 225\n     - Total value = 190 + 312 + 30 + 427 + 225 = 1184\n\n3. **Comparison with My Outside Offer:**\n   - My outside offer is 801, which is substantial compared to any partial gain with a deal.\n   - Without significant portions of high-value items (primarily items 1, 2, 4, and 5), the value I would get from any deal is unlikely to exceed my outside offer after discounting.\n\n4. **Discount Factor:**\n   - Given that we are in round 2, any deal would be discounted by a factor of 0.9. This means that a proposal must offer an undiscounted value significantly higher than this to outweigh my outside offer.\n\n5. **Strategic Action:**\n   - Since Player 2 offered nothing, it indicates they might value their outside offer highly too, or they may see an advantage in renegotiation.\n   - My initial offer [0, 2, 6, 0, 2] was rejected by Player 2, which means a more favorable offer to me is unlikely unless an adjustment is made.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, accepting the current offer provides no benefit, and the WALK option guarantees 801. Therefore, a strategic COUNTEROFFER might entice an agreement better than walking away.\n\n**Counteroffer Strategy:**\n- Offer Player 2 a smaller share of high-value items while retaining significant value for myself:\n  - Item 1: Retain 1 for myself (offer 1)\n  - Item 2: Offer 2 (retain 2 for myself)\n  - Item 3: Offer all 6 to Player 2\n  - Item 4: Retain 5 for myself (offer 2)\n  - Item 5: Offer 1 (retain 2 for myself)\n\nThis proposal maximizes my gain while considering the likelihood of Player 2's acceptance.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:**\nCounteroffer to Player 2 with the items [1, 2, 6, 2, 1].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 6, 2, 1]}",

My values for each item are 80, 46, 38, 86, 61. My outside offer is 1302. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 80) + (2 * 46) + (6 * 38) + (2 * 86) + (1 * 61) = 80 + 92 + 228 + 172 + 61 = 633\n\nNow, I need to consider the potential value of accepting this offer versus walking away. If I accept, my value is 633 * 0.9^(2-1) = 633 * 0.9 = 569.7. If I walk away, my value is 1302.  Therefore, walking away is the better option *right now*.\n\nHowever, I'm in round 2. If I walk away, I get 1302. If I counteroffer, Player 1 can either accept, walk or counteroffer in round 3. So, there is a possibility that I can get better value with a counteroffer.\n\nTo decide on a counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might value. I don't know Player 1's values, so I need to think about what offer would be better than their outside option, given they are trying to maximize their profits.\n\nLet's calculate my total value for all items:\n(2 * 80) + (4 * 46) + (6 * 38) + (7 * 86) + (3 * 61) = 160 + 184 + 228 + 602 + 183 = 1357\nPlayer 1 currently has offered [1, 2, 6, 2, 1] to me. That means I would give to Player 1 [1, 2, 0, 5, 2]. This can be my counter offer to Player 1. The value I keep is 1 * 80 + 2*46 + 6*38 + 2*86 + 1*61= 633, as before. The value that player one has to have is 1357 - 633 = 724 * discount_rate.\n\nWhat if I offer player 1 something that is of little value to me, but great potential to Player 1. I would have to give almost everything away and it might still be less than 1302. So, let us try to offer player 1 something better than 633. Let me start by getting them to think I am valuing their values, so my offer will be lower than their value so that it does not look as bad.\nLet me give a counteroffer of [1, 2, 0, 5, 2]. Then, I am getting value of (1*80)+(2*46)+(6*38)+(2*86)+(1*61) = 80 + 92 + 228 + 172 + 61 = 633, with discount factor of 0.9 = 569.7.\nIf the counteroffer is accepted my value is still below the outside option of 1302.\nWhat if I were to give player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], giving myself [2, 4, 6, 7, 3].\nThis means my offer would be, 2 * 80 + 4 * 46 + 6 * 38 + 7 * 86 + 3 * 61 = 160 + 184 + 228 + 602 + 183 = 1357.\n1357 * .9 = 1221.3, which is less than my outside offer of 1302.\nSo walking away would still be a better deal.\nNow if I give player 1 [2, 4, 6, 7, 3] I get nothing.
