Let's try offering Player 1 all of item 3 and item 4 and see if this is better than walking away with my outside option.\n\nIf I give Player 1 all units of item 3 and item 4, that means I offer [0, 0, 4, 7, 0] to Player 1. This leaves me with:\n* 2 units of item 1: 2 * 23 = 46\n* 4 units of item 2: 4 * 48 = 192\n* 0 units of item 3: 0 * 1 = 0\n* 0 units of item 4: 0 * 2 = 0\n* 4 units of item 5: 4 * 64 = 256\nTotal value to me: 46 + 192 + 0 + 0 + 256 = 494.\n\nNow, we need to discount this value by 0.9: 494 * 0.9 = 444.6\n\nSince 444.6 > 410, it makes sense to make the counteroffer: [0, 0, 4, 7, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 7, 0]}\n```",

If we start by considering giving a small amount to Player 2 to test their preferences while ensuring my outcome is sufficiently above my outside offer, this could be an initial strategy. I'll aim for a proposal that retains a significant portion of valuable items to ensure the total value to me is higher than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider keeping the entirety of item 5 since it's the most valuable per unit to me, and provide Player 2 with a portion of the other items as a starting offer. Here's one possible initial distribution of the offer for Player 2:\n\n- Offer: [1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5]\n\nCalculating my remaining value:\n\n- Remaining item 1: 2 units \u00d7 37 = 74\n- Remaining item 2: 3 units \u00d7 29 = 87\n- Remaining item 3: 3 units \u00d7 92 = 276\n- Remaining item 4: 3 units \u00d7 49 = 147\n- Remaining item 5: 2 units \u00d7 100 = 200\n\nTotal value of remaining items = 74 + 87 + 276 + 147 + 200 = 784\n\nSince 784 > 211, this proposal holds substantial value compared to my outside offer.

So I should either walk or make a counteroffer.\n\nNow, let's think about a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I should try to get as much of the items I value highly (item 3 and item 4) as possible. Player 1 offered relatively little, which means I can likely get more if I counteroffer. I need to give something back, though.\nI have a total of 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nThe current offer gives me [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]. This means Player 1 gets [2, 3, 3, 3, 2].\n\nLet's try to construct an offer that is better for me than my outside offer. My outside offer is 693, and the discount factor is 0.9.\nI want to make an offer such that 0.9*value(my offer) > 693.\nThis would be when value(my offer) > 693/0.9 = 770.\nThe total value available in the items is 1156. I need at least value 770 for the deal to be profitable. So I can give away at most 1156 - 770 = 386.\n\nI will give Player 1 a little bit more of items 1, 2, and 5 to get a larger share of items 3 and 4. How about offering Player 1 [2, 3, 1, 1, 1]. Then I would get:\nItem 1: 1 * 50 = 50\nItem 2: 1 * 39 = 39\nItem 3: 4 * 78 = 312\nItem 4: 4 * 74 = 296\nItem 5: 1 * 45 = 45\nTotal value: 50 + 39 + 312 + 296 + 45 = 742\nDiscounted value: 742*0.9 = 667.8.\nThis counteroffer yields 742, which when discounted gives me a value of 667.8. This is worse than walking away.\nWhat about the following counteroffer? Player 1 gets [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I have all items.\nMy value is 1156. After discounting, it becomes 0.9*1156 = 1040.4 > 693.\nTherefore, I will offer Player 1 nothing and keep all the items for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This step involves ensuring my retained allocation results in a value exceeding my outside offer.\n\nLet's explore potential offers ensuring I'm maximizing my potential value:\n\n1. Offer 2 units of Item 1: Keeping 2 units (value = 2 \u00d7 26 = 52)\n2. Offer 4 units of Item 2: Keeping 2 units (value = 2 \u00d7 95 = 190)\n3. Offer 1 unit of Item 3: Keeping 2 units (value = 2 \u00d7 52 = 104)\n4. Offer 3 units of Item 4: Keeping 1 unit (value = 1 \u00d7 48 = 48)\n5. Offer 4 units of Item 5: Keeping 1 unit (value = 1 \u00d7 39 = 39)\n\nMy value calculated from keeping is:  \n52 + 190 + 104 + 48 + 39 = 433\n\nPost discount (as it's in round 1, no discount yet): 433\n\nConsidering this strategy, I realize my failure to cross 733 in retained value. Thus, I need to adjust by offering fewer items or retaining more key ones:\n\n#### Revised Proposal:\n1. Offer 1 unit of Item 1: Keeping 3 units (value = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78)\n2. Offer 3 units of Item 2: Keeping 3 units (value = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285)\n3. Offer 0 units of Item 3: Keeping 3 units (value = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156)\n4. Offer 2 units of Item 4: Keeping 2 units (value = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96)\n5. Offer 3 units of Item 5: Keeping 2 units (value = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78)\n\nRe-calculated retained value:  \n78 + 285 + 156 + 96 + 78 = 693\n\nUpon reevaluation, despite discount impacts in later rounds, the current strategic positioning is still underwhelming. Another refined allocation could involve slight balancing within my higher value items like Item 2:\n\nFinal Counteroffer:\n1. Offer 1 unit of Item 1\n2. Offer 4 units of Item 2\n3. Offer 0 units of Item 3\n4. Offer 2 units of Item 4\n5. Offer 2 units of Item 5\n\nRetained calculation rechecks aiming to safely bypass 733, achieving closer negotiation targets.\n\nThus, my counteroffer to Player 2 is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

Since this is round 1, I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal. Walking away now guarantees me 833, but a well-constructed counteroffer could yield a higher value, especially considering the discount factor will reduce future gains.\n\nTo make an informed counteroffer, I need to consider the total number of items available and my valuation of them:\n* Item 1: 4 units, value 5 each\n* Item 2: 6 units, value 21 each\n* Item 3: 3 units, value 48 each\n* Item 4: 4 units, value 45 each\n* Item 5: 5 units, value 97 each\n\nMy total possible value is (4 * 5) + (6 * 21) + (3 * 48) + (4 * 45) + (5 * 97) = 20 + 126 + 144 + 180 + 485 = 955\n\nI will construct a counteroffer that aims to get me a value close to my outside offer, while also giving Player 1 enough to make it worthwhile for them to accept. Let's aim for a split where I get slightly more than my outside offer, and they get the remainder. It's difficult to know Player 1's preferences without any information, so I will just make a reasonable offer.\n\nI'll offer Player 1:\n* Item 1: 3 units\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 1 unit\n* Item 4: 1 unit\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n* Item 1: 1 unit\n* Item 2: 4 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 3 units\n* Item 5: 3 units\n\nThe value of this for me is: (1 * 5) + (4 * 21) + (2 * 48) + (3 * 45) + (3 * 97) = 5 + 84 + 96 + 135 + 291 = 611\n\nThe value to Player 1 of my offer is: (3 * Player 1's value of item 1) + (2 * Player 1's value of item 2) + (1 * Player 1's value of item 3) + (1 * Player 1's value of item 4) + (2 * Player 1's value of item 5)\n\nThis offer gives me 611. If I accept a deal in the next round I get 0.9 * deal. Therefore, my deal has to be worth more than 833/0.9 = 925.5 to be worth accepting a deal next round. The current deal is worth 373, much less than my walkaway.\n\nLet's try to get close to my walkaway in this offer, but leave the other player with some value.\nGive the other player: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0\n\nI get: 4*5 + 5*21 + 3*48 + 4*45 + 5*97 = 20 + 105 + 144 + 180 + 485 = 934\n\nOk this is good I will offer the other player: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

The offer is [2, 2, 0, 2, 2], meaning I receive:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 28 = 56\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 * 34 = 68\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 * 33 = 0\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 88 = 176\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 87 = 174\nTotal value of current offer: 56 + 68 + 0 + 176 + 174 = 474\n\nMy outside offer is 1186. Since 474 < 1186, accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n\nNow, I need to consider whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. If I walk away, I get 1186. If I make a counteroffer, the other player might accept, reject and make a counteroffer, or walk away. The discount factor gamma = 0.9 will affect the values in future rounds.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I try to maximize my value. I have:\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 6 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nI need to decide how many units of each item to give to Player 1.  My values are 28, 34, 33, 88, 87. Player 1's values are unknown, but they likely want more of items 4 and 5, as those have the highest potential value for either of us.\n\nGiven the limited rounds and the discount factor, I want to aim for a deal that is better than my outside offer now. A good strategy is to offer player 1 an amount that makes them better off than their unknown outside offer.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a reasonable value while maximizing my own. A possible counteroffer is to give Player 1:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 28 = 56\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 * 34 = 68\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 33 = 33\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 * 88 = 264\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 87 = 174\nTotal value of this counteroffer to me: 56 + 68 + 33 + 264 + 174 = 595.\n\nSince 595 < 1186, this counteroffer is not immediately better than walking away. Let's revise it and be more aggressive. I want to reach a total value greater than 1186. To do this, I will offer the other player items they might value more than I do. I value items 4 and 5 the most.\n\nLet's try giving player 1:\n- 1 units of item 1\n- 1 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 units of item 4\n- 1 units of item 5\n\nThat leaves me with:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4*28 = 112\n- 3 units of item 2: 3*34 = 102\n- 2 units of item 3: 2*33 = 66\n- 5 units of item 4: 5*88 = 440\n- 3 units of item 5: 3*87 = 261\nTotal value to me = 112 + 102 + 66 + 440 + 261 = 981\n\nStill less than 1186. I need to aim higher.\n\nLet me offer this counteroffer:\n- 0 unit of item 1\n- 0 unit of item 2\n- 0 unit of item 3\n- 2 unit of item 4\n- 0 unit of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 5 unit of item 1: 5*28 = 140\n- 4 unit of item 2: 4*34 = 136\n- 2 unit of item 3: 2*33 = 66\n- 4 unit of item 4: 4*88 = 352\n- 4 unit of item 5: 4*87 = 348\n\nTotal value to me = 140 + 136 + 66 + 352 + 348 = 1042\n\nStill less than the outside option. However, it's possible Player 1 values the two units of item 4 a great deal more than I think. Let me make a counteroffer where I keep all of item 5, since it's my second best option.\n\nLet's offer this:\n- 0 unit of item 1\n- 0 unit of item 2\n- 0 unit of item 3\n- 5 unit of item 4\n- 0 unit of item 5\nThis means I keep\n- 5 unit of item 1: 5*28 = 140\n- 4 unit of item 2: 4*34 = 136\n- 2 unit of item 3: 2*33 = 66\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1*88 = 88\n- 4 unit of item 5: 4*87 = 348\n\nMy total: 140+136+66+88+348 = 778. Still not enough.\n\nSince it is Round 1, I can afford to make an offer that is more in my favor, and see if the other player is desperate enough to accept. I will only offer them the bare minimum and see if they accept.\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 0 unit of item 3\n- 0 unit of item 4\n- 0 unit of item 5\n\nLeaving me with:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 112\n- 3 units of item 2 = 102\n- 2 units of item 3 = 66\n- 6 units of item 4 = 528\n- 4 units of item 5 = 348\nTotal value = 1156\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer, so it's worth making this offer and seeing if the other player accepts.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Therefore, accepting this offer is not beneficial for me.\n\n### Consideration of Possible Counteroffer\nLet's now think about a counteroffer that maximizes value, or is potentially more palatable to Player 2, while keeping the value to me higher than my outside option.\n\nA potential reasonable distribution for maximizing my value (at least greater than 529) while giving something satisfactory to Player 2 could be:\n\nKeeping for myself:\n- 4 units of item 1 (value = 4 \u00d7 77 = 308)\n- 3 units of item 2 (value = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15)\n- 2 units of item 3 (value = 2 \u00d7 50 = 100)\n- 5 units of item 4 (value = 5 \u00d7 97 = 485)\n- 3 units of item 5 (value = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141)\n\nTotal value if I keep the above: 308 + 15 + 100 + 485 + 141 = 1049\n\nOffering to Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThe value of my counteroffer to me, considering what I keep, is 1049. When adjusted for the gamma factor for round 2, it gives me an effective value of \\( 1049 \\times 0.9^{1} = 944.1 \\), which is considerably higher than my outside offer of 529.\n\nThus, I will propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. My private values are 28, 34, 33, 88, and 87 for items 1 through 5, respectively. My outside offer is 1186. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the value of accepting the current offer:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 28 = 28\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 34 = 34\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 * 33 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 88 = 88\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 87 = 87\nTotal value of accepting the offer = 28 + 34 + 0 + 88 + 87 = 237\n\nSince it's round 2, the discounted value of accepting is 237 * 0.9^(2-1) = 237 * 0.9 = 213.3. This is much less than my outside offer of 1186, so accepting is not a good idea.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to decide how many units of each item to offer Player 1. I have the following total units available: 5 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n\nIn round 1, Player 1 offered me [2, 2, 0, 2, 2], and I countered with [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Player 1's current offer is [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. This suggests that Player 1 values items 4 and 5 more highly than I initially thought.\n\nLet's calculate the value to me if I offer Player 1 *all* of items 1, 2 and 3, and *some* of 4 and 5.  Let's consider offering [5, 4, 2, 3, 2] to Player 1. This would leave me with [0, 0, 0, 3, 2]. The value to me would be 3*88 + 2*87 = 264 + 174 = 438.  Discounted, that would be 438 * 0.9 = 394.2. Still worse than my outside offer.\n\nI'll try to create a counteroffer that is slightly better than my outside offer. Since the most valuable items to me are 4 and 5, I should try to keep as many of them as possible. Let's offer Player 1 [3, 3, 1, 3, 2]. This means I get to keep [2, 1, 1, 3, 2]. The value to me would be 2*28 + 1*34 + 1*33 + 3*88 + 2*87 = 56 + 34 + 33 + 264 + 174 = 561. Discounted, it would be 561 * 0.9 = 504.9, which is still far worse than the outside offer.\n\nIt's very likely I will have to walk. If I make a counteroffer, it is treated as a WALK in the last round. Since this is the last round, I will WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, accepting the current offer is not beneficial for me. \n\nNext, I will consider making a counteroffer that retains a higher value for me than my outside offer.\n\n5. **Propose a counteroffer with value above my outside offer:**\n   - Let's calculate a counteroffer where I keep higher value items.\n   - Possible counteroffer: [0, 2, 2, 3, 4] to Player 2, meaning I keep 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\n6. **Evaluate this counteroffer:**\n   - Value for me:\n     - 4 \u00d7 35 = 140 for item 1\n     - 4 \u00d7 79 = 316 for item 2\n     - 7 \u00d7 31 = 217 for item 3\n     - 2 \u00d7 23 = 46 for item 4\n     - 1 \u00d7 29 = 29 for item 5\n   - Total value = 140 + 316 + 217 + 46 + 29 = 748\n   - Present value in Round 2 = 748 \u00d7 0.9 = 673.2\n\nSince 673.2 is still below my outside option of 942, I will not propose this counteroffer since I risk losing value by doing so.

The most valuable items per my value ratings are:\n     1. Item 2\n     2. Item 3\n     3. Item 5\n   - To maximize value without giving away too much, I propose:\n\n   Counteroffer:\n   - Item 1: 3 to Player 2, keeping 2 for myself (value 24)\n   - Item 2: 0 to Player 2, keeping all 3 for myself (value 282)\n   - Item 3: 1 to Player 2, keeping 2 for myself (value 94)\n   - Item 4: 2 to Player 2, keeping 0 for myself (value 0)\n   - Item 5: 5 to Player 2, keeping 3 for myself (value 84)\n   - Total value for me if this offer is accepted: 24 + 282 + 94 + 0 + 84 = 484\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - This counteroffer provides me a substantial value of 484 which is significantly above my adjusted outside offer value of 22.22.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [3, 0, 1, 2, 5], meaning I get 3 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 25\n- Item 3: 50\n- Item 4: 5\n- Item 5: 98\n\nValue of the current offer:\n- Item 1: 3 * 1 = 3\n- Item 2: 0 * 25 = 0\n- Item 3: 1 * 50 = 50\n- Item 4: 2 * 5 = 10\n- Item 5: 5 * 98 = 490\nTotal value = 3 + 0 + 50 + 10 + 490 = 553\n\nSince this is round 2, we need to discount the value by gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nDiscounted value of the current offer = 553 * 0.9 = 497.7\n\nMy outside offer is 686. Since 497.7 < 686, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, and I know that Player 1 previously offered [5, 2, 2, 2, 4] in the first round. I countered with [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Now, in the second round, Player 1 offered [3, 0, 1, 2, 5].\n\nSince we are in the second round and I want to maximize my value, I should make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer when discounted. If I cannot find such a counteroffer, then I should walk away. Since there is only one round left after this, I would rather walk away than make a bad deal.\n\nLet's think about how to construct a counteroffer. My value is heavily influenced by item 5, so I want to keep as much of that as possible. My second-best item is item 3.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1 everything except the item 5 and item 3.\nMy counteroffer would be [5, 3, 2, 2, 0]. That means I get [0, 0, 1, 0, 8].\nMy value would be 0 + 0 + 50 + 0 + 8*98 = 50 + 784 = 834\nDiscounted value = 834 * 0.9 = 750.6, which is greater than my outside offer of 686. This is potentially a good counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1 everything except item 5.\nMy counteroffer would be [5, 3, 3, 2, 0]. That means I get [0, 0, 0, 0, 8].\nMy value would be 8*98 = 784\nDiscounted value = 784 * 0.9 = 705.6, which is greater than my outside offer of 686. This is potentially a good counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1 2 item 5 as a compromise.\nMy counteroffer would be [5, 3, 3, 2, 2]. That means I get [0, 0, 0, 0, 6].\nMy value would be 6 * 98 = 588\nDiscounted value = 588 * 0.9 = 529.2, which is less than my outside offer of 686. This is not a good counteroffer.\n\nIt looks like focusing on retaining item 5 is crucial. I believe [5, 3, 3, 2, 0] is the best offer to make.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 3, 3, 2, 0]}\n```",

I should keep the most valuable items for myself or enough to at least come close to my outside offer. Let's try an initial offer where I maximize my current value:\n\n**Propose a Counteroffer:**\n\n- Keep the most valuable items primarily for myself.\n- Offer fewer items initially to test the waters and understand Player 2's threshold.\n\nExample counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 2: [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\nThis means:\n- Keeping 3 units of item 1 for myself: 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n- Keeping 3 units of item 2 for myself: 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n- Keeping 1 unit of item 3 for myself: 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- Keeping 3 units of item 4 for myself: 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- Keeping 3 units of item 5 for myself: 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n\nTotal value for me = 219 + 99 + 35 + 174 + 207 = 734\n\nThis offer will need adjusting, as 734 is below 1047. To attempt to reach my threshold, I'll reduce the offer to Player 2 even more:\n\nReassess:\n- Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\nSelf valuation on this distribution:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 69 = 276\n\nTotal value now = 219 + 132 + 70 + 174 + 276 = 871, which is still below my outside offer value.\n\nLet's finalize the action by trying to balance between an aggressive and feasible counteroffer while learning about Player 2's constraints.\n\nFinal Offer:\n- Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\nMy projected self-value:\n- Keeping 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n- Keeping 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n- Keeping 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n- Keeping 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n- Keeping 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n\nRe-calculated total value = 219 + 132 + 70 + 232 + 207 = 860\n\nStill below desired value; however, strategy involves using future acceptance possibility if Player 2 reacts. If not accepted, adjust further next round by scaling back on less valuable items.\n\nGiven alternatives, I'll move with this initial counteroffer for dynamic strategic positioning:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Since 377 < 1059, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, taking into account Player 1's likely rationality and the discount factor in future rounds. Since it's round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nThe total number of items are:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 5\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 5\n- Item 5: 5\n\nThe current offer to me is [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]. This means Player 1 currently has [3, 4, 2, 4, 3].\n\nTo determine a reasonable counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might find acceptable. Without knowing their values, it's difficult to predict perfectly. However, I can aim for a split that gives me significantly more than my outside offer, while still giving Player 1 a reasonable share.\n\nLet's start by offering Player 1 a relatively smaller amount of the items I value highly, and a larger amount of the items I value less. For instance, I could try offering: [2, 3, 1, 3, 3]\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n- Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2\n- Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n- Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2\n- Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2\n\nThe value of this to me would be:\n(2 * 74) + (2 * 78) + (1 * 29) + (2 * 93) + (2 * 66) = 148 + 156 + 29 + 186 + 132 = 651\n\nSince 651 < 1059, this counteroffer is not ideal.\n\nLet me instead try an offer where I keep more of the items I value highly. Let's try offering Player 1: [1, 2, 1, 2, 2].\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n- Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3\n- Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n- Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3\n- Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nMy value would be:\n(3 * 74) + (3 * 78) + (1 * 29) + (3 * 93) + (3 * 66) = 222 + 234 + 29 + 279 + 198 = 962\nThis is still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 1, 0, 1, 1].\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 4\nMy value:\n(4 * 74) + (4 * 78) + (2 * 29) + (4 * 93) + (4 * 66) = 296 + 312 + 58 + 372 + 264 = 1302.

Given the discount factor for the second round (gamma = 0.9):\n\n- Adjusted value after applying the discount: 1002 \u00d7 0.9 = 901.8\n\n### Comparison Against Outside Offer\n- The outside offer is valued at 1047.\n- The discounted value of the current offer (901.8) is less than my outside offer (1047).\n\nSince the adjusted value of accepting the current offer is less than my outside offer, I have a strong incentive not to accept the current offer.\n\n### Consider a Counteroffer\nI aim to have a deal with a total value above 1047 after applying the discount factor. A reasonable strategy could be to slightly revise the items offered to increase my total value.\n\nI previously offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 2] and received [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]. Let's aim to keep more valuable items.\n\n- Counteroffer: [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n  - Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3 units for me (Expected value: 3 \u00d7 73 = 219)\n  - Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3 units for me (Expected value: 3 \u00d7 33 = 99)\n  - Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 units for me (Expected value: 2 \u00d7 35 = 70)\n  - Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4 units for me (Expected value: 4 \u00d7 58 = 232)\n  - Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units for me (Expected value: 3 \u00d7 69 = 207)\n  - Total value = 219 + 99 + 70 + 232 + 207 = 827\n\nThis counteroffer might appear to give me a bit less total value compared to my previous standing. However, adjusting items of lesser value to slightly improve the outcome may leave open room for another future counteroffer. Let me reassess.\n\nLet's issue the counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 1, 2] again, which provides an acceptable value compared to my outside option, while hoping player 2 values some of these items differently.\n\nCalculations revised as per the original counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n- Item 2: 4 units \u2192 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n- Item 3: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n- Item 4: 4 units \u2192 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n- Item 5: 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n- Total new counter = 219 + 132 + 70 + 232 + 207 = 860\n- Adjusted value: 860 \u00d7 0.9 = 774\n\nRevising my approach, realize I aim must over 1047, propose a counter [2, 2, 0, 2, 3].\n\nRe-calculation:\n- Item 1: 2 for me, value: 146\n- Item 2: 3 for me, value: 99\n- Item 3: 2 for me, value: 70\n- Item 4: 3 for me, value: 174\n- Item 5: 2 for me, value: 138\n- Total new: 146 + 99 + 70 + 174 + 138 = 627\n\nFinal calculation may appear lower than expected; however see negotiation flows.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are:\n- Item 1: 26\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 57\n- Item 4: 50\n- Item 5: 8\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 26) + (1 * 3) + (0 * 57) + (0 * 50) + (0 * 8) = 26 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 29\n\nSince my outside offer is 413, and the current offer is only worth 29, I should definitely not accept the current offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to determine a counteroffer that would be better than walking away and receiving my outside offer of 413.  Since Player 1 has already offered a very small amount, I need to offer them a small amount in return to increase my own value, otherwise they would walk away. The total number of available items are 7 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\nI have to offer a deal which is better than my outside offer of 413. The total possible value I can get from all the items is (7 * 26) + (6 * 3) + (3 * 57) + (2 * 50) + (1 * 8) = 182 + 18 + 171 + 100 + 8 = 479.\nSince Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], it means I have [6, 5, 3, 2, 1]. Value is 6*26 + 5*3 + 3*57 + 2*50 + 1*8 = 156 + 15 + 171 + 100 + 8 = 450. This is greater than 413. It is possible for both of us to gain.\n\nI think I will offer player 1 the following: I will give them 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and the one available unit of item 5.\nThe counteroffer I'm making is [7, 6, 2, 1, 1] .\n\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 0 units, value 0\n- Item 2: 0 units, value 0\n- Item 3: 1 unit, value 57\n- Item 4: 1 unit, value 50\n- Item 5: 0 unit, value 0\nMy value is now only 107. This is much less than my outside option of 413, and this shows there is a high chance of me walking away later.\n\nI think I will offer player 1 more items. I will give them [2, 2, 1, 1, 0].\nMy value would be:\n(7-2) * 26 + (6-2) * 3 + (3-1) * 57 + (2-1) * 50 + (1-0) * 8 = 5 * 26 + 4 * 3 + 2 * 57 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 8 = 130 + 12 + 114 + 50 + 8 = 314. This is also less than 413.\n\nIt seems I need to give them even less. What if I offer them nothing? [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nMy value is 479, this is greater than 413.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

I currently have:\n* Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4\n* Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2\n* Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3\n* Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n* Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2\nMy Counter offer would be for Player 1 to receive: 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, which would leave me with 3, 1, 3, 2, 1.\n\nValue of the current counter offer to me\n* Item 1: 4 * 100 = 400\n* Item 2: 1 * 26 = 26\n* Item 3: 3 * 43 = 129\n* Item 4: 2 * 47 = 94\n* Item 5: 1 * 27 = 27\nTotal Value = 676\n\nGiven that the current offer of 333 is greater than my outside offer of 43, and I can likely get an even better deal through negotiation, I should make a counteroffer. Let's try to push for a better deal, since it's still early in the negotiation. I'll propose a counteroffer where I receive more of item 1 which I value the most.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 3, 2, 1]}\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I must offer Player 2 a division of the items that leaves me with an overall value greater than 905, considering the discount factor of 0.9 if this process goes into future rounds.\n\nHere's my analysis for Round 1:\n\n1. **Total Items Available**:\n   - Item 1: 3 units\n   - Item 2: 5 units\n   - Item 3: 4 units\n   - Item 4: 2 units\n   - Item 5: 5 units\n\n2. **My Value per Unit**:\n   - Item 1: 17\n   - Item 2: 79\n   - Item 3: 81\n   - Item 4: 72\n   - Item 5: 13\n\n3. **Current Offer on the Table**: None, as it's the initial round.\n\n4. **Calculating Total Value**:\n   My aim is to provide a counteroffer that keeps my total retained value above 905 if possible. \n\n5. **Example Calculation**:\n   Let's attempt to give Player 2 a low but reasonable number of items to see what's feasible. For example:\n   - Offer Player 2: [1 unit of each item]\n   - My units left: [2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 4 of item 5]\n\n   - Value calculation for me:\n     - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 17 = 34\n     - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 79 = 316\n     - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 81 = 243\n     - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 72 = 72\n     - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 13 = 52\n\n   - Total Value = 34 + 316 + 243 + 72 + 52 = 717\n\nThis value of 717 is below my outside offer value of 905. Therefore, this offer is not beneficial for me as it stands.\n\n6. **Strategy**: \n   - I should try to retain more valuable items instead or make a more strategic allocation if needed.\n   - Given this information and considering the high outside offer value (905), it's not beneficial to go into a deal unless I can get significantly more value than my outside offer.\n\nThus, any counteroffer I make must either significantly increase my retained value or involve a strategic play into subsequent rounds. Based on this situation and the need to meet a minimum value threshold (905), my logical step is to make a counteroffer where I retain a maximum value scheme. Let's attempt again with adjusted numbers:\n\nRe-attempt offer:\n- Offer Player 2: [1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5].\n- My units left: [2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 0 of item 5].\n\nValue calculation for me:\n- Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 17 = 34\n- Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 79 = 395\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 81 = 162\n- Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 72 = 144\n\nTotal Value = 34 + 395 + 162 + 144 = 735\n\nStill below my outside offer. There seems no immediate configuration beating an outside value of 905.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nGiven my outside offer is worth 905 and none of my initial configurations reach this value due to initial constraints, I will not proceed to risky counters. The logical choice is to WALK.\n\n**Action**:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

My goal is to propose something that maximizes my value above my outside offer of 136.\n\nA potential reasonable initial counteroffer could be:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 1 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n  - Keeping the rest for myself\n\nHere's the calculation for the value of the remaining units for me:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (5 - 4) = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n- 1 unit of item 2 (4 - 3) = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n- 2 units of item 3 (3 - 1) = 2 \u00d7 95 = 190\n- 1 unit of item 4 (2 - 1) = 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n- 1 unit of item 5 (5 - 4) = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n- Total value staying with me = 13 + 34 + 190 + 72 + 6 = 315\n\nSince the total value of this configuration to me is 315, which is considerably above my outside offer, and given that we are in the first round without discounts applied, this offer is beneficial for me.\n\nThus, I will proceed with this initial COUNTEROFFER to Player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 1, 1, 4]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 1, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 3, 1, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [4, 3, 1, 1, 4], meaning Player 1 is offering me 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\nLet's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* 4 units of item 1: 4 * 91 = 364\n* 3 units of item 2: 3 * 41 = 123\n* 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 30 = 30\n* 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 64 = 64\n* 4 units of item 5: 4 * 60 = 240\nTotal value of the offer: 364 + 123 + 30 + 64 + 240 = 821\n\nNow, let's compare this to my outside offer of 329.  The current offer (821) is significantly better than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting seems like a good idea.\n\nHowever, since this is round 1, there's a chance I can get an even better deal. I need to consider a counteroffer. The total amount of each item is: 5 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.  Therefore if I reject the current offer, I can give player one anything between 0 and the total amount.\n\nLet's consider what would happen if I accepted. My payoff would be 821 * 0.9^(1-1) = 821. If I walked away, my payoff would be 329 * 0.9^(1-1) = 329.\n\nBefore committing to accepting, let's see if we can find a counteroffer that is superior. To do this we must think about what values player 1 may have, so let us give a counteroffer that is slightly more aggressive and see where it gets us.\n\nHere is the list of item amounts I possess:\n* Item 1: 5 - 4 = 1\n* Item 2: 4 - 3 = 1\n* Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n* Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n* Item 5: 5 - 4 = 1\n\nLet's offer Player 1 something slightly worse for me than what they currently have, and see if they take the bait. Let's change one item to be in my favor a little more:\n\nConsider a counteroffer of [3, 2, 0, 0, 3]. This means I would receive:\n* Item 1: 5-3 = 2\n* Item 2: 4-2 = 2\n* Item 3: 3-0 = 3\n* Item 4: 2-0 = 2\n* Item 5: 5-3 = 2\n\nMy value from this: (2*91) + (2*41) + (3*30) + (2*64) + (2*60) = 182 + 82 + 90 + 128 + 120 = 602\nThis isn't better than 821, so that wouldn't work. So clearly that offer would not work.\n\nSince the current offer is significantly better than walking away, and I am not confident that I can create a better counteroffer and have it accepted, I will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 520. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 690 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 5, 2, 1, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on an action, I need to analyze the current offer and compare it to both my outside offer and the possibility of making a profitable counteroffer.\n\n**Values of the items and current offer:**\n- **Item 1:** Offered 1 unit, worth 22 per unit. Total value = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n- **Item 2:** Offered 2 units, worth 53 per unit. Total value = 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n- **Item 3:** Offered 1 unit, worth 59 per unit. Total value = 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n- **Item 4:** Offered 0 units, worth 91 per unit. Total value = 0 \u00d7 91 = 0\n- **Item 5:** Offered 1 unit, worth 5 per unit. Total value = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n\n**Total value of the offer to me:**  \n22 + 106 + 59 + 0 + 5 = 192\n\n**Considering the discount factor:**\nThis is round 2, so the values are adjusted by gamma \\((0.9)^{1}\\).  \nAdjusted value = 192 \u00d7 0.9 = 172.8\n\n**Outside offer value:**  \n520\n\nThe current offer's value of 172.8 is significantly lower than my outside offer of 520.\n\n**Considering a counteroffer:**\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that gives me at least an adjusted value more than 520. Let's find a possible division:\n\n- I could attempt to keep a higher value from the high-value items 2 and 4, which are critical given their high value to me (53 and 91, respectively).\n\nLet's propose this counteroffer:\n\n- Offer 1 of Item 1: I keep 2, worth 44. \n- Offer 2 of Item 2: I keep 4, worth 212.\n- Offer 1 of Item 3: I keep 2, worth 118.\n- Offer 0 of Item 4: I keep 2, worth 182.\n- Offer 3 of Item 5: I keep 2, worth 10.\n\n**My kept items' value without discount:**  \n44 + 212 + 118 + 182 + 10 = 566\n\nConsidering discount for round 2:  \nAdjusted value = 566 \u00d7 0.9 = 509.4\n\nThis adjusted value is slightly less than my outside offer. \n\nAfter attempting different calculations, it seems unlikely that a profitable counteroffer (adjusted value over 520) that can be made given current constraints and potential acceptance by Player 2, within the realistic boundaries of both private values and negotiation power.\n\nThus, considering the above calculations and reasoning, the prudent decision here is to reject the current offer and WALK away, opting for my outside offer which guarantees a value of 520.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

The adjusted value of the current offer (89.1) is far below my outside offer, making it unfavorable to accept the current offer.\n\n### Counteroffer Consideration\nTo justify a counteroffer, it must yield a greater value than my outside offer when adjusted for the discount factor. My goal is to retain as much of the high-value items (item 2 and item 4) as possible, while still proposing something reasonable.\n\nConsidering the inventory:\n- Total items available: [6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5]\n- I propose to let Player 2 have more of the less valuable items from my perspective, ensuring my value is above 267 when adjusted.\n\n#### Proposed Counteroffer to Player 2\nA reasonable counteroffer could be:\n- Offer Player 2: [3, 1, 0, 0, 2] \n  - I keep 3 units of item 1 (93 total value to me)\n  - I keep 3 units of item 2 (204 total value to me)\n  - I keep 1 unit of item 4 (52 total value to me)\n  - I keep 1 unit of item 5 (13 total value to me)\n  \nCalculating my total value:\n- From item 1: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- From item 2: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n- From item 4: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n- From item 5: 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n\nTotal value = 93 + 204 + 52 + 13 = 362\nAdjusted value = 362 \u00d7 0.9 = 325.8\n\n325.8 is greater than my outside offer value of 267.\n\n### Decision\nA counteroffer with the values described maximizes the value I receive beyond my outside offer and recognizes the discount factor. Here is the counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

Since 319.5 is less than 398, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 something that they will accept, but also gives me more than 398 * (1/0.9) = 442.22 in this round or it makes sense to walk.\nLet's aim for something that gives me at least a slight edge over my outside option, while still being realistic enough that player 1 might accept.\nRemember I have 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Player 1 is asking for [3, 1, 0, 0, 2]. I offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] in the previous round.\n\nI could try offering slightly less than my initial offer to Player 1 to indicate that I am willing to negotiate but not give much more, as the negotiation will soon end, with me possibly opting for my outside option.\nCounteroffer: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means I receive:\n* Item 1: 4 units = 4 * 1 = 4\n* Item 2: 3 units = 3 * 55 = 165\n* Item 3: 0 units = 0 * 88 = 0\n* Item 4: 1 unit = 1 * 95 = 95\n* Item 5: 3 units = 3 * 92 = 276\nTotal value = 4 + 165 + 0 + 95 + 276 = 540\n\nDiscounted value = 540 * 0.9 = 486\n\nSince 486 > 398, and the previous offer did not satisfy me, a counteroffer is the best option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

I want to keep as much of item 5 as possible.\n\nLet's try to get a value close to my outside offer.\nI want to keep around 243/67 ~ 3.6 i.e 4 units of Item 5.\nLet's try counteroffer [4, 3, 2, 4, 0].\nMy value would be (0 * 67) + (4 * 28) + (3 * 2) + (2 * 14) + (4 * 21) = 0 + 112 + 6 + 28 + 84 = 230.\n\nThat is close to my outside offer. Let's see a slightly better one.\ncounteroffer [3, 2, 1, 3, 0]\nI get item 1 (1 * 28), item 2 (1 * 2), item 3 (1 * 14), item 4 (1 * 21), and item 5 (4 * 67)\nValue to me is 28 + 2 + 14 + 21 + 268 = 333\n\nI should offer something that benefits me above my outside offer. Let's offer the following to player 1, [3,2,1,3,0] meaning keep the rest. My payoff is 333.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 3, 0]}\n```",

Therefore, if I accepted this offer, I would receive 253.\n\n### Counteroffer Consideration:\nI should consider making a counteroffer that results in a higher personal value than 253 assuming Player 2 might accept it. Any counteroffer needs to offer less value to Player 2 than what they currently are demanding, but more than the outside option or alternative I am willing to accept in the case they reject it.\n\nLet's formulate a counteroffer. I want to ensure the offer I keep for myself is substantially more valuable, so consider offering [2, 1, 1, 2, 1] to Player 2, so that I keep [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]. \n\nCalculate the value of the final allocation:\n- For 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n- For 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n- For 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n- For 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n- For 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n\nTotal Value with Counteroffer = 415.\n\nThe counteroffer increases my value from 253 to 415, if Player 2 accepts. However, post-negotiation adjustments due to rounding discount effects should also play a role in final consideration, but at Stage 2 it's less diminished than during Stage 3.\n\n### Decision:\nConsidering the above, I'll make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

My private values are 28, 2, 14, 21, and 67 for items 1 through 5, respectively. My outside offer is 243. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(2 * 28) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 14) + (2 * 21) + (1 * 67) = 56 + 2 + 14 + 42 + 67 = 181\n\nSince it is round 2, the current offer to me is worth 181 * 0.9 = 162.9\n\nNow, I compare this to my outside offer of 243. Since 162.9 is less than 243, accepting the offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, I need to consider a counteroffer. I have the following amounts of items to offer: 4, 3, 2, 4, 4.\nThe current offer leaves me with:\nItem 1: 4 - 2 = 2\nItem 2: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 3: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 4: 4 - 2 = 2\nItem 5: 4 - 1 = 3\nMy total value if I accept this: (2 * 28) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 14) + (2 * 21) + (3 * 67) = 56 + 4 + 14 + 42 + 201 = 317\nTotal discounted value in this case = 317 * 0.9 = 285.3\n\nI need to find an offer to player 1 that is attractive for them but also gives me at least slightly more than 243 / 0.9 = 270\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give them a little more than they asked for in the first round, in order to push the value to me past my outside offer of 243. I offered them [3, 2, 1, 3, 0] in the first round. Let's evaluate giving Player 1 [2, 2, 1, 2, 1].\n\nMy values if I offer [2, 2, 1, 2, 1] to player 1:\nRemaining items for me:\nItem 1: 4 - 2 = 2\nItem 2: 3 - 2 = 1\nItem 3: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 4: 4 - 2 = 2\nItem 5: 4 - 1 = 3\nValue to me: (2 * 28) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 14) + (2 * 21) + (3 * 67) = 56 + 2 + 14 + 42 + 201 = 315\n\nDiscounted Value: 315 * 0.9 = 283.5. This is greater than my outside offer, so this seems reasonable.\n\nLet's consider one further calculation to see if there's a cheaper option. How about [3, 1, 1, 3, 1]?\nRemaining Items to me: [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]\nValue to me: (1 * 28) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 14) + (1 * 21) + (3 * 67) = 28 + 4 + 14 + 21 + 201 = 268\nDiscounted Value: 268 * 0.9 = 241.2.

Looking at the negotiation history, Player 1 initially offered [1, 3, 2, 2, 0] and then slightly improved their offer to [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]. This suggests they are willing to give me more of item 2. Given that it's round 2, and there's only one round left, I'm unlikely to get a significantly better offer than what I could get by walking away.\n\nHowever, let's see if I can construct a counteroffer that would be better than walking away for both players. If I give the other player close to the initial amounts they offered and keep the rest for myself, I can maximize my returns. Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]. Given the small number of remaining rounds, I want to propose something that is better than my outside offer, but hopefully not *so* good that player 1 would prefer to walk.\n\nLet's try offering them [3, 5, 3, 3, 1]. That would mean I keep [1, 2, 2, 2, 0]. The valuation of what I keep would be:\n(1 * 32) + (2 * 86) + (2 * 6) + (2 * 72) + (0 * 18) = 32 + 172 + 12 + 144 + 0 = 360. The discounted value is 360 * 0.9 = 324. This is still significantly lower than my outside offer, so I shouldn't pursue this.\n\nGiven that there's only one round left, and Player 1's offers have been far lower than what I could get from walking away, I will choose to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means they want me to have all 5 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. I have to evaluate this offer and compare it to my outside offer of 391, considering the discount factor of 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n*   5 units of item 1: 5 * 42 = 210\n*   0 units of item 2: 0 * 1 = 0\n*   0 units of item 3: 0 * 20 = 0\n*   0 units of item 4: 0 * 78 = 0\n*   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 19 = 19\nTotal value of the offer: 210 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 19 = 229\n\nNow, let's discount this value to the present value by multiplying it by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9:\nDiscounted value = 229 * 0.9 = 206.1\n\nThis discounted value (206.1) is less than my outside offer of 391. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a bad choice.\n\nNext, let's consider walking away. If I walk away, I get my outside offer of 391.\n\nFinally, let's consider making a counteroffer. To make a reasonable counteroffer, I need to figure out what Player 1 might value. Since I don't know their values, I'll aim for a split that's roughly in line with their initial offer, but gives me more value. Player 1 offered me almost all of item 1 and a little bit of item 5. Let's offer them all of item 2, most of item 5, and the sole unit of item 4. I'll keep a larger portion of item 1, and a larger portion of item 3, than they initially offered me. How about this counteroffer?\nOffer to Player 1: [0, 5, 0, 1, 4]\n\nThis means I would get:\n*   5 units of item 1: 5 * 42 = 210\n*   0 units of item 2: 0 * 1 = 0\n*   4 units of item 3: 4 * 20 = 80\n*   0 units of item 4: 0 * 78 = 0\n*   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 19 = 19\n\nMy total value: 210 + 0 + 80 + 0 + 19 = 309\nDiscounted value: 309 * 0.9 = 278.1\n\nThis counteroffer improves upon my original offer value to me, but is still lower than my outside offer. It is the last round, and I will be treated as walking away if I make a counteroffer, so it's no longer worth considering it. \n\nTherefore, the best action is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, I can use the full value without discounting.\n\nStart by proposing an initial offer and calculate the retained value:\n\nLet's try keeping:\n- 3 units of item 1 (1 to Player 2)\n- 0 units of item 2 (2 to Player 2)\n- 2 units of item 3 (1 to Player 2)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (2 to Player 2)\n- 3 units of item 5 (2 to Player 2)\n\nValue I retain from this offer:\n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 13 = 39\n- Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 58 = 0\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 11 = 22\n- Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 75 = 75\n- Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 98 = 294\n\nTotal retained value = 39 + 0 + 22 + 75 + 294 = 430\n\nMy retained value must be higher than 694. The current configuration has a total value of only 430, which is less than 694. Thus, I need to adjust my offer.\n\nLet's adjust and attempt a more favorable configuration for retaining value:\n\nFinal revised offer:\n- 2 units of item 1 (2 to Player 2)\n- 0 units of item 2 (2 to Player 2)\n- 2 units of item 3 (1 to Player 2)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (2 to Player 2)\n- 2 units of item 5 (3 to Player 2)\n\nRecalculate retained value:\n- Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 13 = 26\n- Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 58 = 0\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 11 = 22\n- Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 75 = 75\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 98 = 196\n\nTotal retained value = 26 + 0 + 22 + 75 + 196 = 319\n\nThis configuration is still below 694. Let's try one more adjustment:\n\nFinal offer adjustment:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (3 to Player 2)\n- 0 units of item 2 (2 to Player 2)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (2 to Player 2)\n- 0 units of item 4 (3 to Player 2)\n- 4 units of item 5 (1 to Player 2)\n\nRecalculate retained value:\n- Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 13 = 13\n- Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 58 = 0\n- Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 11 = 11\n- Item 4: 0 unit \u00d7 75 = 0\n- Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 98 = 392\n\nTotal retained value = 13 + 0 + 11 + 0 + 392 = 416\n\nUnfortunately, with these calculations, it looks like I cannot construct a realistic offer that provides me at least 694 value without forcing a completely uneven and likely unacceptable offer configuration for Player 2. Given that any favorable configuration is proving inadequate, and the values are random, I only see WALK as a rational choice at this stage.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Therefore, I must ensure that the value of the items I retain, adjusted for the discount factor, surpasses 851 when considering negotiation proceeds over more rounds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value if I give Player 2 some of each item, starting with one possible offer where I keep the following for myself:\n\n- Keep 3 units of Item 1 (giving 1 to Player 2)\n- Keep 2 units of Item 2 (giving 1 to Player 2)\n- Keep 1 unit of Item 3 (giving 1 to Player 2)\n- Keep 4 units of Item 4 (giving 2 to Player 2)\n- Keep 6 units of Item 5 (giving 1 to Player 2)\n\nCalculating the total value I get from this offer:\n\n- Value from 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n- Value from 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n- Value from 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n- Value from 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n- Value from 6 units of Item 5: 6 \u00d7 44 = 264\n\nTotal value = 264 + 196 + 17 + 144 + 264 = 885\n\nSince 885 > 851 (my outside offer when adjusted by round discount factor to a minimum acceptable level beyond round 1), I will make this my initial offer to Player 2 and see if negotiation can proceed favorably.\n\nThe counteroffer I propose is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}",

Since 658 < 967, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nI will now consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my gains, but I also need to offer Player 1 enough that they won't simply walk away. A good starting point for a counteroffer is to try and split the difference between what they offered and a more equitable division, while ensuring I exceed my outside offer when discounted in future rounds.\n\nHowever, since it's Round 1 and the discount factor is 0.9, I need to have a final amount exceeding 967/0.9= 1074.44.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give the other player close to nothing:\n*   Item 1: 0 units for Player 1 means I get 6 units.  6 * 61 = 366\n*   Item 2: 0 units for Player 1 means I get 2 units.  2 * 37 = 74\n*   Item 3: 0 units for Player 1 means I get 4 units.  4 * 56 = 224\n*   Item 4: 0 units for Player 1 means I get 4 units.  4 * 60 = 240\n*   Item 5: 0 units for Player 1 means I get 6 units.  6 * 12 = 72\n\nTotal value of this offer to me: 366 + 74 + 224 + 240 + 72 = 976.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 160. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 621 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 249. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 573 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

However, considering the already high value of the current offer, achieving significantly higher value might be difficult.\n\nA possible counteroffer would be: Offer slightly fewer items to Player 2.\n\n**Counteroffer: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]**\n\nIf I counteroffer with [1, 0, 1, 1, 0], the respective value calculation is:\n\n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 53 per unit = 159\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 14 per unit = 28\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 27 per unit = 108\n- Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 65 per unit = 130\n- Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 32 per unit = 128\n\n**Total value = 159 + 28 + 108 + 130 + 128 = 553**\n\nAdjusted value in round 2: \n- Adjusted value = 553 \u00d7 0.9 = 497.7\n\nThis counteroffer gives me 497.7, less than the current adjusted offer value of 527.4.\n\nHence, the best course of action is to accept the current offer.\n\n**Conclusion: The current offer has a higher value for me than my outside offer and a potential counteroffer does not improve my position enough.**\n\n**Final Decision:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 843 after discounting.\n\n6. **Formulating a Counteroffer:**\n   - If I want to keep more high-value items:\n     - For maximum value, retaining more of item 2 (value 100) and item 4 (value 97) is crucial.\n   - Proposed counteroffer:\n     - Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n     - Means I keep: [1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 2 of item 5]\n\n7. **Calculate My Value for Proposed Counteroffer:**\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n   - Total direct value = 823\n\n8. **Apply the Discount Factor for Round 2:**\n   - Adjusted value = 823 \u00d7 0.9 = 740.7\n\nThe total value after discounting is still below the outside offer. I will need to attempt a more favorable counteroffer to exceed the outside offer value of 843. \n\n9. **Final Counteroffer:**\n   - To approach or exceed the outside offer value more closely, let's modify:\n   - Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 3, 5]\n   - Means I keep: [1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5]\n\n10. **Calculate My Value for Final Counteroffer:**\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 83 = 166\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n    - Total direct value = 835\n\n11. **Apply the Discount Factor for Round 2:**\n    - Adjusted value = 835 \u00d7 0.9 = 751.5\n\nDespite repeated attempts to find a balance, achieving a counteroffer with value over 843 after discounting seems difficult given the constraints, while keeping the deal appealing for Player 2. Thus, I'll have to proceed optimistically with an attempt but I need to adjust my strategy if this round doesn't succeed.\n\n**Action Taken:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 5]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Compare to my outside offer:\n   - My outside offer is 1133.\n\nThe current offer, after discounting, is significantly lower than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting the current offer is not advisable.\n\n3. Consider making a counteroffer that gives me a value above my outside offer when adjusted for the discount.\n\nTo achieve a better outcome, I'll propose a counteroffer aiming for a higher total value for myself. Here's a potential counteroffer:\n\n- I'll give Player 2: [1, 0, 4, 2, 1]\n  - Keeping it for myself: [3, 4, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCalculating my value of this counteroffer:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 x 99 = 297\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 x 96 = 384\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 x 67 = 134\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 x 92 = 276\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 24 = 24\n\nTotal value to me = 297 + 384 + 134 + 276 + 24 = 1115\n\nAdjusted value considering discount = 1115 x 0.9 = 1003.5, which still doesn't surpass my outside offer. \n\nLet's try a new counteroffer:\n- I'll give Player 2: [1, 0, 5, 2, 1]\n  - Keeping it for myself: [3, 4, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCalculating my value of this counteroffer:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 x 99 = 297\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 x 96 = 384\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 x 67 = 67\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 x 92 = 276\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 24 = 24\n\nTotal value to me = 297 + 384 + 67 + 276 + 24 = 1048\n\nAdjusted value considering discount = 1048 x 0.9 = 943.2, still lower than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, none of these counteroffers exceed my outside offer value.

                    "response": "To decide on the best course of action in this negotiation round, let's first evaluate the current offer from Player 2 and compare it to my outside offer value.\n\n### Evaluating the Current Offer\nThe current offer from Player 2 is [5, 0, 0, 2, 0], which means:\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nLet's calculate the total value to me for this offer:\n- Value of 5 units of item 1: \\( 5 \\times 47 = 235 \\)\n- Value of 0 units of item 2: \\( 0 \\times 21 = 0 \\)\n- Value of 0 units of item 3: \\( 0 \\times 47 = 0 \\)\n- Value of 2 units of item 4: \\( 2 \\times 57 = 114 \\)\n- Value of 0 units of item 5: \\( 0 \\times 74 = 0 \\)\n\nTotal value = \\( 235 + 0 + 0 + 114 + 0 = 349 \\)\n\nAfter considering the discount factor gamma at round 2, the discounted value:\n\\[ \\text{Discounted value} = 349 \\times 0.9^{1} = 314.1 \\]\n\n### Comparison with Outside Offer\n\nMy outside offer value is 607. Given the discounted value of the current offer is 314.1, which is less than my outside offer of 607, I should not accept the current offer.\n\n### Consider Counteroffer\n\nThe previous offers were:\n- My offer: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]\n  - My remaining items: [5, 0, 1, 3, 1]\n  - My value: \\( 235 + 0 + 47 + 171 + 74 = 527 \\) \n  - Discounted value at round 1: \\( 527 \\times 1 = 527 \\)\n\nGiven the remaining items that offer better value than the current proposal but still insufficient to exceed my outside offer, a counteroffer must be more appealing.\n\nOne better counteroffer, that maximizes my value while being fairer than the previous ones, should focus on keeping high-value items like item 5. Let's consider:\n- Offer Player 2: [5, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n  - My remaining items: [0, 0, 3, 2, 1]\n  \nCalculate my value:\n- Value of 0 units of item 1: \\( 0 \\times 47 = 0 \\)\n- Value of 0 units of item 2: \\( 0 \\times 21 = 0 \\)\n- Value of 3 units of item 3: \\( 3 \\times 47 = 141 \\)\n- Value of 2 units of item 4: \\( 2 \\times 57 = 114 \\)\n- Value of 1 units of item 5: \\( 1 \\times 74 = 74 \\)\n\nTotal value = \\( 0 + 0 + 141 + 114 + 74 = 329 \\)\n\nDiscounted value now:\n\\[ \\text{Discounted value} = 329 \\times 0.9^{1} = 296.1 \\]\n\nAlthough the value calculation is still below my outside offer, offering more equitable distribution could prompt Player 2 to make a viable counteroffer closer to acceptable standards before the final round. Currently, I should WALK since the best achievable values by round 2 cannot match my outside offer of 607.\n\nThus, given the unsatisfactory terms against my solid fallback position, I choose:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

Since 427 is significantly greater than 163, accepting the offer is better than walking away *at this point*. However, it's early in the negotiation, and I might be able to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider a possible counteroffer.  I have:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 6 units of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nPlayer 1 offered me:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nIf I give Player 1 all of item 2, 3, 4 and 5 while keeping all of item 1, the negotiation will be more profitable. The offer to player 1 would look like [3, 2, 2, 3, 1] and I would keep 3 items 1, which will give me 3 * 55 = 165. This amount is not greater than my outside offer so I will proceed with another strategy.\n\nI am going to make a counteroffer that is only slightly better for me.\n\nCounteroffer: Offer Player 1 [1, 5, 4, 1, 1].\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 2 units of item 1 (2 * 55 = 110)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (1 * 32 = 32)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (1 * 78 = 78)\n- 2 units of item 4 (2 * 51 = 102)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (1 * 65 = 65)\n\nTotal value: 110 + 32 + 78 + 102 + 65 = 387\n\nWhile this total value is lower than the initial offer, I anticipate further rounds might lead to lower value due to the discount factor. Therefore I will make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 4, 1, 1]}\n```",

Since 314 > 39, accepting is better than walking away at this point. However, I can also make a counteroffer.

Assuming player 1 also has random values, a somewhat even split is usually good to begin with to see their reaction.

Let me think again.\nSince item 5 is my most valued, I want to retain it as much as possible, and I'm happy to give away item 2 as it's my least valued.\nHow about a counteroffer of [2, 0, 2, 4, 0].\nThis leaves me with:\n- 3 - 2 = 1 unit of item 1 (value = 1 * 25 = 25)\n- 3 - 0 = 3 units of item 2 (value = 3 * 1 = 3)\n- 3 - 2 = 1 unit of item 3 (value = 1 * 11 = 11)\n- 5 - 4 = 1 unit of item 4 (value = 1 * 88 = 88)\n- 3 - 0 = 3 units of item 5 (value = 3 * 100 = 300)\nTotal value to me: 25 + 3 + 11 + 88 + 300 = 427\n\nSince 427 is greater than 314, and much greater than my outside offer of 39, I should propose the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 4, 0]}\n```",

Calculate the value of each item under this offer:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 98 = 98\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n\n   Total value of this offer to me: 98 + 21 + 35 + 90 = 244\n\n2. **Discount Factor:**\n\n   Since this is round 2, the discount factor is gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n   Therefore, the present value of the offer is 244 \u00d7 0.9 = 219.6.\n\n3. **Comparing Against Outside Offer:**\n\n   My outside offer value is 149. The present value of the current offer (219.6) is greater than my outside offer. Thus, it is considered acceptable.\n\n4. **Considering a Counteroffer:**\n\n   However, let's ensure we can't negotiate a slightly better deal:\n\n   My initial offer was [1, 2, 1, 0, 3], which left me with:\n   - 2 units of item 1\n   - 1 unit of item 2\n   - 1 unit of item 3\n   - 1 unit of item 4\n   - 2 units of item 5\n   \n   My initial offer's value to me was:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n\n   Total initial offer value: 196 + 21 + 35 + 1 + 90 = 343.\n\n   Discounted value still good: 343 \u00d7 0.9 = 308.7.\n\nGiven that the current offer already surpasses the outside offer after discounting and I cannot easily maximize the benefit further without extensive risk (and being aware that this is round 2), the prudent option is to accept the current offer rather than risk a counteroffer being rejected or deteriorating the negotiation further. \n\nTherefore, the action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 924. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 948 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the best course of action, I need to make an offer that maximizes my value over my outside offer value of 924. Let's go through each step:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Potential Value**: \n   - There are 0 units of item 1, so no value from item 1.\n   - Value for item 2 = 3 units * 68 value/unit = 204\n   - Value for item 3 = 4 units * 85 value/unit = 340\n   - Value for item 4 = 4 units * 34 value/unit = 136\n   - Value for item 5 = 5 units * 50 value/unit = 250\n   - Total potential value from all items = 930\n\n2. **Compare with Outside Offer**: \n   - My outside offer is 924, which is very close to the maximum potential value of 930.\n   \n3. **Strategy for Initial Offer**:\n   - Since I want a deal that is better than my outside offer and given the total possible value is only slightly above my outside offer, I should aim to keep items that have the highest value per unit first.\n   - The most valuable item per unit is item 3 (85 per unit), followed by item 2 (68 per unit), item 5 (50 per unit), item 4 (34 per unit), and item 1 (79 per unit, but not available).\n   \n4. **Make an Initial Offer**:\n   - Offer a balanced distribution that minimally affects my total value. A reasonable start is to offer:\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   \n5. **Calculate My Retained Value**:\n   - Retained from my offer:\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 68 = 136\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 85 = 170\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 34 = 68\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 50 = 150\n     - Total value retained = 524\n\nSince the retained value (524) added to my guaranteed offer value (924) would still ensure a final adjustment closer to the negotiation grid potential, it seems reasonable to structure an offer based on maintaining a possible marginal difference considering each element's impact weighted by unit valuation:\n\n**Offer to Player 2**:\n\n- [2, 1, 2, 2]\n\nI will propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

Since 160 is less than 366, accepting the offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I have the following items: 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My values are 80, 40, 10, 30, and 10 respectively.\n\nTo make a worthwhile counteroffer, I need to offer Player 1 enough to make them accept, while still getting more than 366 for myself. Let's start by considering the total value of all items:\n* Item 1: 5 * 80 = 400\n* Item 2: 1 * 40 = 40\n* Item 3: 4 * 10 = 40\n* Item 4: 6 * 30 = 180\n* Item 5: 1 * 10 = 10\nTotal value = 400 + 40 + 40 + 180 + 10 = 670\n\nSince it's round 1, and gamma = 0.9, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So there is no discount.\n\nI need to decide what to offer Player 1. It's difficult to know Player 1's values without any information from previous rounds. Let's make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 slightly more than half the total value of the items, let's aim for a total value for me that is at least around 366. This is just a guess.\n\nI will offer player 1 [3, 0, 2, 3, 0]\nThat means I keep [2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\nMy value would be:\n2 * 80 + 1 * 40 + 2 * 10 + 3 * 30 + 1 * 10 = 160 + 40 + 20 + 90 + 10 = 320.\nThis is worse than walking away.\n\nI need to offer a deal that is better than walking away. I'll revise my offer a bit.\nI will offer player 1 [2, 0, 1, 2, 0]\nThat means I keep [3, 1, 3, 4, 1]\nMy value would be:\n3 * 80 + 1 * 40 + 3 * 10 + 4 * 30 + 1 * 10 = 240 + 40 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 440\n\nThis is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",

My values for each item are 74, 42, 16, 44, and 84, respectively. I have 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 8 units of item 5 in total. My outside offer is 1040. I need to calculate the value of the current offer and compare it to my outside offer.\n\nThe current offer means I receive:\n- 1 unit of item 1 * 74 = 74\n- 1 unit of item 2 * 42 = 42\n- 3 units of item 3 * 16 = 48\n- 4 units of item 4 * 44 = 176\n- 4 units of item 5 * 84 = 336\n\nTotal value of the current offer = 74 + 42 + 48 + 176 + 336 = 676\n\nSince 676 is less than my outside offer of 1040, I should not accept the current offer. Now I need to consider making a counteroffer. Let's calculate the total value of all the items for me:\n- 3 units of item 1 * 74 = 222\n- 3 units of item 2 * 42 = 126\n- 7 units of item 3 * 16 = 112\n- 7 units of item 4 * 44 = 308\n- 8 units of item 5 * 84 = 672\nTotal value = 222 + 126 + 112 + 308 + 672 = 1440\n\nTo make a counteroffer, I need to decide how much of each item to offer Player 1. My goal is to get a deal that is better than my outside offer, considering the discount factor in later rounds. In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so the face value is what matters at this moment.\n\nLet's aim for an offer that gives Player 1 slightly more than half the total value. That would require Player 1 to also accept, and would net me more than my outside offer. Since I value item 5 the most, I want to keep as much of it as possible. Let's start with the goal of giving the player about 750 in value from my perspective.\n\nAfter some experimentation, consider offering Player 1 the following: [2, 2, 4, 5, 5]. This means I keep [1, 1, 3, 2, 3] for myself.\nValue to me:\n- 1 * 74 = 74\n- 1 * 42 = 42\n- 3 * 16 = 48\n- 2 * 44 = 88\n- 3 * 84 = 252\nTotal value = 74 + 42 + 48 + 88 + 252 = 504\n\nValue to Player 1 (based on my values):\n- 2 * 74 = 148\n- 2 * 42 = 84\n- 4 * 16 = 64\n- 5 * 44 = 220\n- 5 * 84 = 420\nTotal Value = 148 + 84 + 64 + 220 + 420 = 936\nSince the game is zero-sum (fixed number of goods), this counteroffer is not a good idea, since it yields me a very poor result.\n\nI'll try another counteroffer. Give player 1: [1, 1, 4, 5, 6]\nValue to me:\n- 2 * 74 = 148\n- 2 * 42 = 84\n- 3 * 16 = 48\n- 2 * 44 = 88\n- 2 * 84 = 168\nTotal: 536\nValue to player 1:\n74 + 42 + 64 + 220 + 504 = 904\n\nI think I will try giving the player 1 unit each of 1 and 2, a bit more of 3 and 4, and hold onto the high value item 5. [1, 1, 3, 4, 6]. This is similar to the initial offer but I'm keeping more of item 5.\n\nValue to me is:\n- 2*74 + 2*42 + 4*16 + 3*44 + 2*84 = 148 + 84 + 64 + 132 + 168 = 596.\n\nI am going to counteroffer [1, 1, 3, 4, 6].

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 4, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 3, 4, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 4, 6]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the best course of action, I need to evaluate the current offer in terms of my values and compare it to my outside offer. Let's calculate this:\n\n**Current Offer Evaluation:**\n- Item 1: 2 units (3 total - 1 offered to Player 2) \u00d7 34 = 68\n- Item 2: 2 units (3 total - 1 offered to Player 2) \u00d7 57 = 114\n- Item 3: 4 units (7 total - 3 offered to Player 2) \u00d7 61 = 244\n- Item 4: 3 units (7 total - 4 offered to Player 2) \u00d7 18 = 54\n- Item 5: 2 units (8 total - 6 offered to Player 2) \u00d7 24 = 48\n\nTotal value = 68 + 114 + 244 + 54 + 48 = 528\n\n**Discounting for the Round:**\nSince it is round 2 and the discount rate is 0.9, the present value of accepting this offer now is:\nValue = 528 \u00d7 0.9^(2-1) = 528 \u00d7 0.9 = 475.2\n\n**Comparison with Outside Offer:**\nMy outside offer value is 522. The discounted value of the current offer (475.2) is less than the outside offer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the lower value of the current offer after discounting compared to my outside option, I should not accept the current offer in its present form. I should propose a counteroffer that provides me a higher value.\n\n**Proposing a Counteroffer:**\nTo maximize my value, ideally, I need to propose giving away fewer items or lower-valued items while still remaining within a range acceptable to Player 2. Consider offering Player 2:\n- [1, 1, 2, 4, 5]\n\nLet's calculate the value for me:\n- Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 34 = 68\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 57 = 114\n- Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 61 = 305\n- Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 18 = 54\n- Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 24 = 72\n\nTotal value = 68 + 114 + 305 + 54 + 72 = 613\n\nDiscounted Value = 613 \u00d7 0.9 = 551.7\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of 551.7 after discounting, which exceeds my outside option of 522.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 4, 5]}\n```",

Thus, the present value of accepting this offer is 696 * 0.9 = 626.4.\n\nMy outside offer is worth 1040. Since 626.4 is less than 1040, accepting is not a good choice.\n\nNow let's consider a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 something that is better than my current offer to them [1, 1, 2, 4, 5] but also ensures that what remains with me is worth more than 1040 / 0.9 = 1155.56.\n\nLet me calculate the value of giving all items to Player 1. In this case I get only my outside option 1040. To have value more then that in round 2, I need to have a total value of 1040 / 0.9 = 1155.55.\n\nTherefore, I need a combination of items that are left with me to value more then 1155.56.\n\nLet's think if it is possible to find something beneficial in a single round. Let's leave nothing for Player 1 and let's check if the total value is more then 1155.56\n\n3 * 74 + 3 * 42 + 7 * 16 + 7 * 44 + 8 * 84 = 222 + 126 + 112 + 308 + 672 = 1440\n\nSo giving all items to myself will worth 1440 * 0.9 = 1296 which is bigger then 1040.\n\nLet's consider offering the Player 1 the offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nMy value for this offer is:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 * 74 = 222\n*   Item 2: 3 * 42 = 126\n*   Item 3: 7 * 16 = 112\n*   Item 4: 7 * 44 = 308\n*   Item 5: 8 * 84 = 672\n*   Total value = 222 + 126 + 112 + 308 + 672 = 1440\n\nSince it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Thus, the present value of accepting this offer is 1440 * 0.9 = 1296.\nSince the value 1296 > 1040, it is better to offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] than WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

To strategize, I'd prefer to keep items that have the highest value to me (Item 2 and Item 5 in particular) and see if I can create an offer that provides me a greater value than my outside offer, seeking to secure items that I value more.\n\nTo find a possible offer that satisfies these criteria, consider minimizing my offer for the items I value less and offering more of the ones I value lower relative to Player 2. Given my valuation prioritization, I'll keep as many units of Item 2 and Item 5 as possible.\n\nFor an initial offer:\n- Give the opponent fewer profitable items to me, leaving myself with more valuable items.\n- Aim for a value close to but greater than 664, considering I can negotiate across rounds.\n\nI'll propose the following initial counteroffer, attempting to maximize my initial value while leaving room for negotiation:\n\n- Offer Player 2: 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n- Keeping for myself: 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\nCalculating the value I am keeping:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n- Item 2: 6 \u00d7 90 = 540\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n\nTotal Value I Keep = 60 + 540 + 38 + 111 + 207 = 956\n\nSince this value exceeds my outside offer (664) and I can negotiate downward if needed due to rounds adjustments, this is a reasonable starting point.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 1, 3, 3, 1]}",

This means they are offering me 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are:\n- Item 1: 13\n- Item 2: 24\n- Item 3: 86\n- Item 4: 8\n- Item 5: 12\n\nLet's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 * 13 = 65\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 24 = 24\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 86 = 258\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 * 8 = 24\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 12 = 12\nTotal value of the offer = 65 + 24 + 258 + 24 + 12 = 383\n\nMy outside offer is 550. Since 383 < 550, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I need to figure out a reasonable offer that Player 1 might accept, while still giving me a value greater than 550 * 0.9 = 495 (accounting for the discount factor in round 2).\n\nThe total number of each item is:\n- Item 1: 8\n- Item 2: 7\n- Item 3: 5\n- Item 4: 6\n- Item 5: 4\n\nI need to decide how many units of each item to offer to Player 1. A simple strategy would be to try and take the largest share of item 3, since my value for item 3 is high.\n\nLet's see if offering Player 1 half of each item would be reasonable: [4, 3, 2, 3, 2]\nMy value for what I keep is then:\n- Item 1: 4 * 13 = 52\n- Item 2: 4 * 24 = 96\n- Item 3: 3 * 86 = 258\n- Item 4: 3 * 8 = 24\n- Item 5: 2 * 12 = 24\nTotal value = 52 + 96 + 258 + 24 + 24 = 454\n\nThis is still below 550, so walking away is still better. Since we are in round 1, we will divide the value by a discount factor if there is a round 2. If we walk away, we receive our outside offer of 550 * 0.9 = 495 in round 2.\n\nI should make a counteroffer. I want to try to get at least 495. Let's propose a deal where I keep most of Item 3, the item I value the most, and also ensure that Player 1 gets some items. Try to balance this to be greater than walking away next round.\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [4, 3, 1, 3, 2].\nMy value = (4*13 + 4*24 + 4*86 + 3*8 + 2*12) = 52 + 96 + 344 + 24 + 24 = 540\n540 > 383\nPlayer 1's offer gives me a value of 383.\nMy outside offer will be 550 if negotiations fail.\n\nSince I have a high value for Item 3, let me counter offer that I take the majority of Item 3.\nCounter offer: [4, 3, 1, 3, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

This represents what Player 1 is offering *to me*.\n\nMy values for each item are:\n- Item 1: 60\n- Item 2: 10\n- Item 3: 52\n- Item 4: 100\n- Item 5: 91\n\nSo, the value of the current offer is:\n(2 * 60) + (4 * 10) + (1 * 52) + (3 * 100) + (2 * 91) = 120 + 40 + 52 + 300 + 182 = 694\n\nSince this is round 1, there is no discount factor yet (gamma^0 = 1). Thus the value of the current offer is 694.\n\nMy outside offer is 830. Since 694 < 830, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, I need to consider a potential counteroffer. The goal is to find an offer that Player 1 might accept and that would give me a value greater than 830. Since this is the first round, I want to aim for a relatively generous offer to increase the likelihood of acceptance.\n\nLet's try to determine a somewhat fair split. I have the following quantities of items:\n- Item 1: 7\n- Item 2: 10\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 6\n- Item 5: 4\n\nIf we split each roughly in half, I would give Player 1 approximately:\n- Item 1: 3 or 4\n- Item 2: 5\n- Item 3: 1 or 2\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 2\n\nLet's examine the case where I offer [4, 5, 2, 3, 2] to Player 1. This means I keep:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 5\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThe value of what I keep would be:\n(3 * 60) + (5 * 10) + (1 * 52) + (3 * 100) + (2 * 91) = 180 + 50 + 52 + 300 + 182 = 764\n\nSince 764 < 830, this split is not good for me.\n\nLet's try giving more to Player 1. What if I offered them close to everything, keeping just enough to beat my outside offer of 830? To achieve this, I would want to offer Player 1 almost all of items 2 and 3, which I value low, and retain the items I value most.\n\nLet's try a different approach. I want to find a counteroffer that gives me a value just above my outside offer of 830. This involves some trial and error.\n\nHere's a possible counteroffer: [5, 8, 2, 4, 3].\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be:\n(2 * 60) + (2 * 10) + (1 * 52) + (2 * 100) + (1 * 91) = 120 + 20 + 52 + 200 + 91 = 483\n\nThis is too low! I need to keep more.\n\nLet's try offering [2, 6, 1, 2, 1].\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 5\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 3\n\nMy value would be:\n(5 * 60) + (4 * 10) + (2 * 52) + (4 * 100) + (3 * 91) = 300 + 40 + 104 + 400 + 273 = 1117\n\nThis is much better than 830!

So, I need to revise to offer fewer high-value items.\n\nLet's consider a more optimized offer:\n\nOffer Player 2:\n\n- 5 units of item 1 (all)\n- 0 units of item 2 (none)\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThen, I would retain:\n\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nRe-calculating the value:\n\n- Value from item 1: 0 units \u00d7 1 value/unit = 0\n- Value from item 2: 4 units \u00d7 87 value/unit = 348\n- Value from item 3: 3 units \u00d7 8 value/unit = 24\n- Value from item 4: 2 units \u00d7 16 value/unit = 32\n- Value from item 5: 2 units \u00d7 31 value/unit = 62\n\nTotal value: 0 + 348 + 24 + 32 + 62 = 466\n\nThis value is still below my outside offer of 528, so I should walk away unless during the next offer round the value achieved surpasses the outside offer when considering the next round's discount factor.\n\nFor now, I will make a counteroffer that maximizes my retention of high-value items and meets a potentially appealing offer for Player 2:\n\nOffer Player 2:\n\n- 5 units of item 1 (all)\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nCalculating again:\n\n- Value from item 1: 0\n- Value from item 2: 4 units \u00d7 87 = 348\n- Value from item 3: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n- Value from item 4: 3 units \u00d7 16 = 48\n- Value from item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 31 = 31\n\nTotal Value = 0 + 348 + 16 + 48 + 31 = 443\n\nI'll offer this to make the most out of rounds 1, and it's still below 528, but should encourage further negotiation. If next round absorbs less value, I'll consider walking away or an even lesser offer to Player 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 1, 1, 2]}",

I want to maximize my value, so I should try to get as much of item 3 and item 4 as possible, since they have the highest values for me (74 and 67 respectively). I need to leave Player 1 with enough value to make them accept the deal. A simple split would be to give Player 1 half of each item, but this may not be optimal. I can't know Player 1's values, so I'll start with a more aggressive offer and see what happens. Since this is the first round, I have time to adjust. I will make a counteroffer where I give away very little and see how Player 1 responds.\n\nCounteroffer:\n- Item 1: 0 units to Player 1\n- Item 2: 0 units to Player 1\n- Item 3: 0 units to Player 1\n- Item 4: 0 units to Player 1\n- Item 5: 0 units to Player 1\n\nThis means I keep all the items for myself:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 4 units\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy value for this is:\n(2 * 5) + (4 * 19) + (2 * 74) + (4 * 67) + (3 * 39) = 10 + 76 + 148 + 268 + 117 = 619\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer, and provides the maximum possible value.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of my approach:\n\n1. **Understand Available Items and Values:**\n   - Total units available: \n     - Item 1: 7 units\n     - Item 2: 7 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 4 units\n     - Item 5: 3 units\n   - My values per item:\n     - Item 1: 63\n     - Item 2: 100\n     - Item 3: 6\n     - Item 4: 4\n     - Item 5: 60\n\n2. **Calculate Total Current Value of All Items to Me:**\n   - Total value:\n     - = 7 * 63 + 7 * 100 + 3 * 6 + 4 * 4 + 3 * 60\n     - = 441 + 700 + 18 + 16 + 180\n     - = 1355\n\n3. **Plan for an Initial Counteroffer:**\n   - I need an offer that results in a total value greater than my outside offer of 1191.\n   - This means keeping enough valuable items to exceed 1191 in value when making my initial offer.\n\n4. **Formulate a Counteroffer:**\n   - Let's start by focusing on the item values and keeping a significant share of the highest value items (Item 2 and Item 1).\n   - Consider offering a smaller share of the highest valued items to Player 2 while maintaining a large portion for myself.\n\n5. **Example Counteroffer Proposal Calculation:**\n   - I will offer Player 2:\n     - Item 1: 2 units (Cost to me: 2 * 63 = 126)\n     - Item 2: 2 units (Cost to me: 2 * 100 = 200)\n     - Item 3: 2 units (Cost to me: 2 * 6 = 12)\n     - Item 4: 2 units (Cost to me: 2 * 4 = 8)\n     - Item 5: 1 unit (Cost to me: 1 * 60 = 60)\n   - Keeping for myself: \n     - Item 1: 5 units = 315\n     - Item 2: 5 units = 500\n     - Item 3: 1 unit = 6\n     - Item 4: 2 units = 8\n     - Item 5: 2 units = 120\n   - Total value to me from this allocation: \n     - = 315 + 500 + 6 + 8 + 120\n     - = 949\n   - Check if total exceeds my outside option (1191). This does not, so adjust the offer.\n\n6. **Adjust Counteroffer:**\n   - Adjust the counteroffer to increase my retained total value above 1191.\n   - Considering the above was insufficient, revise by offering less of the high-value items:\n     - Offer Player 2: [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n   - This allows me to keep:\n     - Item 1: 6 units = 378\n     - Item 2: 5 units = 500\n     - Item 3: 1 unit = 6\n     - Item 4: 3 units = 12\n     - Item 5: 2 units = 120\n   - New retained value: \n     - = 378 + 500 + 6 + 12 + 120\n     - = 1016 (not enough, further adjustment needed)\n\n7. **Final Counteroffer Proposal:**\n   - I will propose giving Player 2:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit, Item 2: 2 units, Item 3: 1 unit, Item 4: 1 unit, Item 5: 1 unit\n   - Keeping for myself yields values of:\n     - Item 1: 6 units = 6 * 63 = 378\n     - Item 2: 5 units = 5 * 100 = 500\n     - Item 3: 2 units = 2 * 6 = 12\n     - Item 4: 3 units = 3 * 4 = 12\n     - Item 5: 2 units = 2 * 60 = 120\n   - Total value: 378 + 500 + 12 + 12 + 120 = 1022 (still not 1191)\n   - Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 3, 3] keeps\n     - Item 1: 6 units = 378\n     - Item 2: 6 units = 600\n     - Item 3: 3 units = 18\n     - Item 4: 1 unit = 4\n     - Item 5: 0 units = 0\n   - Total value: 378 + 600 + 18 + 4 = 1000 (not feasible as the math reveals none surpasses 1191 - so must walk) \n\nAfter attempting several allocations, my retained value cannot reasonably exceed my outside offer.

Thus, I need to ensure I get at least 635 / 0.9 = 705.56 value from the items I keep.\n\nAvailable items:\nItem 1: 6 units\nItem 2: 3 units\nItem 3: 5 units\nItem 4: 3 units\nItem 5: 3 units\n\nThe current offer implies I would keep:\nItem 1: 6-4 = 2 units\nItem 2: 3-0 = 3 units\nItem 3: 5-3 = 2 units\nItem 4: 3-1 = 2 units\nItem 5: 3-2 = 1 unit\n\nThe value of these items to me is:\n2*8 + 3*27 + 2*35 + 2*87 + 1*62 = 16 + 81 + 70 + 174 + 62 = 403\n\nThis is less than 705.56, so any offer where I get the same as Player 1's current offer would not be acceptable.\n\nSince it is round 2, and I need a discounted value of 635, I can aim for 635/0.9 = 705.56 value this round, which makes a deal possible. However, it's likely Player 1 is not going to offer me much more than what they are now, since they are probably also aiming to optimize their own outcome, so it makes sense to WALK if they are not willing to give me items that give me at least 705.56 of value.\n\nTherefore, I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

So my better option, given this situation and game dynamics, is to:\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nSince the current offer value of 375 is greater than my outside offer of 370 and considering round dynamics in round 2 without future negotiation on higher yields, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 644. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 606 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine my initial offer, I need to compare any offer's result to my outside offer value of 644. Let's evaluate the entire pool of items available and their importance to me, hoping for a total value close to my outside offer but better for potentially concluding the negotiation early due to discount factors on further rounds.\n\nFirst, calculate my value for all items:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units at a value of 37 each = 74\n- Item 2: 6 units at a value of 49 each = 294\n- Item 3: 5 units at a value of 37 each = 185\n- Item 4: 4 units at a value of 55 each = 220\n- Item 5: 4 units at a value of 24 each = 96\n\nTotal combined value = 74 + 294 + 185 + 220 + 96 = 869\n\nNext, I will form an initial counteroffer where I keep enough value to surpass my outside offer (644) after considering the discounting effect (which doesn't apply on the first round since \\( r-1 = 0 \\) and \\( \\gamma^0 = 1 \\)).\n\nI'd like to keep strategic high-value bundles while offering enough to avoid walking from the other side. Consider:\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal for Round 1**:\nOffering Player 2:\n- 1 unit of Item 1: leaves me 1 unit = 37\n- 4 units of Item 2: leaves me 2 units = 98\n- 3 units of Item 3: leaves me 2 units = 74\n- 2 units of Item 4: leaves me 2 units = 110\n- 2 units of Item 5: leaves me 2 units = 48\n\nCalculating my retained value:\n- Value of retained Item 1 = 1 unit * 37 = 37\n- Value of retained Item 2 = 2 units * 49 = 98\n- Value of retained Item 3 = 2 units * 37 = 74\n- Value of retained Item 4 = 2 units * 55 = 110\n- Value of retained Item 5 = 2 units * 24 = 48\n\nTotal retained value = 37 + 98 + 74 + 110 + 48 = 367\n\nMy proposed offer indeed comes to a retained value less than the outside offer because with a blanket offer on the table, negotiations are on. This approach needs shifting, making sure value stays enough. I'll offer less:\n\n**New Counteroffer Proposal**:\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 1\n- Offer 2 units of Item 2\n- Offer 3 units of Item 3\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 4\n- Offer 2 units of Item 5\n\nCalculate again:\n\nRetained:\n- 1 unit of Item 1 = 37\n- 4 units of Item 2 = 196\n- 2 units of Item 3 = 74\n- 3 units of Item 4 = 165\n- 2 units of Item 5 = 48\n\nRetained value: 37 + 196 + 74 + 165 + 48 = 520 (with further adjustment in considering discount depending advancement)\n\nGiven the result falls inadequately under instead anticipate more negotiation recon adjustment. Proceed:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]}\n```\n\nThus, the adjustment struggle poignantly seek optimization following counterbalance check progress further rounds while continually adjusting negotiation efficiency thresholds.",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 865. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's start by calculating the total possible value for all items to me:\n\n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 99 value/unit = 297\n- Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 34 value/unit = 34\n- Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 59 value/unit = 295\n- Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 47 value/unit = 141\n- Item 5: 8 units \u00d7 34 value/unit = 272\n\nThe total maximal value of all items to me is 1039.\n\nMy outside offer is 865. Therefore, I must ensure that any offer I accept or propose gives me a value greater than or equal to 865.\n\nGiven the discount factor, and that this is round 1, I should aim for a value of approximately 865 or more since this the first offer and will not be discounted (gamma^0 = 1).\n\nNow, let's come up with a reasonable counteroffer that maximizes my value while still leaving a potential deal opportunity open for Player 2. It is important to leave some potential value for Player 2 to make the deal appealing.\n\nLet's calculate a few potential offers:\n\n1. **Offer [1, 1, 3, 1, 5]** (what goes to Player 2):\n\n   - For me:\n     - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 99 = 198\n     - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 34 = 0\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 59 = 118\n     - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 47 = 94\n     - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 34 = 102\n   - Total for me = 198 + 0 + 118 + 94 + 102 = 512\n\nClearly, this offer does not meet my outside offer value.\n\n2. **Offer [0, 0, 2, 0, 6]** (what goes to Player 2):\n\n   - For me:\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 99 = 297\n     - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 34 = 34\n     - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 59 = 177\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 47 = 141\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 34 = 68\n   - Total for me = 297 + 34 + 177 + 141 + 68 = 717\n\nThis offer still does not meet my threshold. Hence, let's reduce what I give away further:\n\n3. **Offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 4]** (what goes to Player 2):\n\n   - For me:\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 99 = 297\n     - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 34 = 34\n     - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 59 = 236\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 47 = 141\n     - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 34 = 136\n   - Total for me = 297 + 34 + 236 + 141 + 136 = 844\n\nThis is close, but still below what I need. Let's try again with a minimal giveaway:\n\n4. **Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]** (what goes to Player 2):\n\n   - For me:\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 99 = 297\n     - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 34 = 34\n     - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 59 = 295\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 47 = 141\n     - Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 34 = 170\n   - Total for me = 297 + 34 + 295 + 141 + 170 = 937\n\nThis offer finally achieves a value above my outside offer of 865. Therefore, I will proceed with this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

If this doesn't occur, I should walk away.\n\nLet's start with the current offer that I provided on Round 1: [0, 1, 5, 3, 4].\n\nThis means I get:\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 4\nWhich gives me a total value of:\n3 * 64 + 0 * 72 + 0 * 82 + 0 * 80 + 4 * 22 = 192 + 88 = 280\n\nHowever, if I counteroffer with the same offer of [0, 1, 5, 3, 4], the discounted value is 280 * 0.9 = 252, which is still less than my outside offer. So, I will not make this offer.\n\nLet me try offering Player 1 almost everything and see what my discounted value is. I will give Player 1 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5. This means I only get one unit of item 5.\n\nMy value:\n1 * 22 = 22\nDiscounted Value: 22 * 0.9 = 19.8. Which is significantly less than 1027, so that makes this offer terrible.\n\nInstead, I will give Player 1 only 1 unit of Item 5. So I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] to player 1.\nMy value:\n3 * 64 + 1 * 72 + 5 * 82 + 3 * 80 + 7 * 22 = 192 + 72 + 410 + 240 + 154 = 1068\nDiscounted value = 1068 * 0.9 = 961.2. Which is lower than my outside offer.\n\nI will walk away since I cannot get an acceptable discounted value in Round 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This is lower than walking away, and the value of walking away goes up due to the discount rate. I should never offer the other player all the items.\n\nLet's try to make a reasonable counteroffer that slightly favors myself. How about offering the other player the same amount of items that I did last round?\nThis was [2, 2, 0, 1, 0], which means I would keep [3, 1, 5, 4, 4] for myself.\nThe value of this is:\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 24 = 72\n*   1 units of item 2: 1 * 25 = 25\n*   5 units of item 3: 5 * 81 = 405\n*   4 units of item 4: 4 * 19 = 76\n*   4 units of item 5: 4 * 68 = 272\n*   **Total Value of this offer:** 72+25+405+76+272 = 850\nScaled down by the discount rate: 850 * 0.9 = 765\nThis is greater than the walking away option of 701, so this is what I will offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

It's critical to ensure any counteroffer I make exceeds this value.\n\nA potential fair offer could involve me taking more valuable items (according to my private values) and offering less valuable items to Player 2. Here's how I might consider dividing the items:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 (value to me = 13)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (value to me = 74)\n  - 2 units of item 3 (value to me = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94)\n  - 3 units of item 4 (value to me = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (value to me = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60)\n\nMy remaining value would be:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 13\n- 1 unit of item 2: 74\n- 2 units of item 3: 94\n- 2 units of item 4: 14\n- 2 units of item 5: 40\n- Total value = 13 + 74 + 94 + 14 + 40 = 235\n\nThis total (235) far exceeds my outside offer of 57, making it a good choice for a counteroffer.

My values for these items are 10, 69, 100, 10, and 98. My outside offer is 658.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n1 * 10 + 1 * 69 + 2 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 3 * 98 = 10 + 69 + 200 + 30 + 294 = 603\n\nThe current offer is worth 603 to me. This is less than my outside offer of 658. So, accepting the offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since it's round 1, there are two more rounds of negotiation possible. I need to decide if I can make a counteroffer that would be better than my outside offer, taking into account the discount factor. If negotiations continue to round 2, the values are discounted by 0.9. If they continue to round 3, the discount factor is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81.\n\nLet's calculate my total value of all items:\n2 * 10 + 2 * 69 + 4 * 100 + 5 * 10 + 5 * 98 = 20 + 138 + 400 + 50 + 490 = 1098\n\nTo make a profitable counteroffer, I want to get as close to my total value as possible, while giving Player 1 enough to accept. I don't know Player 1's values, so I can't be sure what they would accept.\n\nLet's consider keeping all the item 3 and item 5 for myself, because I highly value them:\nI keep 4 units of item 3 and 5 units of item 5.\nThat means player 1 would get: 2 item 1, 2 item 2, 0 item 3, 5 item 4, 0 item 5.\nThe value of this counteroffer to me would be:\n2 * 10 + 2 * 69 + 4 * 100 + 5 * 10 + 5 * 98 = 1098\n\nMy total possible value = 1098\nMy outside offer is 658.\n\nIf I keep all item 3 and 5, and give the rest to player 1:\nPlayer 1 gets [2, 2, 0, 5, 0]\nI get [0, 0, 4, 0, 5]\nMy value: 0 + 0 + 400 + 0 + 490 = 890\nThis is much better than my outside offer.\n\nThe question is what can I give to Player 1, such that he accepts in the next round, otherwise, I will get my outside offer of 658.\nI can offer [1, 1, 2, 3, 3] which Player 1 offered to me.\nMy value is 603 which is less than my outside offer.\nI should counteroffer something that will give me more than 658.\n\nLet's try another approach. I want to maximize my gain.\nI can offer [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]\nThen I have [1, 1, 2, 2, 2] for myself.\nMy value is 10 + 69 + 200 + 20 + 196 = 495\nThis is less than my outside offer.\n\nI am not confident that I can make a counteroffer that is beneficial.

The discounted value of accepting the current offer (830.7) is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n### Consider Counteroffer:\nTo make a counteroffer that could provide me more value, I need to make sure the remaining amounts left to me exceed my outside offer value of 1105 after accounting for discounts.\n\nOne way to potentially improve my position is to try to keep more of the high-value items: item 4, item 1, and item 5. Let\u2019s propose the following counteroffer to player 2, to aim for a higher valuation:\n\n- Counteroffer: [3, 2, 2, 3, 3]\n  This keeps more of item 5, which has a higher per-unit value.\n\nEvaluate the value to me:\n- Item 1: 4 * 51 = 204\n- Item 2: 4 * 37 = 148\n- Item 3: 2 * 2 = 4\n- Item 4: 4 * 83 = 332\n- Item 5: 5 * 68 = 340\n- Total value = 1028\n\nDiscounted for round 2:\n- Discounted value = 1028 * 0.9 = 925.2\n\nThis counteroffer still doesn\u2019t exceed my outside offer value of 1105 when applying the discount. However, it could increase negotiation leverage if player 2 values item 4 and 5 differently. I need to prioritize maximizing the immediate post-discount value.\n\nGiven this scenario, I need to weigh the risk of not meeting my outside offer value through these adjustments. The evaluated proposals still trail the outside offer. Retaining higher value proportions with certainty could be strategically important here.\n\nUltimately, since none of my variations of counteroffers post-discount exceed my guaranteed outside offer, and the current offer does not compete with it, I should conclude the negotiation:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This results in a value of 0 for me.\n\n2. **Outside Offer**:\n   - My outside offer is 117. This means if I WALK away from the negotiations, I will receive a guaranteed value of 117.\n\n3. **My Original Offer**:\n   - In Round 1, I offered [1, 3, 3, 1, 4]. \n   - Calculating the value I would receive from this proposal:\n     - Item 1: 0 units for me, = 0 value\n     - Item 2: 1 unit for me, 1 \u00d7 98 = 98 value\n     - Item 3: 4 units for me, 4 \u00d7 25 = 100 value\n     - Item 4: 2 units for me, 2 \u00d7 7 = 14 value\n     - Item 5: 2 units for me, 2 \u00d7 46 = 92 value\n     - Total value = 304\n\n4. **Discounted Value from Continuing Negotiations**:\n   - Given the discount rate, if I expect a similar counteroffer in future rounds, the calculation would be adjusted by gamma (0.9) to the power of (round number - 1). Therefore, round 2 calculations stay current.\n\n5. **Make a Counteroffer**:\n   - Since both my and Player 2's offer in the first round did not meet an agreement, and given Player 2's current offer is worse than my outside option, I should propose a new offer.\n   - Let's try to find a balance that provides me a value significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\n6. **Counteroffer Proposal**:\n   - Let's consider offering less of the items that are of high value to me, but enough for the other player to potentially accept. An option could be offering:\n     - Offer [0, 2, 5, 1, 3] to Player 2, keeping [1, 2, 2, 2, 3] for myself.\n   - Calculate the value for myself:\n     - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n     - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n     - Total value = 466\n\nSince offering [0, 2, 5, 1, 3] gives me a value of 466, which is significantly more than the outside offer of 117, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 5, 1, 3]}\n```",

I need to adjust by keeping more from important items.\n\nRevising the offer with more items kept from high value ones:\n- **Offer 0 of Item 1** (keep 2)\n- **Offer 2 of Item 2** (keep 3)\n- **Offer 3 of Item 3** (keep 4)\n- **Offer 3 of Item 4** (keep 3)\n- **Offer 3 of Item 5** (keep 3)\n\nRecalculate:\n- **Item 1**: 2 units \u00d7 31 value/unit = 62\n- **Item 2**: 3 units \u00d7 15 value/unit = 45\n- **Item 3**: 4 units \u00d7 67 value/unit = 268\n- **Item 4**: 3 units \u00d7 52 value/unit = 156\n- **Item 5**: 3 units \u00d7 32 value/unit = 96\n\nRe-calculated Total = 62 + 45 + 268 + 156 + 96 = 627\n\nStill less than my outside offer but better:\n\nHence, I can restructure to ensure I secure a countering position in Round 2.\n\nAdjust offer slightly again for round 2 potential:\n- 0 Item 1,\n- 1 Item 2, \n- 3 Item 3,\n- 2 Item 4,\n- 2 Item 5\n\nTotal Outcome Value Thus: \n- **Item 2**: 4 units \u00d7 15 = 60 \n- **Item 3**: 4 units \u00d7 67 = 268 \n- **Item 4**: 4 units \u00d7 52 = 208\n- **Item 5**: 4 units \u00d7 32 = 128\n- Total = 664\n\nEnsures Blunder, avg strategic risk, round 2 better fleece potential via my side retainance of deal preference.\n\n**Decision:** Since my offers don't yet meet the outside offer potential acceptability at no risk yet exists. Keep counter potential.\n\nSet offer initially:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 3, 2]}",

To make Player 1 accept my offer, the offer must provide Player 1 a value at least as good as walking away from the negotiation and taking their outside option. I do not know the private outside offer for Player 1.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 173. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 780 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine my action, I need to evaluate potential offers in terms of my total value and compare it against my outside offer value of 173. The items available are distributed as follows: 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n### My Values Per Item:\n- Item 1: 95 per unit\n- Item 2: 91 per unit\n- Item 3: 8 per unit\n- Item 4: 49 per unit\n- Item 5: 17 per unit\n\n### Available Units:\n- Item 1: 7 units\n- Item 2: 5 units\n- Item 3: 4 units\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\n### Total Value Calculation\nMy total value for all items:\n- 7 units of item 1: 7 * 95 = 665\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 * 91 = 455\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 * 8 = 32\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 49 = 98\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 * 17 = 51\n\nTotal value from all items = 665 + 455 + 32 + 98 + 51 = 1301\n\n### Strategy\nTo beat my outside offer value of 173, I need a combination of items that exceeds this value. Ideally, I will strive to keep items with a high value to me and offer those with lower value to Player 2.\n\n#### Initial Offer Strategy\nLet's aim to initially offer Player 2 the items that add least to my total value. I will try to make a reasonable offer that leaves me with enough value greater than 173 but not overly unfair:\n\n1. **Give:**\n   - Item 1: 2 units (remaining with me: 5 units)\n   - Item 2: 2 units (remaining with me: 3 units)\n   - Item 3: 4 units (remaining with me: 0 units)\n   - Item 4: 1 unit (remaining with me: 1 unit)\n   - Item 5: 2 units (remaining with me: 1 unit)\n\n2. **My Retained Value:**\n   - 5 units of item 1: 5 * 95 = 475\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 91 = 273\n   - 0 units of item 3: 0\n   - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 49 = 49\n   - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 17 = 17\n\nTotal value for me = 475 + 273 + 49 + 17 = 814\n\n### Conclusion\nWith this division, I'm securing a total value of 814 for myself, clearly exceeding my outside option of 173. I will propose this offer to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 4, 1, 2]}\n```",

However, we need to consider if a counteroffer might yield a better result, taking into account the discount factor in future rounds.\n\nLet's consider offering player 1 an equal split of the items.

If I walk my value is 190. I can also make an offer. Since there are three rounds, the discounted value of round 2 and 3 is less than the value in round 1.\n\nGiven the current offer of 287, which is greater than my outside option of 190, and the fact that it's round 1, it makes sense to accept the offer. Making a counteroffer risks the negotiation failing, resulting in my outside option. While theoretically I could squeeze out more value with optimal bargaining, the complexity of modeling the other agent's behavior outweighs the potential gains in this simplified scenario.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

My values for these items are 41, 18, 66, 1, and 43. My outside offer is 769.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n* Item 1: 2 units * 41 = 82\n* Item 2: 2 units * 18 = 36\n* Item 3: 2 units * 66 = 132\n* Item 4: 2 units * 1 = 2\n* Item 5: 0 units * 43 = 0\nTotal value of the offer = 82 + 36 + 132 + 2 + 0 = 252\n\nThis value (252) is significantly lower than my outside offer of 769. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. My goal is to get a deal that's worth more than 769 to me, taking into account the discount factor in later rounds. Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.0.\n\nI want to keep as much of item 3 as possible, as it has the highest value for me.\nLet's consider keeping all the items for myself:\n* Item 1: 7 units * 41 = 287\n* Item 2: 4 units * 18 = 72\n* Item 3: 7 units * 66 = 462\n* Item 4: 3 units * 1 = 3\n* Item 5: 1 units * 43 = 43\nTotal value: 287 + 72 + 462 + 3 + 43 = 867\n\nNow, let's construct a counteroffer that gives player 1 enough value to be acceptable to them while maximizing my own value. Suppose I offer them [4, 2, 4, 1, 1]. This means I keep:\n* Item 1: 7 - 4 = 3 units * 41 = 123\n* Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units * 18 = 36\n* Item 3: 7 - 4 = 3 units * 66 = 198\n* Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units * 1 = 2\n* Item 5: 1 - 1 = 0 units * 43 = 0\nTotal value to me: 123 + 36 + 198 + 2 + 0 = 359\n\nThis is still way less than my outside offer. Let's offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Meaning I keep all the items.\n\nIn this case, the total value is 867. Since this is better than the outside offer, let's suggest a counteroffer to get this and see what Player 1 does.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

My outside offer is 769, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n*   2 units of item 1: 2 * 41 = 82\n*   2 units of item 2: 2 * 18 = 36\n*   2 units of item 3: 2 * 66 = 132\n*   2 units of item 4: 2 * 1 = 2\n*   0 units of item 5: 0 * 43 = 0\nTotal value of the offer: 82 + 36 + 132 + 2 + 0 = 252\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor since it is round 2.\nDiscounted value of offer = 252 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 252 * 0.9 = 226.8\n\nSince my outside option is 769 and the discounted value of Player 1's offer is 226.8, it's significantly better to pursue my outside option unless I can make a counteroffer that is more beneficial and will be accepted by Player 1.\n\nNow let's figure out my maximum possible value. I have:\n* 7 units of item 1 * 41 = 287\n* 4 units of item 2 * 18 = 72\n* 7 units of item 3 * 66 = 462\n* 3 units of item 4 * 1 = 3\n* 1 units of item 5 * 43 = 43\nTotal value = 867\n\nSince I have the last move, and any counteroffer in round 3 is treated as a walk, I want to offer player 1 an amount that gives me at least 769 in value. That means I can give them at most 867 - 769 = 98 worth of value at my own valuation.\n\nGiven that it's the final round (effectively) and I want to maximize my outcome, I should make a counteroffer that gives me at least my outside option. Given that the current offer is only worth 226.8 to me, I'll make a counteroffer that leaves me with a value greater than or equal to 769. Since it is round 2, this will result in a value to me of 769 * 0.9 = 692.1 if Player 1 accepts my counteroffer. This is clearly better than the current offer. Since Player 1 does not know my outside offer, it is still worthwhile to offer Player 1 something. I will calculate an offer that leaves me with slightly more than 769 and hope that player 1 accepts.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer where I keep almost everything. Let's offer player 1 1 unit of item 4.\nValue to Player 1 = 1 (their value).\nThis leaves me with:\n7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5. This has a value to me of 287 + 72 + 462 + 2 + 43 = 866\n\nI will offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

My private values are 10, 35, 59, 94, and 17 respectively.\n\nValue of current offer:\n(0 * 10) + (1 * 35) + (0 * 59) + (1 * 94) + (1 * 17) = 0 + 35 + 0 + 94 + 17 = 146\n\nSince this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nDiscounted value of current offer: 146 * 0.9 = 131.4\n\nMy outside offer value is 411. Since 131.4 < 411, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. It's the second round, so I have one more chance. To make a counteroffer worthwhile, it needs to be better than my outside offer value when discounted to the current round. I have:\n1 unit of item 1, value 10\n3 units of item 2, value 35 each\n2 units of item 3, value 59 each\n3 units of item 4, value 94 each\n5 units of item 5, value 17 each\nTotal value: 10 + (3*35) + (2*59) + (3*94) + (5*17) = 10 + 105 + 118 + 282 + 85 = 600\n\nIf I offer player 1 nothing, I keep everything, giving me a value of 600, which discounted is 600 * 0.9 = 540. Since 540 > 411, this outcome is preferable to my walkaway value.\n\nI'll try to get a better offer for myself. I'll start by offering a relatively small amount to Player 1. Let's consider offering Player 1 one unit of item 5, the item I value least. This offer would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], I would keep 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. The value to me is:\n(1*10) + (3*35) + (2*59) + (3*94) + (4*17) = 10 + 105 + 118 + 282 + 68 = 583\nDiscounted, that becomes 583 * 0.9 = 524.7.

                    "response": "To make a decision, I must ensure that the counteroffer I create has a total value to me greater than my outside offer of 1394. Let me calculate the total possible value of all items to me and then create a counteroffer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of all items:\n\n- Item 1: 7 units \u00d7 51 = 357\n- Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 67 = 268\n- Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 40 = 200\n- Item 4: 7 units \u00d7 57 = 399\n- Item 5: 8 units \u00d7 65 = 520\n\nTotal possible value for all items = 357 + 268 + 200 + 399 + 520 = 1744\n\nMy decision is also influenced by my alternative option, namely my outside offer of 1394. My goal is to maximize my value above this alternative. Given the discount rate and my outside offer, I want to propose a distribution that offers me a value greater than 1394.\n\nLet's assume a distribution where I optimize for my more highly valued items but still offer a reasonable portion to the other player. This means I retain higher quantities of items with a higher per-unit value to me.\n\nLet's consider the following initial distribution, ensuring my value exceeds 1394:\n\n- Offer Player 2: \n  - Item 1: 2 units (I keep 5)\n  - Item 2: 1 unit (I keep 3)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (I keep 3)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (I keep 5)\n  - Item 5: 3 units (I keep 5)\n\nNow, calculate the value of what I keep:\n\n- My value from Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 51 = 255\n- My value from Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 67 = 201\n- My value from Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 40 = 120\n- My value from Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 57 = 285\n- My value from Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 65 = 325\n\nTotal value I keep = 255 + 201 + 120 + 285 + 325 = 1186\n\nSince my total value of 1186 from this distribution is less than my outside offer of 1394, I need to revise my proposal to retain more high-value items.\n\nSo, I'll revise my initial offer and calculate again, retaining more items, especially those with higher value per unit:\n\nNew Offer Proposal (for Player 2):\n- Item 1: 4 units (I keep 3)\n- Item 2: 1 unit (I keep 3)\n- Item 3: 3 units (I keep 2)\n- Item 4: 3 units (I keep 4)\n- Item 5: 4 units (I keep 4)\n\nCalculate value for me:\n- My value from Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 51 = 153\n- My value from Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 67 = 201\n- My value from Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 40 = 80\n- My value from Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 57 = 228\n- My value from Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 65 = 260\n\nTotal value I keep = 153 + 201 + 80 + 228 + 260 = 922\n\nThis approach is not effective since it's still far from 1394. I clearly need to retain the majority of high-value items to exceed the outside offer.\n\nLet's optimize further:\n\nFinal Offer Proposal:\n- Offer Player 2: [3, 1, 4, 2, 4] (I keep [4, 3, 1, 5, 4])\n\nCalculate value for me:\n- My value from Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 51 = 204\n- My value from Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 67 = 201\n- My value from Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 40 = 40\n- My value from Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 57 = 285\n- My value from Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 65 = 260\n\nTotal value I keep = 204 + 201 + 40 + 285 + 260 = 990 (still not above my outside offer)\n\nSince it's proving difficult to meet my offer constraint and improving from the drastic difference, and acknowledging that making counteroffers is challenging at such constraint, strategically I should choose to walk.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer [1, 1, 2, 1, 3] to determine its value to me.

The discounted value of the current offer is 486 * 0.9 = 437.4\n\nMy outside offer is 651.  Since 437.4 < 651, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to decide what to offer Player 1. My goal is to maximize my own value, but I also need to make the offer attractive enough for Player 1 to accept it. Let's consider a fair split, where each player receives a value that makes them at least as happy as their walk away values.\n\nI have the following items: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n\nPlayer 1's current offer is [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]. That means I get [1, 2, 3, 2, 2].\nMy values are 31, 54, 11, 88, 97. So I get 31 + 108 + 33 + 176 + 194 = 542.\nWith discount 0.9, that is 542*0.9 = 487.8, which is < 651.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 half of each item:\n\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 1.5 -> 1 or 2 (try both)\n*   Item 3: 2.5 -> 2 or 3 (try both)\n*   Item 4: 1.5 -> 1 or 2 (try both)\n*   Item 5: 2.5 -> 2 or 3 (try both)\n\nI will begin by offering Player 1: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2] and then calculate my worth from the remaining items.\n\nI would receive: 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5. This is valued at 31 + 108 + 33 + 176 + 291 = 639.\nDiscounted, this is 639 * 0.9 = 575.1, still less than 651.\n\nLet's offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and keep everything for myself. This means I get: 2 * 31 + 3 * 54 + 5 * 11 + 3 * 88 + 5 * 97 = 62 + 162 + 55 + 264 + 485 = 1028. 1028 * 0.9 = 925.2 which is way more than 651.

Let's propose giving Player 1 the following:\n* Item 1: 2 units\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 4 units\n* Item 2: 3 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 4 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nThe value of this division to me is:\n(4 * 11) + (3 * 63) + (2 * 18) + (4 * 16) + (2 * 34) = 44 + 189 + 36 + 64 + 68 = 401\n\nSince 401 is greater than my outside option of 329, this looks like a worthwhile counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

Thus, I want to make sure any counteroffer I make is better than my outside option when discounted. Let's think about possible good counteroffers. I want to get as much of Item 2 as possible.\n\nLet's consider offering player 1 half of the items. So: [3, 2, 2, 3, 1].

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine my best action.\n\nThe current offer gives me [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1, which means I receive:\n- Item 1: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n- Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n- Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n- Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n- Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n\nMy value for this outcome is:\n- Item 1: 5 * 37 = 185\n- Item 2: 4 * 82 = 328\n- Item 3: 2 * 68 = 136\n- Item 4: 1 * 90 = 90\n- Item 5: 2 * 21 = 42\nTotal value = 185 + 328 + 136 + 90 + 42 = 781\n\nSince this is round 1, there is no discount factor yet (gamma^0 = 1). Therefore, the value of accepting this offer is 781.\n\nMy outside offer is 295. Since 781 > 295, accepting the offer is better than walking away right now.\n\nHowever, before accepting, I should consider if I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer. In round 2, the discount factor will be 0.9, and in round 3 it will be 0.81.\n\nLet's think about a potential counteroffer. I want to give Player 1 just enough to make them accept, but not more. I don't know Player 1's values, so this is tricky. Since item 4 has the highest value for me (90), and item 5 has the lowest (21), it makes sense to give away item 5 before item 4.\n\nA simple counteroffer would be to give back what I am currently being offered. Player 1 offered me [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], so a counteroffer would be for me to offer them [1, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\nIf I make them a counteroffer of [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], my payoffs would be 781 as calculated above. This would only be worth considering if I thought the original proposal was a bluff, and a counter offer would increase the other agent's payoff.\n\nGiven the limited number of rounds, the discount factor, and my current payoff being much greater than my outside option, it seems like the best thing is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Given that the negotiation proceeds for up to three rounds with a discount factor of \\(0.9\\), and my retained value is already considerably lower than my outside offer, any offer must surpass the threshold of 1639 in present value terms.\n\nThus, I will propose a more aggressive counteroffer:\n\n### Revised Offer Strategy\n\n1. **Retain 0 units of Item 1**: Offer 4\n2. **Retain 4 units of Item 2**: Offer 6\n3. **Retain 3 units of Item 3**: Offer 3\n4. **Retain 0 units of Item 4**: Offer 1\n5. **Retain 3 units of Item 5**: Offer 2 \n   \n**Offer to Player 2 Revised**: \\([4, 6, 3, 1, 2]\\)\n\n**Revised Retained Value Calculation**:\n- 0 units of Item 1: \\(0 \\times 100 = 0\\)\n- 4 units of Item 2: \\(4 \\times 75 = 300\\)\n- 3 units of Item 3: \\(3 \\times 45 = 135\\)\n- 0 units of Item 4: \\(0 \\times 88 = 0\\)\n- 3 units of Item 5: \\(3 \\times 63 = 189\\)\n\n**Revised Retained Total Value**: \n0 + 300 + 135 + 0 + 189 = 624\n\nThe new offer is still significantly below 1639, which means economically walking away is currently the optimal strategy to secure 1639 since even with future negotiations and discounting, it holds assured value that current offers cannot compete with.\n\n### Decision\nTherefore, I must evaluate the risk of proceeding further and find no configuration that exceeds my outside offer value, especially when future round discounting further erodes potential gains compared to the secured outside offer.\n\nThus, my optimal decision is to:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I should ask for more.\n\nOkay, so it seems like getting more than my outside offer would mean taking nearly everything. Let's try offering Player 1 very little. How about this: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]?\n\nThen I get:\n*   Item 1: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n*   Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n*   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n*   Item 4: 7 - 1 = 6 units\n*   Item 5: 6 - 1 = 5 units\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n*   Item 1: 5 * 91 = 455\n*   Item 2: 3 * 26 = 78\n*   Item 3: 2 * 18 = 36\n*   Item 4: 6 * 96 = 576\n*   Item 5: 5 * 48 = 240\n\nTotal: 455 + 78 + 36 + 576 + 240 = 1385\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 31. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 330 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 0, 2, 2]. This means they want the remaining items. I need to calculate the value of this offer to me.\n\nMy values are: item 1: 91, item 2: 26, item 3: 18, item 4: 96, item 5: 48.\n\nThe offer gives me:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 91 = 182\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 26 = 26\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 * 18 = 0\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 96 = 192\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 48 = 96\n\nTotal value of the offer to me: 182 + 26 + 0 + 192 + 96 = 496\n\nNow, I need to discount this value by gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nDiscounted value of the offer: 496 * 0.9 = 446.4\n\nMy outside offer is 1075. Since 446.4 is significantly less than 1075, accepting the offer is not a good idea.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 1 something that they might accept, but that still gives me a value greater than 1075 / 0.9 = 1194.44 (since I'll be discounting my value in round 3 if we get there). Let's aim to get a value of at least 1200 for myself.\n\nTotal items: 6 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\n\nTo get a high value, I want to keep as much of item 4 as possible (value 96) and item 1 (value 91).\n\nLet's try offering Player 1: [4, 2, 1, 5, 4]. This leaves me with:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 91 = 182\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 26 = 26\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 18 = 18\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 96 = 192\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 48 = 96\nTotal value for me: 182 + 26 + 18 + 192 + 96 = 514\nDiscounted in round 3: 514 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 416.34. This is much lower than my outside offer, therefore is not a good offer.\n\nLet's aim for a counteroffer that is at least equal to my outside option. Say I offered Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This results in 6 * 91 + 3 * 26 + 2 * 18 + 7 * 96 + 6 * 48 = 546 + 78 + 36 + 672 + 288 = 1620. The discounted value of this if we get to round 3 is 1620 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 1312.2, which is more than my outside option.\n\nHow about I offer Player 1 only the items I value the least. I could offer Player 1: [3, 2, 2, 4, 3], which would leave me with [3, 1, 0, 3, 3]. That's 3 * 91 + 1 * 26 + 0 * 18 + 3 * 96 + 3 * 48 = 273 + 26 + 0 + 288 + 144 = 731. 731 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 592.11, which is less than my outside option.\n\nSince it's round 2 and I need a value greater than 1075/0.9 = 1194.44, let's calculate the total value to me of all items: 6*91 + 3*26 + 2*18 + 7*96 + 6*48 = 546 + 78 + 36 + 672 + 288 = 1620.\n\nI want to keep more for myself and offer less to player 1. Let's try offering [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. This offer leaves me with [5, 3, 2, 6, 5]. So, 5*91 + 3*26 + 2*18 + 6*96 + 5*48 = 455 + 78 + 36 + 576 + 240 = 1385. This multiplied by 0.9 * 0.9 is 1121.85, which is lower than 1194.44.\n\nGiven the discount factor and the need to get a high value if this goes to round 3, I'll offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Given my high values on items 3, 4, and 5, I'll try to keep more of these items for myself.\n\nLet's consider leaving Player 2 with a modest portion of items to assess my resulting value.\n\n**Proposal:**\n- Offer Player 2: \n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 1 unit\n  - Item 3: 1 unit\n  - Item 4: 2 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n  \n**My Remaining Units:**\n- Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 19 = 95\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 38 = 76\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 80 = 320\n- Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 82 = 410\n- Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 53 = 265\n\nTotal value from the remaining units: 95 + 76 + 320 + 410 + 265 = 1166\n\n1166 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 26, ensuring that this offer maximizes my value.

My values for these items are 82, 18, 14, 37, and 71, respectively. My outside offer is 929. I need to determine if accepting the offer is better than walking away and receiving my outside offer.\n\nIf I accept the offer, my total value would be:\n\n(3 * 82) + (1 * 18) + (1 * 14) + (2 * 37) + (1 * 71) = 246 + 18 + 14 + 74 + 71 = 423\n\nSince 423 is significantly less than my outside offer of 929, accepting is a bad idea.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. Since it's only round 1, there's still a chance to negotiate a better deal. Walking away guarantees me 929, but a good counteroffer could potentially yield a higher value.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer where I receive most of the items. To do that, I must give Player 1 a small amount of each item. Let's try an offer where I give player 1 [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]. In this case, my total value will be calculated based on what I keep, which is [7, 3, 5, 6, 6].\n\nMy value would be:\n\n(7 * 82) + (3 * 18) + (5 * 14) + (6 * 37) + (6 * 71) = 574 + 54 + 70 + 222 + 426 = 1346\n\nIf the player 1 accepts my offer, the value of my outcome will be 1346, which is greater than my outside offer.
