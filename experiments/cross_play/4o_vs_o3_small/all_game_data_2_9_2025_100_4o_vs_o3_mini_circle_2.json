Hence, the current offer value of 44.1 (after applying the discount factor) is lower than my outside offer of 71.\n\n### Counteroffer Consideration\nTo propose a counteroffer, it should be structured to exceed my outside value of 71 after applying the discount factor of 0.9.\n\nPossible counteroffer:\n- Keep all items: [0,0,0,0,0] (worth 131 without discount, 117.9 with discount)\n- But this isn't likely to be accepted by Player 2 immediately.\n- Aim for a balanced distribution: Give minimal away in order to improve total value over 71 after discount. \n\nI decide:\n- Offer Player 2: [1, 0, 3, 2, 2]\nWhich leaves for me:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- 1 of item 2: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 1 of item 3: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 4 of item 4: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n- 4 of item 5: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n\nResulting in a total value of:\n\\[ 7 + 3 + 9 + 12 + 40 = 71 \\]\nApplying the discount: \n\\[ 71 \\times 0.9 = 63.9 \\]\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

With a discount factor of 0.9 in round 2, the present value is 38\u00d70.9 = 34.2, which is below my outside offer of 35.\n3. Therefore, I need to counter so that if the deal is accepted the discounted value exceeds 35. Adjusting for discount, I require a raw value of at least 35/0.9 \u2248 38.9.\n4.

One candidate counteroffer I considered is to give Player 1:\n\u2003\u2003x1 = 2, x2 = 0, x3 = 1, x4 = 3, x5 = 0.\nLet\u2019s check the \u201ccost\u201d of this bundle from my view:\n\u2003\u20033\u00d72 + 5\u00d70 + 4\u00d71 + 2\u00d73 + 6\u00d70 = 6 + 0 + 4 + 6 + 0 = 16.\nThen my retained items are:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5\u20132 = 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3\u20130 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2\u20131 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3\u20133 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2\u20130 = 2.\nMy value becomes:\n\u2003\u2003(3\u00d73) + (3\u00d75) + (1\u00d74) + (0\u00d72) + (2\u00d76)\n\u2003\u2003= 9 + 15 + 4 + 0 + 12 = 40,\nwhich is clearly above my outside offer of 35.\nAlso, by conceding all of item 4 (which is low value to me) and some quantities of items 1 and 3, I leave Player 1 with [2, 0, 1, 3, 0]. While I cannot know his private values, this concession may appeal to him without me giving away too much.\n\n6. Since 40 > 35 and this counteroffer improves my outcome while offering a plausible bundle to Player 1, I choose to make it.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2,0,1,3,0]}",

I can try to obtain these 4 extra points by keeping one more unit of an item relative to what Player 1 originally expected. Choosing the item wisely matters.

Therefore, this offer is not acceptable.\n\nSince I need to counter with a more favorable offer, or risk WALKing away, let's try offering less of high-value items again while ensuring my resultant value exceeds 144.\n\nTry a more conservative offer:\n- Offer 0 units of item 1, keeping 4.\n- Offer 0 units of item 2, keeping 3.\n- Offer 2 units of item 3, keeping 5.\n- Offer 0 units of item 4, keeping 4.\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5, keeping 1.\n\nCalculate the value:\n\n- Value from item 1: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n- Value from item 2: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n- Value from item 3: 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n- Value from item 4: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n- Value from item 5: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n\nTotal value = 32 + 27 + 30 + 28 + 8 = 125\n\nThis approach still does not reach the necessary 144 total value. More items should be kept or a different strategy adopted.\n\nAttempt:\n- Offer 0 units of item 1, keeping 4.\n- Offer 0 units of item 2, keeping 3.\n- Offer 1 unit of item 3, keeping 6.\n- Offer 0 units of item 4, keeping 4.\n- Offer 0 units of item 5, keeping 2.\n\nCalculate value again:\n\n- Value from item 1: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n- Value from item 2: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n- Value from item 3: 6 \u00d7 6 = 36\n- Value from item 4: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n- Value from item 5: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n\nTotal value = 32 + 27 + 36 + 28 + 16 = 139\n\nSince this offer still remains under 144, it's still insufficient. After several attempts to craft an offer exceeding 144, let's consider rationalizing the risk of WALK, since minimal favorable scenarios might imply player 2's outside offer incentivizes an easier end to negotiation at better than my current counter offer try.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nTo mitigate protracted negotiation or unfavorable max offers, I realize potentially the least risk with prior unseen offers imminent might rationalize concluding with WALK, aligning better relatively near value. I will walk away from negotiations to ensure my outside offer of 144 captures optimum expected outcome relative to my current value strategies.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By ensuring potentially high value throwbacks (items 1 and 5), mutual interests are kept active.\n\nA potential counteroffer, therefore revises to maximize mine against minimum safe trade:\n- Following the strategic hold items: Adjusted offer consideration to enhance:\n    - Item 2 stands favorable spotlight in my control over other Player shares.\n\nRevise retries:\n- **Item 1**: 2 offered\n- **Item 2**: 4 offered\n- **Item 3**: 3 offered\n- **Item 4**: 5 offered\n- **Item 5**: 1 offered\n\nLet's reassess our adjustment strategy confirming better interpersonal compromise opens harder accessed doors ensuring that while marginal concessions it feeds our need more advantageously, leveraging away our least and value bits while accommodating our substantial, aligned with adjusted player's shifted flexibility. \nThusly:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 3, 2, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

That would mean I keep:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3 units, item 2: 5 units, item 3: 6 units, item 4: 3 units, item 5: 2 units.\n\u2003\u2003My value would then be: 3\u00d79 + 5\u00d75 + 6\u00d76 + 3\u00d75 + 2\u00d73 = 27 + 25 + 36 + 15 + 6 = 109.\n\u2003\u2003However, this gives Player 1 only 2 units of item 1.\n\u2022\u2003Alternatively, offering a little less demanding split such as X = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] gives:\n\u2003\u2003My kept share: [4, 4, 6, 3, 2].\n\u2003\u2003My value then is: 4\u00d79 + 4\u00d75 + 6\u00d76 + 3\u00d75 + 2\u00d73 = 36 + 20 + 36 + 15 + 6 = 113,\n\u2003\u2003which exceeds my outside option.\n\u2022\u2003This counteroffer (giving Player 1 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2) provides me a gain above 109 while likely being more palatable for Player 1 than a harsher demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 My Action:\nI will propose the counteroffer: giving Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}",

This makes the current offer unappealing.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Making a Counteroffer\nTo attempt maximizing my value, I should present a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 110 after the discount factor for round 2.\n\nLet's consider offering:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 0 units\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 1 unit\n- Item 5: 2 units \n\nThis means I would receive:\n- 5 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nCalculating the value for me:\n1. \\(5 \\times 8 = 40\\)\n2. \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\)\n3. \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\)\n4. \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\)\n5. \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\)\n\nTotal value = \\(40 + 20 + 14 + 16 + 6 = 96\\)\n\nDiscounted value = \\(96 \\times 0.9 = 86.4\\)\n\nWhile this is below my outside offer post-discount, I'm aiming to see if a more favorable negotiation is possible while giving me significant control over high-value items.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince I cannot achieve the value greater than 110 after discounting and considering rounds, I will walk away. The counteroffer calculations helped to ensure no viable offer would be above 110 given the current items distribution and rounds consideration.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

It seems also worse compared to what I've offered initially.\n\n### Potential Counteroffer:\nTo make a useful counteroffer, its value after discount must exceed my outside offer. However, counteroffers must also be considered strategically, without knowing Player 2's exact valuations. \n\nLet\u2019s consider offering [2, 2, 1, 3, 1] and evaluate:\n- Keeping 3 units of item 1 = \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\)\n- Keeping 3 units of item 2 = \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\)\n- Keeping 3 units of item 3 = \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n- Keeping 4 units of item 4 = \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\)\n- Keeping 1 unit of item 5 = \\(1 \\times 7 = 7\\)\n\nEvaluating the counteroffer:\n\\[ 30 + 21 + 9 + 20 + 7 = 87\\]\n\nDiscounting for round 2:\n\\[ 87 \\times 0.9 = 78.3\\]\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer. Considering strategic balance and unclear valuations for Player 2, other options might still not ensure anything better than my outside offer. \n\nThus, I will walk away, as any counteroffer generates a lower or similar discounted value compared to my guaranteed outside offer of 109.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Begin with giving Player 2:\n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2 (3 x 6 = 18)\n     - 1 unit of item 3 (1 x 4 = 4)\n     - 0 units of item 4 (0 x 10 = 0)\n     - 2 units of item 5 (2 x 8 = 16)\n\n   This leaves me with:\n   - 2 units of item 1 valued at 20\n   - 6 units of item 2 valued at 36\n   - 1 unit of item 3 valued at 4\n   - 0 units of item 4 valued at 0\n   - 3 units of item 5 valued at 24\n\n3. **Total retained value:**\n   - \\(20 + 36 + 4 + 0 + 24 = 84\\)\n\nThis is slightly below my outside offer, but considering negotiation flexibility, the marginal difference (2 units) might be useful for counteroffers and maintaining goodwill. \n\nTherefore, my initial offer will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

Calculating this:\n\n1. **Item 1**: 2 units \u00d7 4 (value per unit) = 8\n2. **Item 2**: 5 units \u00d7 4 (value per unit) = 20\n3. **Item 3**: 1 unit \u00d7 4 (value per unit) = 4\n4. **Item 4**: 5 units \u00d7 3 (value per unit) = 15\n5. **Item 5**: 0 units \u00d7 1 (value per unit) = 0\n\n**Total Value of my Allocation**: 8 + 20 + 4 + 15 + 0 = 47\n\n### Discounted Value with Counteroffer\nDiscounted value = 47 \u00d7 0.9 = 42.3, which is greater than my outside offer of 41.\n\n### Conclusion\nOffering this counteroffer would give me a better outcome than my outside offer, given the discount factor. Therefore, I'll proceed with this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 3, 3]}\n```",

In round 2 the discount factor is 0.9 so my present\u2010value becomes 52\u00d70.9 = 46.8 which is much below my outside offer of 104.\n\n2. In formulating a counteroffer I must guarantee that my eventual share (before discount) is such that after applying the discount (0.9) I get at least my outside offer. Namely, I need:\n\u2003\u2003\u03b3^(2\u20131)\u00d7(my deal value) = 0.9\u00d7V \u2265 104\u2003\u27f9\u2003V \u2265 104/0.9 \u2248 115.56.\nFor safety I want my share\u2019s total (using my private per\u2010unit values) to be around 116 or more. (I later refine to get around 120.)\n\n3. My total full value (if I took every unit) is:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 4\u00d73 = 12, Item2: 7\u00d78 = 56, Item3: 1\u00d79 = 9, Item4: 8\u00d79 = 72, Item5: 3\u00d71 = 3.\n\u2003\u2003Sum = 152.\nIf I denote by xi the units I give to Player 1 per item, then my share is [4 \u2013 x1, 7 \u2013 x2, 1 \u2013 x3, 8 \u2013 x4, 3 \u2013 x5] with value:\n\u2003\u20033(4 \u2013 x1) + 8(7 \u2013 x2) + 9(1 \u2013 x3) + 9(8 \u2013 x4) + 1(3 \u2013 x5) = 152 \u2013 [3x1 + 8x2 + 9x3 + 9x4 + x5].\nI want my resulting value to be at least roughly 116 (or even 120 for a little cushion). Choosing a target of 120 pre\u2013discount gives me a margin. That means the weighted sum of the items I concede must be at most 152 \u2013 120 = 32; i.e.\n\u2003\u20033x1 + 8x2 + 9x3 + 9x4 + x5 \u2264 32.\nI also want to \u201cspice\u201d the offer so that Player 1 gets items that he might value highly. (My own values make item2 and item4 very valuable to me, so I try to keep most of those; on the other hand I can concede the items that are less \u201cprecious\u201d to me.)\n\n4. One balanced counteroffer uses these concessions:\n\u2003\u2003Give Player 1:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item1: x1 = 4 (all 4 units, costing 3\u00d74 = 12)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item2: x2 = 1 (1 unit, costing 8\u00d71 = 8)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item3: x3 = 0 (keep the only unit because it is very valuable at 9)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item4: x4 = 1 (concede 1 unit, costing 9)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item5: x5 = 3 (all 3 units, costing 1\u00d73 = 3)\nThe total \u201ccost\u201d to me is 12 + 8 + 0 + 9 + 3 = 32.\nThen my remaining share becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 4 \u2013 4 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 7 \u2013 1 = 6,\n\u2003\u2003Item3: 1 \u2013 0 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003Item4: 8 \u2013 1 = 7,\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 3 \u2013 3 = 0.\nMy total value = 0\u00d73 + 6\u00d78 + 1\u00d79 + 7\u00d79 + 0\u00d71 = 48 + 9 + 63 = 120.\nUnder the discount factor (0.9), the present value is 120\u00d70.9 = 108. This meets my benchmark (it is above my outside offer of 104) while offering Player 1 a division that concedes all of my low\u2013value items (item1 and item5) and a small portion of one unit from one high\u2013value item (item4) plus 1 unit of item2. (Though I don\u2019t know Player 1\u2019s private values, this offer is more generous than the current offer I received and gives up some items likely to be attractive to them.)\n\n5.

I receive:\n- Item 1: 4 units (4 * 4) = 16\n- Item 2: 1 unit (1 * 4) = 4\n- Item 3: 0 units (0 * 4) = 0\n- Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 3) = 3\n- Item 5: 3 units (3 * 1) = 3\n- Total value to me = 16 + 4 + 0 + 3 + 3 = 26\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Discount Factor\n\nIt is round 3, so the discount factor is gamma^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81. Therefore, the present value of the current offer to me is 26 * 0.81 = 21.06.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Against the Outside Offer\n\nMy outside offer value is 41. Since 21.06 is significantly less than my outside offer value of 41, accepting the current offer is not advisable.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Counteroffer Options\n\nTo find an acceptable counteroffer, the present value must be greater than my outside offer value of 41, considering the discount factor:\n\n- Total value needed = 41 / 0.81 \u2248 50.62 (unrounded)\n\nI need a combination of item allocations where my total value exceeds 50.62. \n\nBased on the original totals:\n- Item 1: 4 units, Value per unit = 4\n- Item 2: 7 units, Value per unit = 4\n- Item 3: 1 unit, Value per unit = 4\n- Item 4: 8 units, Value per unit = 3\n- Item 5: 3 units, Value per unit = 1\n\nI maximize my outcome with:\n- Item 1: Keep 3 (value = 3 * 4 = 12) \n- Item 2: Keep 5 (value = 5 * 4 = 20)\n- Item 3: Keep 1 (value = 1 * 4 = 4)\n- Item 4: Keep 5 (value = 5 * 3 = 15)\n- Item 5: Keep 0 (value = 0 * 1 = 0)\n\nThus, offering Player 2 this counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (4 - 3)\n- Item 2: 2 units (7 - 5)\n- Item 3: 0 units (1 - 1)\n- Item 4: 3 units (8 - 5)\n- Item 5: 3 units (3 - 0)\n\nTotal value to me = 12 + 20 + 4 + 15 + 0 = 51\n51 * 0.81 = 41.31, which is slightly above my outside offer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMake the following counteroffer to exceed the outside offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 3, 3]}\n```",

In our game the totals are: item1 = 6, item2 = 4, item3 = 4, item4 = 3, and item5 = 4.\n\nRemember that my own total maximum (if I got everything) would be 6\u00d73 + 4\u00d75 + 4\u00d72 + 3\u00d71 + 4\u00d73 = 18+20+8+3+12 = 61.

My outside offer guarantees me 46.\n3. The current offer from Player 1 gives me [2, 0, 3, 1, 0]. Its value for me is:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d78 + 0\u00d77 + 3\u00d74 + 1\u00d75 + 0\u00d76 = 16 + 0 + 12 + 5 = 33,\n\u2003\u2003which is well below my outside offer.\n4. Since I must do better than 46, I want to design a counteroffer that leaves me a bundle whose total value is at least 46.\n5. In this negotiation framework I propose a division by \u201coffering\u201d a bundle to Player 1; I would then receive the remainder from the total available items. The full items available are: [7, 1, 6, 3, 1].\n6. Notice that if I were to offer Player 1 exactly the bundle he originally \u201ckept\u201d (which is the complement of his offer to me) \u2013 that is, [5, 1, 3, 2, 1] \u2013 then I would be left with [2, 0, 3, 1, 0], which is only 33 in my value (too low).\n7. To improve my outcome, I need to \u201cshift\u201d some of the high\u2010value items to myself. I value item1 (worth 8 per unit) highly, so I want to keep more of it.\n8. A natural idea is to propose a division that is \u201cclose\u201d to what Player 1 originally planned for himself but gives me more of the high\u2010value items. For example, if I offer Player 1 [3, 1, 3, 2, 1] then my allotment becomes:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 7\u20133 = 4,\n\u2003\u2003item2: 1\u20131 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003item3: 6\u20133 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003item4: 3\u20132 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003item5: 1\u20131 = 0.\n9. My value from that bundle is:\n\u2003\u20034\u00d78 + 0\u00d77 + 3\u00d74 + 1\u00d75 + 0\u00d76 = 32 + 0 + 12 + 5 = 49,\n\u2003\u2003which is above my outside offer.\n10. The offer [3, 1, 3, 2, 1] is only slightly less attractive for Player 1 compared to what he originally arranged for himself ([5,1,3,2,1]), and gives Player 1 nearly the same items in types where he might be less \u201cgreedy\u201d (accepting a loss of 2 units of item1 might be tolerable if his outside offer is not very high).\n11.

I also need to keep in mind the potential value of the deal to Player 2, as that affects their willingness to accept an offer.\n\nLet's consider an initial offer that minimizes the units I give away, ensuring I still achieve a value higher than my outside offer:\n\n1. **Possible Offers and their Values**:\n\n   - Give 1 unit of each item to Player 2, keeping the rest for myself:\n     - Items kept: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n     - My value:\n       - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 7 = 28\n       - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 3 = 12\n       - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 2 = 8\n       - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 5 = 15\n       - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n       - Total value to me: 28 + 12 + 8 + 15 + 6 = 69\n\n   - Give 2 units of each item to Player 2, keeping the rest for myself:\n     - Items kept: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n     - My value:\n       - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 7 = 21\n       - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 3 = 9\n       - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n       - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 5 = 10\n       - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4\n       - Total value to me: 21 + 9 + 6 + 10 + 4 = 50\n\nBoth of these counteroffers result in values that are well above my outside offer of 23. However, the first offer's value of 69 is relatively high to ensure acceptance by Player 2, suggesting that the second offer might be a better balance between achieving a higher value than my outside offer and maintaining fairness to encourage acceptance from Player 2.\n\nConsidering this, I'll propose the offer where Player 2 receives 2 units each of every item, as this also maintains some balance in distribution without revealing preferences or values.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer**:\n- I give Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\nHere's the counteroffer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "I first check what accepting Player 1\u2019s offer would net me. The offer on the table is [2,2,2,2,2] for me. That means I get exactly that many units of each item, and Player 1 gets the remainder. My total value if I accept is:\n\n\u2022 Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4  \n\u2022 Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20  \n\u2022 Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18  \n\u2022 Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4  \n\u2022 Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20  \n\nTotal = 4 + 20 + 18 + 4 + 20 = 66.\n\nBecause there is no discount in round 1 (\u03b3^(0)=1) and my outside offer is only worth 1, accepting 66 is much better than my alternative. However, I can try to improve on my 66 by crafting a counteroffer that gives me a higher value while giving Player 1 an offer that is still reasonable compared with what they would get if we stick with the status quo.\n\nNote that if I counteroffer, I specify the numbers of each item that I will give to Player 1; my own bundle is whatever remains from the total available ([5,5,5,4,4]). In the current division (if I were to simply accept Player 1\u2019s offer), Player 1\u2019s bundle is [3,3,3,2,2].\n\nIn order to increase my payoff I want to keep more of the items I value highly (items 2, 3, 5 have my values 10, 9, and 10). One reasonable counteroffer is to offer Player 1 [3,3,2,2,2]. Under that proposal the division would be:\n\n\u2022 For item 1: I give 3 units to Player 1 and keep 5\u20133 = 2 units. My value: 2\u00d72 = 4.  \n\u2022 For item 2: I give 3 (keep 2) \u2192 2\u00d710 = 20.  \n\u2022 For item 3: I give 2 (keep 3) \u2192 3\u00d79 = 27.  \n\u2022 For item 4: I give 2 (keep 2) \u2192 2\u00d72 = 4.  \n\u2022 For item 5: I give 2 (keep 4) \u2192 4\u00d710 = 40.\n\nMy total value then is 4 + 20 + 27 + 4 + 40 = 95.\n\nPlayer 1\u2019s bundle under that counteroffer would be [3,3,2,2,2]\u2014compared to what they would have gotten if I accepted (which is [3,3,3,2,2]). They would get one unit less of item 3. That small drop might be acceptable to Player 1 in round 1 given that a delay reduces the overall value (\u03b3 = 0.9 for later rounds), and I improve my own payoff considerably.\n\nThus, by counteroffering [3,3,2,2,2] (which means I assign 3 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5 to Player 1), I stand to get 95 in my valuation, which is a clear improvement over 66 while still giving Player 1 nearly what they had in the original offer.\n\nI now choose to send this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 2, 2, 2]}",

This arrangement should be generous enough to be considered by the opponent while maximizing my interests.\n\n4. **Example Counteroffer:**\n   - Offer Player 2: \n     - 2 units of Item 1, I keep 1 unit: My value = 1\n     - 2 units of Item 2, I keep 3 units: My value = 9\n     - 1 units of Item 3, I keep 2 units: My value = 6\n     - 2 units of Item 4, I keep 1 unit: My value = 1\n     - 2 units of Item 5, I keep 3 units: My value = 15\n   - Total value = 1 + 9 + 6 + 1 + 15 = 32\n\nGiven this calculation, a reasonable initial offer is [2, 2, 1, 2, 2], resulting in a total value to me of 32, which is significantly above my outside offer.\n\nI will proceed with the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

I also have an outside offer of 71, so any deal I accept must be at least worth 71 in my private evaluation.\n\nStep 2: The current offer on the table (from Player 1) is [2, 2, 1, 2, 2].

Since I want to maximize my share while offering just enough to make the deal plausible for Player 1, I aim to give away items I value relatively little. In my case, item 2 is the least valuable (value 1 per unit). \n\nStep 4: A promising idea is to offer Player 1 just 1 unit of item 2. In that case, the division would be:\n\u2003Offer to Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nAnd I would receive the remainder:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4 units \u2192 4 \u00d7 1 = 4\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 5 units \u2192 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\nTotal value for me = 24 + 4 + 6 + 27 + 10 = 71\n\nStep 5: With this counteroffer, I secure a deal that gives me exactly 71 (equal to my outside offer). At this point (Round 1) there is no discount (gamma^(0) = 1) so this offer is immediately competitive compared to my outside option. Moreover, by offering Player 1 something (albeit a small unit of an item I value little), I might incentivize them to accept rather than resorting to their outside option.\n\nThus, my action is to make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}",

Even if I counteroffer to try to secure a better allocation, note that the absolute maximum value I could get by taking everything is (3\u00d78 + 5\u00d71 + 3\u00d72 + 3\u00d79 + 5\u00d72 = 72), but discounted it would be 72\u00d70.9 = 64.8, which is still below 71.\n\nSince any negotiated deal in round 2 will be discounted and deliver less than my outside offer, my best move is to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

My strategy is to offer Player 2 a portion of the items such that the items I keep are comfortably above my outside offer value of 22.\n\n   Let's consider an offer where Player 2 gets:\n   - 1 unit of item 1\n   - 2 units of item 2\n   - 2 units of item 3\n   - 3 units of item 4\n   - 2 units of item 5\n\n   **Calculate the value I keep:**\n   - Item 1: (3 - 1) units = 2 units, value = 2 x 9 = 18\n   - Item 2: (4 - 2) units = 2 units, value = 2 x 9 = 18\n   - Item 3: (5 - 2) units = 3 units, value = 3 x 8 = 24\n   - Item 4: (5 - 3) units = 2 units, value = 2 x 6 = 12\n   - Item 5: (4 - 2) units = 2 units, value = 2 x 6 = 12\n   - Total value I keep = 18 + 18 + 24 + 12 + 12 = 84\n\nMy retained value (84) is far above my outside offer (22), which is a strong start. This offer leaves Player 2 with items that could potentially be attractive depending on their values.\n\n**Initial Offer (What I propose to give to Player 2):**\n- [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\nThe goal is to ensure the value I retain is significantly higher than 22 while considering it might be adjusted by Player 2.\n\nHere's my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]}\n```",

In a counteroffer as Player 2, the move \u201cCOUNTEROFFER\u201d specifies the items you give to Player 1. Whatever you offer them, you will receive the remaining items. The total items available are:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3; Item 2: 4; Item 3: 5; Item 4: 5; Item 5: 4.\nSo if you offer an allocation represented as [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5] to Player 1, you receive:\n\u2003\u2003[3 \u2013 o1, 4 \u2013 o2, 5 \u2013 o3, 5 \u2013 o4, 4 \u2013 o5].\n\n3. Your value for your own allocation is computed as:\n\u2003\u2003Value = 3(3-o1) + 5(4-o2) + 2(5-o3) + 9(5-o4) + 10(4-o5) = 124 \u2013 [3o1 + 5o2 + 2o3 + 9o4 + 10o5].\nTo do at least as well as your outside offer, you need\n\u2003\u2003124 \u2013 (3o1+5o2+2o3+9o4+10o5) \u2265 108\u2003\u27f9\u20033o1+5o2+2o3+9o4+10o5 \u2264 16.\n\n4. One simple and valid possibility is to offer Player 1 an allocation that, according to your values, totals exactly 16. For example, if you choose o1 = 2 and o5 = 1 (and o2, o3, o4 = 0), then:\n\u2003\u20033\u00d72 + 5\u00d70 + 2\u00d70 + 9\u00d70 + 10\u00d71 = 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 = 16.\nThen your share becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3 \u2013 2 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 4 \u2013 0 = 4,\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 5 \u2013 0 = 5,\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 5 \u2013 0 = 5,\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 4 \u2013 1 = 3.\nYour value becomes:\n\u2003\u20031\u00d73 + 4\u00d75 + 5\u00d72 + 5\u00d79 + 3\u00d710 = 3 + 20 + 10 + 45 + 30 = 108.\nThis exactly matches your outside offer. Since your fallback is 108, you are indifferent in terms of payoff\u2014but if Player 1 accepts this division, you secure your outside offer value without delay. (Pushing for more than 108 might risk rejection if Player 1\u2019s outside offer is higher than what they would get.)\n\n5. Therefore, given that the current offer yields only 64, it is better to counter with a deal that secures at least your outside offer value. The counteroffer [2, 0, 0, 0, 1] gives you exactly 108 in present value.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

Since the total maximum value (if I got every item) is 161, I can only \u201cafford\u201d to concede items worth at most 20 in my own measure (because 161 \u2013 141 = 20). In making any counteroffer, I must choose numbers x\u2081,\u2026, x\u2085 (the quantities I hand to Player 1) so that I get all remaining \u2013 and my value would be:\n\n\u2003Total value to me = 5*(5 \u2013 x\u2081) + 2*(4 \u2013 x\u2082) + 5*(5 \u2013 x\u2083) + 9*(7 \u2013 x\u2084) + 10*(4 \u2013 x\u2085)\n\nThis has to be at least 141. In effect, I can only \u201cpay\u201d up to a total of 20 (in my value) to Player 1. For example, if I offered something like [1,4,1,0,0], that would cost me 5 + 8 + 5 = 18 (leaving me 161 \u2013 18 = 143). While that meets my threshold, notice that it gives Player 1 only a few items. (For instance, if his private value per unit were around the typical average of about 6, his expected value from 1 unit of item1, 4 of item2, and 1 of item3 would be roughly 1\u00d76 + 4\u00d76 + 1\u00d76 = 36, which is very low compared to his likely outside offer \u2013 remember his outside offer is drawn uniformly from 1 to his total, which (on average) would be around 150/2 =75.) \n\nBecause of the tight gap (I can only sacrifice about 20 in my measure) and because any division that gives me nearly the full pie leaves Player 1 with very little (likely far below his reservation), any counteroffer I propose is quite unlikely to be acceptable. \n\nSince the current offer is very poor (51) and my only \u201cdeal\u2010making\u201d leverage would force me to achieve almost all of the total 161 (thus barely beating my 141 outside option), my best (risk\u2010free) move is not to continue negotiating for a deal that is unlikely to be accepted, but rather to WALK away and secure my outside offer of 141.\n\nThus, my action is:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

To improve my outcome, I want my final share (without discount, since we\u2019re in round 1) to be more than 66. I can \u201csacrifice\u201d some of the items that are low in my private value (item 1 is worth only 2 per unit and item 2 is worth 3 per unit) and keep the higher\u2010valued items (items 3, 4, and 5).\n\nIf I give nothing away I would get 88; so the \u201closs\u201d I need to incur (sacrifice) is 88 minus what I want. I want to push for as high a value as possible while still leaving something for Player 1 to accept. For example, if I try to get 78 for myself then I must give up 88 \u2013 78 = 10 value points. However, because items come in fixed integer units, it is not always possible to adjust the loss by any number.\n\nOne good option is to give away some units of items 1 and 2. For instance, if I offer Player 1 2 units of item 1 and 2 units of item 2 the loss to me is:\n\u2022 Item 1: 2 units at 2 each = 4\n\u2022 Item 2: 2 units at 3 each = 6\nTotal loss = 4+6 = 10 points.\nThen my share becomes:\n\u2022 Item 1: 3 \u2013 2 = 1 unit  \u2192 1\u00d72 = 2\n\u2022 Item 2: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d73 = 6\n\u2022 Item 3: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d75 = 10\n\u2022 Item 4: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d710 = 20\n\u2022 Item 5: 5 \u2013 0 = 5 units \u2192 5\u00d78 = 40\nTotal for me = 2 + 6 + 10 + 20 + 40 = 78\n\nThis gives me 78, which is notably above my reservation value of 66. Although a more aggressive offer might make Player 1 less happy, it is still a counteroffer that secures me 78 in value (if accepted) and I can always fall back on my outside option of 66 if negotiations fail.\n\nThus, my counteroffer is to give Player 1:\n\u2003Item 1: 2, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 0, Item 5: 0.\n\nI now provide my action in the required JSON format.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]}",

The need to retain value exceeding the 98 threshold suggests even further potential recalibrations herein could proceed iteratively on-demand.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIt would seem initial calculations and rebounding offer have not yet breached satisfactory levels, thereby necessitating further nuanced scrutiny in actual game model or predetermined walk conditions suitable when similar propositions arise contextually. In essence, a primary more insightful transpositional element could better inform successive iterations favorably. Yet without an improved offering inherently akin with perfect equilibrium, particularly adherence upon external offer exceeding adjusted theoretical approximations presently noted, alternative provision remains contextualized.\n\nThus a viable proposition might infer:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 163. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 163. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 129 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I first check the value to me of the current offer. I would receive:\n\u2022 1 unit of item 1: 1\u00d79 = 9\n\u2022 3 units of item 2: 3\u00d78 = 24\n\u2022 1 unit of item 3: 1\u00d710 = 10\n\u2022 1 unit of item 4: 1\u00d78 = 8\n\u2022 2 units of item 5: 2\u00d78 = 16\nTotal = 9+24+10+8+16 = 67.\nSince we\u2019re in round 2 and the discount factor is \u03b3 = 0.9, the present value of this deal would be 67\u00d70.9 = 60.3. \n\nMy outside offer is 163. So accepting the current deal is far worse than my walk\u2010away alternative.\n\nNow, if I consider making a counteroffer it must be appealing enough to Player\u202f1; otherwise, they will reject it and we both get our outside offers. In my own tally, the total undiscounted value of all items for me is 187. Because any deal reached in round 2 is discounted by 0.9, in order to beat my outside option I\u2019d need a deal that gives me at least 163/0.9 \u2248 181.11 value before discounting (or at least 182 when working with whole units).\n\nThe only way for me to secure at least 182 of value is to keep almost everything for myself. For example, if I ask for the whole bundle I get 187 (which discounted is 187\u00d70.9 = 168.3 > 163), so that would be acceptable from my point\u2010of\u2010view. However, that would leave Player\u202f1 with nothing. Since Player\u202f1\u2019s own outcome includes their private outside offer (and likely a positive expectation for getting some items), they would have no reason to accept an offer where they receive [0,0,0,0,0].\n\nAny attempt to give even one unit (the smallest concession available is from item types with my unit values 8, 9, or 10) will drop my share by at least 8 points, reducing my total well below 182. That would mean my deal (when discounted) would then be inferior to my outside offer.\n\nThus, I am caught in a dilemma: if I try to propose any counteroffer other than taking everything, I risk lowering my share below what is needed to beat my outside offer value. And proposing to keep everything is so demanding that Player\u202f1 will certainly reject it. In either case, I end up with my outside offer of 163 if the negotiation fails.\n\nGiven that the current offer (worth 60.3) is far below my guaranteed 163, and that any counteroffer that might give me even a tiny gain (for example, 168.3 if Player\u202f1 miraculously accepted my [0,0,0,0,0] offer) is extremely unlikely to be accepted, the best rational action for me is to walk away now and secure my outside offer of 163.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

So I chose to give him all 3 units of item 4 (cost = 3\u00d72 = 6). This leaves 18 \u2013 6 = 12 \u201ccost-budget\u201d to give him more items. The next cheapest is item\u00a01 at 6 per unit. Using a cost of 12 means giving him 2 units of item\u00a01 (2\u00d76 = 12). \n\nThus my counteroffer is to give Player\u00a01 2 units of item\u00a01 and 3 units of item\u00a04 (and nothing of the other items).

Comparing:\n\u2003\u2022 Accepting the current offer \u2192 present value = 55.8.\n\u2003\u2022 Any counteroffer accepted in round 3 \u2192 at most around 106.92 (and likely less if I try to incentivize Player 1).\n\u2003\u2022 Walking away \u2192 I secure 114.\n\u2003Since 114 > 55.8 and even > a best-case round-3 agreement, my best guaranteed outcome is to take the outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my action is to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

In doing so, I want to \u201ckeep\u201d the items I value highly \u2013 especially item\u202f1 (worth 9) and item\u202f5 (worth 10). (I also note that item\u202f2 is moderately important to me, but I can afford to concede some of it if that makes the offer more acceptable to Player\u202f1.) Items 3 and 4 are lower\u2010value for me, so I don\u2019t mind handing those over completely.\n\nOne extreme would be to try to take everything on items 1 and 5 (all units) and also keep some of item\u202f2. For example, if I offered Player\u202f1 [0, 3, 7, 2, 0] I would \u201ckeep\u201d:\n\u2003Item\u202f1: 3 (all)\u2003\u2192 3\u00d79 = 27  \n\u2003Item\u202f2: 4 \u2013 3 = 1\u2003\u2003\u2192 1\u00d76 = 6  \n\u2003Item\u202f5: 2 (all)\u2003\u2003\u2192 2\u00d710 = 20  \n\u2014for a total of 27 + 6 + 20 = 53. However, this offer gives Player\u202f1 nothing of my highest\u2010valued item (item\u202f1) even though in their own original offer they got all of it. That might be too \u201chard\u201d an offer for them to accept.\n\nA slightly more balanced (but still profitable to me) option is to concede a little in item\u202f1 in exchange for making the deal more attractive to Player\u202f1. For example, if I offer Player\u202f1 [1, 3, 7, 2, 0] then my allocation becomes:\n\u2003Item\u202f1: 3 \u2013 1 = 2\u2003\u2003\u2192 2\u00d79 = 18  \n\u2003Item\u202f2: 4 \u2013 3 = 1\u2003\u2003\u2192 1\u00d76 = 6  \n\u2003Item\u202f3: 7 \u2013 7 = 0\u2003\u2003\u2192 0  \n\u2003Item\u202f4: 2 \u2013 2 = 0\u2003\u2003\u2192 0  \n\u2003Item\u202f5: 2 \u2013 0 = 2\u2003\u2003\u2192 2\u00d710 = 20  \nfor a total value of 18 + 6 + 20 = 44.\n\nUnder this counteroffer, Player\u202f1 would receive:\n\u2003Item\u202f1: 1 unit  \n\u2003Item\u202f2: 3 units  \n\u2003Item\u202f3: all 7 units  \n\u2003Item\u202f4: all 2 units  \n\u2003Item\u202f5: 0 units\n\nCompared to their original plan (they would have gotten [3, 0, 7, 2, 2] if I accepted their offer), they now get more of items (like item\u202f2) that might be more attractive to them while I \u201ccapture\u201d the high\u2013value items for myself. Although I reduce my own total (44 instead of 53), this leaves a bit more \u201ccredit\u201d for Player\u202f1 so that they have a better chance of accepting the deal rather than waiting another round (which would cause a discount on both sides).\n\nSince 44 is significantly higher than the 24 I\u2019d lock in by accepting, and given that my outside option is only 1, this counteroffer is attractive for me. (Of course, I cannot know Player 1\u2019s private values exactly, but offering them a share that improves on their current \u201cplan\u201d increases the likelihood of reaching agreement.)\n\nThus, I decide to respond in round 1 with the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 7, 2, 0]}",

Ideally, more advantageous than current 33 value after accounting for continued negotiations.\n\n4. **Evaluate a Potential Counteroffer (for example):**\n   - Suppose I offer Player 2: [1, 3, 4, 1, 0]\n     - This means I keep: [2, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n     - Value of keeping:\n       - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4\n       - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n       - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 9 = 27\n       - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 8 = 8\n       - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n     - Total Value = 4 + 9 + 27 + 8 + 20 = 68\n\nThis counteroffer is less than my outside offer value, so I need to keep considering counteroffers or walking away due to not surpassing the importance of 90 with current receiving structure. Considering my outside option provides more value presently or after a maximum possbile delay, it would be strategic to avoid further erosion of my position by pursuing another counteroffer unsuccessful with inside value. Therefore:\n\n**Decision**: Given that the current offer and the potential counteroffer evaluations do not provide a value greater than my outside option post round adjustments and the fact this round is nearing the end of negotiations, I should WALK away to secure the certainty of my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Note that I particularly favor items 4 and 5 (per\u2010unit values 8 and 7); thus I want to keep more of those and be a bit more generous with which items I give up.\n\nFor example, if I propose giving Player 1:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 3, item2: 2, item3: 4, item4: 1, item5: 1,\nthen I get:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 5\u20133 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003item2: 4\u20132 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003item3: 8\u20134 = 4,\n\u2003\u2003item4: 5\u20131 = 4,\n\u2003\u2003item5: 3\u20131 = 2.\nMy value is computed as:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d76 = 12 (item1)\u2003+\u20032\u00d76 = 12 (item2)\u2003+\u20034\u00d76 = 24 (item3)\u2003+\u20034\u00d78 = 32 (item4)\u2003+\u20032\u00d77 = 14 (item5),\nwhich sums to 12+12+24+32+14 = 94.\nThis 94 is well above my outside offer value.\n\nThe proposed division is valid (the counts add correctly: for item1, 3+2=5; item2, 2+2=4; item3, 4+4=8; item4, 1+4=5; item5, 1+2=3). It gives me a significantly better deal than the current offer while leaving a potentially attractive split for Player 1 in round 1.\n\nThus, my response is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3,2,4,1,1]}",

Let's try another.\n\n5. **Reevaluated Counteroffer:**\n   - Prioritize keeping higher-value items (2 and 4) and potentially more of the medium-value items.\n\n   Evaluated Counteroffer Strategy:\n   - Give Player 2:\n     - Item 1: 0\n     - Item 2: 1 (I keep 3)\n     - Item 3: 3 (I keep 0)\n     - Item 4: 0\n     - Item 5: 2 (I keep 0)\n   \n   Re-calculate value of the outcome for me:\n   - Value of item 1 for me: \\(4\\)\n   - Value of item 2 for me: \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\)\n   - Value of item 3 for me: \\(0\\)\n   - Value of item 4 for me: \\(18\\)\n   - Value of item 5 for me: \\(0\\)\n   \n   Total value of my holding: \\(4 + 30 + 18 = 52\\)\n  \n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - I will adjust further, focusing on achieving a value exceeding 67. This scenario hints at giving more of item 3, which is lowest in value.\n\n   Final Counteroffer:\n   - Give Player 2:\n     - Item 1: 0 (I keep 1)\n     - Item 2: 1 (I keep 3)\n     - Item 3: 3 (I keep 0)\n     - Item 4: 1 (I keep 1)\n     - Item 5: 2 (I keep 0)\n   \n   Revised calculation:\n   - Value recalculation:\n     - My value = \\(4 + 30 + 9 + 0 = 43\\) (this value is still below 67, but this approach indicates further rebalancing is needed).\n\nGiven this approach, my next step is to iterate on this offering, each time ensuring the sum exceeds 67 when discounted:\n\n7. **Action:**\n   From the example above, keeping higher-value items and further iterating is vital. \n\n   Adjust this step to ensure acceptance of our items towards a solution under round 2 or pare down constraints to me, potentially leading us to make a counteroffer with improved subsequent tradeoffs.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]}\n```",

A counteroffer in round 1 has me specify the amount of each item I\u2019d give to Player 1 (with me receiving the leftovers).

If I estimate that Player 1 would need roughly 40\u201350 \u201cvalue points\u201d in their own private valuation to be persuaded to accept a deal in round 1, then even in the most generous division for them (and so very costly to me) I would be left with roughly 118 \u2013 50 = 68, well below my fallback of 80.\n\nThus, any counteroffer that is \u201cacceptable\u201d to Player 1 (given they have their own outside offer which might not be very low) will force me into a division where my value (by my known private numbers) is less than what I get if we do no deal (i.e. 80).\n\nBecause the current offer gives me only 46 (far below 80) and any \u201cworkable\u201d deal that might satisfy Player 1 would force me to give up so much that I\u2019d be below my guaranteed outside option, it is best for me not to negotiate further.\n\nTherefore, my best action is to WALK away and take my outside offer value of 80.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

I previously offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 3], and Player 2 countered it significantly higher, which indicates they want more items, especially items 1, 2, and 5.\n\nLet's try to maximize my value while still improving the current offer to entice Player 2.\n\nI will propose:\n- Give Player 2: [3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n  \nThis offer would leave me with:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n\nTotal value for me:\n\\[\n20 + 20 + 2 + 2 + 36 = 80\n\\]\n\nWith the discount factor:\n\\[\n80 \\times 0.9 = 72\n\\]\n\nThis value of 72 is still below my outside option of 107, but perhaps Player 2 will be compelled to adjust closer to a mutually beneficial option.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 3, 2, 2]}\n```",

I will negotiate starting with a slightly aggressive offer to leave room for concessions later:\n\n- Offer Player 2: \n  - 2 units of Item 1\n  - 1 unit of Item 3\n  - 2 units of Item 5\n\nRemaining for me:\n- Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4 units, value = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n- Item 2: 0 units, value = 0\n- Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4 units, value = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n- Item 4: 4 units, value = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n\nTotal value retained = 36 + 28 + 40 + 24 = 128 \n\n128 is significantly above my outside offer value of 69, providing a good surplus over the threshold.\n\nThus, my initial action is to make this counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 68. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 72 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine an action, I need to evaluate any potential offer I make against my outside offer value of 68. My goal is to maximize my value, ensuring it exceeds my outside offer.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my current item values:\n\n- Item 1: 2 per unit\n- Item 2: 10 per unit\n- Item 3: 3 per unit\n- Item 4: 7 per unit\n- Item 5: 2 per unit\n\nGiven these values, my total maximum possible value remains at 87 if I were to keep all items.\n\nLet's create a potential initial offer:\n\n1. To surpass my outside offer and ensure a viable deal, I need the cumulative value of the items I keep to surpass at least 68. \n2. I will start by offering fewer items with high value to Player 2 and keep more items that are valuable to me. Let's try offering Player 2 one unit of each item and evaluate my value for the leftover items:\n\n- Offer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (offering Player 2 one unit of each item)\n\nEvaluate the values with the leftovers for me (subtracting the offered units):\n\n- 4 units of item 1 to me = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n- 2 units of item 2 to me = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- 2 units of item 3 to me = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- 3 units of item 4 to me = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n- 4 units of item 5 to me = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n\nTotal value to me = 8 + 20 + 6 + 21 + 8 = 63\n\nThe total value of this offer to me is 63, which is below my outside offer value of 68. Thus, I need to adjust this in a way that meets or exceeds my outside offer value.\n\nLet's adjust to favor my high-value item (item 2) more:\n\nPropose offering: [3, 0, 2, 2, 3] (keeping as many item 2s as possible to maximize my value)\n\nLet's evaluate this offer:\n\n- 2 units of item 1 to me = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 3 units of item 2 to me = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 1 unit of item 3 to me = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 2 units of item 4 to me = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- 2 units of item 5 to me = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n\nTotal value to me = 4 + 30 + 3 + 14 + 4 = 55\n\nThis offer still doesn't reach my outside offer value. \n\nThe challenge remains simplifying the offer to retain more high-value items, predominantly item 2, along with more items 4. Let's make a final adjustment:\n\nOffer: [4, 0, 3, 2, 3]\n\nEvaluating:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 to me = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n- 3 units of item 2 to me = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 0 units of item 3 to me = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- 2 units of item 4 to me = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- 2 units of item 5 to me = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n\nTotal adjusted value = 2 + 30 + 0 + 14 + 4 = 50\n\nI still find difficulty reaching 68. Therefore, based on current value outcomes of each division scenario, the optimization of my offer could consider adjusting for higher values kept. Let me counteroffer to optimize:\n\n- Final proposed offer: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4]\n\nOffer evaluation:\n\n- 0 unit of item 1 to me = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n- 3 units of item 2 to me = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 0 units of item 3 to me = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- 4 units of item 4 to me = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n- 1 unit of item 5 to me = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n\nTotal value = 0 + 30 + 0 + 28 + 2 = 60\n\nThis action attempts to reach a conclusion that suits for leverage further negotiation during subsequent turns.\n\nSo my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 3, 0, 4]}\n```",

In Round 1, there is no discount, so my target is to receive at least 80 in value from my share.\n\n### Initial Strategy\nFor my initial offer, I need to ensure that I retain at least the equivalent value of my outside offer. I will propose a division that maximizes my retained value while leaving some value for Player 2.\n\n### Propose a Counteroffer\nTo formulate an equitable offer, I'll balance giving away less valuable items or fewer units of high-value items, aiming to keep most of what is valuable to me. One possible way to achieve this is to consider estimates of what might be reasonable for Player 2 while ensuring my value consideration exceeds 80.\n\n### Possible Offer to Player 2\n- I'll offer 1 unit of Item 1 (Value to me: 7)\n- I'll offer 2 units of Item 2 (Value to me: 6)\n- I'll offer 1 unit of Item 3 (Value to me: 5)\n- I'll offer 4 units of Item 4 (Value to me: 4)\n- I'll offer 4 units of Item 5 (Value to me: 12)\n\n**Total Value of Items Kept by Me = (4 units * 7) + (3 units * 3) + (3 units * 5) + (1 unit * 1) + (1 unit * 3)**\n= 28 + 9 + 15 + 1 + 3 \n= 56\n\nThis is less than 80 and likely needs me to reconsider since I must exceed 80. Let's adjust by taking a stricter stance on the high-value items (Item 1 and Item 3):\n\n### Recalculate and Revise Offer\nOffer to Player 2:\n- 0 unit of Item 1\n- 3 units of Item 2\n- 0 unit of Item 3\n- 4 units of Item 4\n- 4 units of Item 5\n\n**Total Value of Items Kept by Me = (5 units * 7) + (2 units * 3) + (4 units * 5) + (1 unit * 1) + (1 unit * 3)**\n= 35 + 6 + 20 + 1 + 3 \n= 65\n\nThis is again less than 80. I need this amount to value more than 80. I need to make sure to keep more units of higher value items or reduce loss from currently less valued items.\n\nCounteroffer Adjustment:\nOffer to Player 2:\n- 1 unit of Item 1\n- 1 units of Item 2\n- 1 unit of Item 3\n- 3 units of Item 4\n- 3 units of Item 5\n\n**Recalculate Value of Items I Keep:**\n- Value to Me After Offer:\n  - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n  - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n\n**Total Value = 28 + 12 + 15 + 2 + 6 = 63**\n\n### Evaluation\nThe offer should equate beyond 80 value: review for maximizing offer matching Round 1 value requirements alone or constraint getting Player 2 interested.\nI might provide a smaller share alongside my outside opportunity and the offer's value. Optimal leverage shows I must be closer to accepting my offer or impose another value.\n\n### Determined Action\n\nGiven the above, I resolve a secured yet attractive proposal. If considered achievable by Player 2, ensuring results rank better post-discount or through negotiation trades:\nOpt to secure rather than overextend or undercut offer scales.\n\nThus, my determined counteroffer is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]}\n```\n\nThis assures some value and preserves balance to my prospective decision while I review continuatively towards or through Player 2's adjustments.",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 48. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 75 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 6, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Additionally, I should consider whether making a counteroffer makes sense in terms of maximizing my value while keeping in mind the negotiation dynamic.\n\n### Current Offer Analysis\nThe current offer on the table is [0, 6, 4, 0, 0]. Let's evaluate its value to me:\n\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- 2 units of item 2 = (8 - 6) \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 3 units of item 3 = (7 - 4) \u00d7 3 = 9\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 1 units of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n\nThe total value of accepting the current offer is 0 + 4 + 9 + 30 + 7 = 50.\n\n### Comparison with Outside Offer\nMy outside offer is valued at 48. Accepting the current offer provides a value of 50, which is slightly better than walking away for my outside offer. However, considering the negotiation discount factor (gamma = 0.9) in round 2, the present value of accepting this offer is 50 \u00d7 (0.9)^1 = 45. \n\nThe adjusted value of accepting is less than my outside offer's value of 48.\n\n### Decision\nSince the adjusted value of accepting the current offer is less than the value of my outside offer, I should not accept the current offer. Instead, I should make a counteroffer that potentially maximizes my value while being reasonably acceptable to Player 2.\n\n### Counteroffer Proposal\nTo improve my position, let's propose a counteroffer slightly better for me:\n\n- Keep all of item 1 for myself as it's highly valued by me. Offer none.\n- Offer 6 out of 8 units of item 2 (as previously).\n- Offer 4 units of item 3 (as previously, but I will reduce it to 3) and keep 4 units.\n- Keep all of item 4 for myself again, as it's the most valuable to me.\n- Keep all of item 5 for myself.\n\nProposed counteroffer: [0, 6, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCalculation of the value from the proposed counteroffer to me:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 1 units of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n\nTotal value = 6 + 4 + 12 + 30 + 7 = 59\n\nWith the discount factor in mind: 59 \u00d7 (0.9)^1 = 53.1\n\nThe value of counteroffering is higher than my outside offer. Hence, I will proceed with this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 6, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Step 1. Evaluate the current offer. Player 1\u2019s current offer is [0, 6, 3, 0, 0] (meaning if you ACCEPT, you receive 0 of item1, 6 of item2, 3 of item3, and 0 of items4 and 5). Your per\u2010unit values are: item1 = 8, item2 = 9, item3 = 7, item4 = 10, item5 = 8. So the raw value of the current offer is:\n\u2022\u2003Item2: 6 \u00d7 9 = 54\n\u2022\u2003Item3: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\nTotal = 54 + 21 = 75.\nSince this deal is reached in round 2 the discount factor is \u03b3^(2\u20131) = 0.9. The present (discounted) value is 0.9 \u00d7 75 = 67.5 which is lower than your outside option of 93.\n\nStep 2. Decide to make a counteroffer. In a counteroffer you specify what you give to Player 1. You keep, for each item, \u201ctotal available\u201d minus the number you offer. Your total available amounts are:\n\u2003Item1: 2,\u2003Item2: 8,\u2003Item3: 7,\u2003Item4: 3,\u2003Item5: 1.\nYour objective is to guarantee a deal that, when discounted by 0.9, is worth at least 93 to you. That means your raw (undiscounted) value should be at least 93/0.9 \u2248 103.33.\n\nStep 3. Design a counteroffer that gives you high\u2010value items while offering concessions on items that Player 1 appears to prize. Notice Player 1\u2019s sequential offers have always involved giving you (almost) all of item2 but gradually less of item3. (For example, in round 1 they offered [0,6,5,0,0] then [0,6,4,0,0] and finally now [0,6,3,0,0]). This indicates that Player 1 very likely wants to keep many of the available units of item3.\nOne plan is to \u201clet them have\u201d almost all of item3. For instance, if you give them 6 of item3, then you keep 7\u20136 = 1 unit of item3. At the same time, you want to keep the items you highly value:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item1: value 8 each (total 2 units) \u2192 keep all 2 units.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item4 (3 units, 10 each) and item5 (1 unit, 8 each) \u2192 keep all.\nFor item2 (value 9 each) you can afford to concede a little while still keeping enough for yourself. For example, if you give them 2 units of item2, you keep 8\u20132 = 6 units of item2.\n\nStep 4. Compute your kept amounts and verify they beat your outside offer:\nKeep:\n\u2003Item1: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n\u2003Item2: 6 units \u2192 6 \u00d7 9 = 54\n\u2003Item3: 1 unit \u2192 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n\u2003Item4: 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n\u2003Item5: 1 unit \u2192 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\nRaw total = 16 + 54 + 7 + 30 + 8 = 115.\nDiscounted value (0.9 factor) = 0.9 \u00d7 115 = 103.5, which is above your outside offer of 93.\n\nPlayer 1 would then receive:\n\u2003Item1: 0\n\u2003Item2: 2\n\u2003Item3: 6\n\u2003Item4: 0\n\u2003Item5: 0\nThis offer gives Player 1 most of item3 (6 units), which is even better than in previous rounds where they ended up with only 4 or 5 units of item3. (Their offers always gave you 3 to 5 units of item3.) This concession may help in making your counteroffer attractive to Player 1.\n\nStep 5. Act.\nYour counteroffer is to give Player 1: [0, 2, 6, 0, 0].\n\nThus, your response is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 6, 0, 0]}",

Let's try again with a revised strategy:\n\n- **Item 1:** Retain 5 units (worth 50)\n- **Item 2:** Retain 5 units (worth 15), Offer 1 unit\n- **Item 4:** Offer entire lot (5 units)\n- **Item 5:** Keep 3 units (worth 9)\n\nCalculate:\n\n- 5 units of item 1 worth 50\n- 5 units of item 2 worth 15\n- 1 unit of item 3 worth 10\n- 3 units of item 5 worth 9\n\nTotal retained value = 84\n\nAfter recalculating my counteroffer to match the 90 threshold within the constraints of available items yields:\n\n- **Item 1:** Retain 5 units (worth 50)\n- **Item 2:** Retain 3 units (worth 9), Offer 3 units\n- **Item 3:** Retain 1 unit (worth 10)\n- **Item 4:** Offer all 5 units\n- **Item 5:** Retain 3 units (worth 9)\n\nMy revised calculation gives a retained value of 78, which is still too low. Considering round values again to try maximizing, I will prioritize as:\n\n- **Offer:** [0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5].\n\nLet me propose an initial offer with care for the maximum value retention above my current outside offer value of 90.\n\nI must reevaluate my strategy to improve the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 66. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 78 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 4, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 10, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I want to do better than the current offer. Right now, Player 1 is offering you (Player 2) [2, 0, 0, 8, 0] which would give you:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1: 2 units \u2192 2\u00d75 = 10\n\u2003\u2022 item 2: 0 units \u2192 0\u00d77 = 0\n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 0 units \u2192 0\u00d76 = 0\n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 8 units \u2192 8\u00d72 = 16\n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 0 units \u2192 0\u00d76 = 0\nTotal raw value = 10+16 = 26.\u2003When discounted by \u03b3 = 0.9 (since it\u2019s round 2) you\u2019d get 26\u00d70.9 = 23.4, which is far below your outside offer of 66.\n\nWhen it is your turn to counteroffer, you must \u201coffer\u201d Player 1 some units so that you (Player 2) will keep the remainder. In other words, if you make a counteroffer X = [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5] then your share becomes:\n\u2003[6 \u2013 x1,\u20033 \u2013 x2,\u20033 \u2013 x3,\u200310 \u2013 x4,\u20032 \u2013 x5].\nYour raw value if the deal is reached in round 2 is then:\n\u20035\u00d7(6\u2013x1) + 7\u00d7(3\u2013x2) + 6\u00d7(3\u2013x3) + 2\u00d7(10\u2013x4) + 6\u00d7(2\u2013x5).\nBecause the final deal is discounted by 0.9 (since r = 2, so \u03b3^(2\u20131) = 0.9), you need your raw value to be high enough so that 0.9\u00d7(raw value) beats (or at least matches) your outside offer of 66. (That means you\u2019d like your raw value to be at least about 73.33, so roughly 74 or more.)\n\nSince your valuations are highest for items 2, 3, and 5 and lowest for item 4 (only 2 per unit), you want to \u201cconcede\u201d item 4 as much as possible to Player 1 while retaining nearly all of the higher\u2010value items for yourself. (You also note that Player 1\u2019s own offers have tended to \u201csacrifice\u201d items that you value well\u2014such as item 1 and not much of items 2, 3, 5\u2014so you expect that giving up mostly item 4 and maybe a small \u201ctweak\u201d with item 1 can be acceptable to them.)\n\nA natural idea is to consider giving Player 1 nearly all of item 4 (since it\u2019s low for you) while giving them a little bit of item 1 to \u201cbalance\u201d the deal relative to their previous offer. For example, if you were to offer to Player 1 exactly [0, 0, 0, 10, 0] you would keep:\n\u2003item 1: 6 units, item 2: 3 units, item 3: 3 units, item 4: 0 units, item 5: 2 units.\nThat would yield you a raw value of:\n\u20036\u00d75 + 3\u00d77 + 3\u00d76 + 0\u00d72 + 2\u00d76 = 30 + 21 + 18 + 0 + 12 = 81,\ndiscounted to 81\u00d70.9 = 72.9 which is very good for you\u2014but it gives Player 1 only item 4, and from their earlier offers it appears they value keeping some of item 1 as well.\n\nA slight adjustment is to offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 9, 0]. Then your share becomes:\n\u2003item 1: 6\u20131 = 5,\u2003item 2: 3,\u2003item 3: 3,\u2003item 4: 10\u20139 = 1,\u2003item 5: 2.\nYour raw value is:\n\u20035\u00d75 + 3\u00d77 + 3\u00d76 + 1\u00d72 + 2\u00d76 = 25 + 21 + 18 + 2 + 12 = 78,\nand the discounted value is 78\u00d70.9 = 70.2, which beats your outside offer.\nMeanwhile, Player 1 gets [1, 0, 0, 9, 0] (i.e. 1 unit of item 1 and 9 units of item 4). This is \u201cclose\u201d to the spirit of the previous offers, yet gives you even more of your higher\u2010valued items (items 2, 3, and 5) and thus a better outcome.\n\nThus, I choose to propose the counteroffer:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 9, 0]}",

I will keep more of the higher valued items.\n\nRevised counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 0 unit\n- Item 4: 0 unit\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\n#### Total Value:\n- 1 x 9 (Item 1) = 9\n- 3 x 9 (Item 2) = 27\n- 1 x 3 (Item 3) = 3\n- 3 x 2 (Item 4) = 6\n- 4 x 6 (Item 5) = 24\n\nTotal value: 69\n\nThis increase in retained quantity still doesn't reach the required value.\n\nFinal revised offer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 0 unit\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 0 units\n\n#### Final Total Value:\n- 1 x 9 (Item 1) = 9\n- 3 x 9 (Item 2) = 27\n- 1 x 3 (Item 3) = 3\n- 3 x 2 (Item 4) = 6\n- 5 x 6 (Item 5) = 30\n\nTotal value: 75\n\nEven this updated calculation does not suffice my requirement. The only value greater than 83 is derived from my initial position, and since adjustment is not feasible under initial proposal criteria, walking away remains necessary.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

My outside offer is 1, which is significantly less than my total value of 143; thus, I should aim to secure a deal worth more than my outside option.\n\n3. Propose an initial offer where I try to keep the majority of high-value items while offering less significant parts to Player 2. Let's use this strategy: I will keep a maximum of the valuable items like Item 5, and offer a fair division to entice Player 2.\n\n4. My counteroffer strategy:\n   - Item 1: Offer 1 unit (I keep 2)\n   - Item 2: Offer 1 unit (I keep 2)\n   - Item 3: Offer 1 unit (I keep 2)\n   - Item 4: Offer 2 units (I keep 2)\n   - Item 5: Offer 3 units (I keep 6)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value I would receive:\n   - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 7 value/unit = 14\n   - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 5 value/unit = 10\n   - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 3 value/unit = 6\n   - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 2 value/unit = 4\n   - Item 5: 6 units \u00d7 10 value/unit = 60\n   - Total value = 94\n\nOffering this deal maximizes my retained value while remaining competitive for Player 2 to consider. My current offer gives me a value of 94, which is excellent for maximizing my outcome, given my low outside offer value.\n\nConsidering all aspects, the best action is to move forward with this fair and beneficial counteroffer.

The goal is to maximize my value while ensuring the total value I receive is greater than my outside offer of 35.\n\nFirstly, let's evaluate the total value of all items based on my valuation:\n- Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 6 value/unit = 24\n- Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 3 value/unit = 15\n- Item 3: 6 units \u00d7 5 value/unit = 30\n- Item 4: 7 units \u00d7 2 value/unit = 14\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 7 value/unit = 14\n- Total value = 97\n\nGiven these valuations, I must ensure that my part from any offer calculates to more than 35, the value of my outside offer.\n\nIf I can keep the majority of the items with higher values to myself, I can maximize my value. For instance, focusing on retaining as many units of item 1 and item 3 would be favorable since they have relatively high value per unit.\n\nLet's consider a reasonable division in which I initially offer a balanced share but will still secure a significant portion of the value for myself:\n- Offer Player 2: [2, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n\nCalculating My Remaining Share:\n- Items remaining for me after offer: \n  - Item 1: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n  - Item 2: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n  - Item 3: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - Item 4: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n  - Item 5: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n\nTotal Value from My Share = 12 + 9 + 15 + 8 + 7 = 51\n\nThe total calculated value of 51, which I will receive if Player 2 accepts this offer, is comfortably above my outside offer of 35.

A basic strategy might be to keep the items with the highest value to me.\n\n#### Sample Offer Calculation:\n- Suppose I give Player 2:\n  - 3 units of Item 1 (worth 6 each to me)\n  - 5 units of Item 2 (worth 1 each to me)\n  - 4 units of Item 3 (worth 1 each to me)\n  - 3 units of Item 4 (worth 6 each to me)\n  - 3 units of Item 5 (worth 5 each to me)\n\n#### Calculating My Value with This Offer:\n- I keep 3 units of Item 1: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n- I keep 1 unit of Item 2: \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n- I keep 0 units of Item 3: \\(0 \\times 1 = 0\\)\n- I keep 2 units of Item 4: \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\)\n- I keep 3 units of Item 5: \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n\nTotal value to me: \\(18 + 1 + 0 + 12 + 15 = 46\\)\n\nSince 46 is much less than 92, this is not a viable counteroffer. I need to adjust the offer to retain more value.\n\n### Adjusted Offer:\n- Another approach, keeping more valuable items:\n  - 2 units of Item 1 (worth 6 each to me)\n  - 6 units of Item 2 (worth 1 each to me)\n  - 4 units of Item 3 (worth 1 each to me)\n  - 1 units of Item 4 (worth 6 each to me)\n  - 1 units of Item 5 (worth 5 each to me)\n\n#### Calculating My New Value with This Offer:\n- I keep 4 units of Item 1: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\)\n- I keep 0 unit of Item 2: \\(0 \\times 1 = 0\\)\n- I keep 0 unit of Item 3: \\(0 \\times 1 = 0\\)\n- I keep 4 units of Item 4: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\)\n- I keep 5 units of Item 5: \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)\n\nTotal value to me: \\(24 + 0 + 0 + 24 + 25 = 73\\)\n\nEven with this offer, my value is still below my outside offer of 92.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the constraints, I should present an adjusted counteroffer that allows me to achieve a higher value or, if unable to reach a satisfactory value, consider walking away in the future rounds. Continuing the negotiation with maximal offers is strategically necessary before considering withdrawal in later rounds.\n\nFor this round, I will try a more aggressive offer:\n\n- 1 units of Item 1 (worth 6 each to me)\n- 6 units of Item 2 (worth 1 each to me)\n- 4 units of Item 3 (worth 1 each to me)\n- 1 units of Item 4 (worth 6 each to me)\n- 1 units of Item 5 (worth 5 each to me)\n\nHere is my initial offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 6, 4, 1, 1]}\n```",

We need to adjust the offer to ensure our received value exceeds 93.\n\nLet's revise the offer:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 3 units (keeping 0)\n  - Item 2: 7 units (keeping 0)\n  - Item 3: 1 unit (keeping 3)\n  - Item 4: 1 unit (keeping 4)\n  - Item 5: 0 units (keeping 5)\n\nCalculate adjusted value we keep:\n\n- Item 1: 0 units = 0\n- Item 2: 0 units = 0\n- Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 8 value/unit = 24\n- Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 2 value/unit = 8\n- Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 10 value/unit = 50\n\nNew Total value =  0 + 0 + 24 + 8 + 50 = 82\n\nGiven our initial attempt was still lower, we need to make another alteration where we can get the maximum out of the valuable items without exceeding the overall aim to stay within my outside offer.\n\nI'll go ahead and stick with offering the lower value options but increase the balance of holding important stock from one category more decisively.\n\nRevised plan:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 3 units (keeping 0)\n  - Item 2: 5 units (keeping 2)\n  - Item 3: 1 unit (keeping 3)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (keeping 3)\n  - Item 5: 0 units (keeping 5)\n\n- Evaluating adjusted values:\n  - Our hold Item 1 value: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - Our hold Item 2 value: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n  - Our hold Item 3 value: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n  - Our hold Item 4 value: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n  - Our hold Item 5 value: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n  - Revised value: 2 + 24 + 6 + 50 = 82 (Discount Observation: Not sufficient - next best option in practicality).\n\nFinally, we expand our offer subtly preserving core high-value Item 5, refining as:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 3 units (keeping 0)\n  - Item 2: 5 units (keeping 2)\n  - Item 3: 1 unit (keeping 3)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (keeping 3)\n  - Item 5: 0 units (keeping 5)\n\n- Ensure affirmative of value we maintain:\n\n - 0 (item 1) \n - 5 (item 2) \n - 3 (item 3)\n - 3 (item 4)\n - 5 (item 5)\n \n- Check (+valuable domains) 2, 24, 6, 50 =82 (Consider Feedback-positive unique draft by extending proportionately but maintained expected top worth.)\n\nHence: I should proceed with:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}  - the realistic acceptance locally adheres to safeguard underestimate by not extending back within upper bar on motivational degree 93 whereas proceed strategically pre-empt for next.",

At the same time, I want to offer Player 2 a reasonable share.\n\nHere's the formula for the total value:\nTotal value = (x1 * 8) + (x2 * 5) + (x3 * 3) + (x4 * 8) + (x5 * 5)\n\nGiven:\n- Total units for Item 1: 5\n- Total units for Item 2: 2\n- Total units for Item 3: 6\n- Total units for Item 4: 2\n- Total units for Item 5: 6\n\nLet's try an offer:\n- Offer Player 2: 3 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 3 units of Item 5. \n- I will keep 2 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 3 units of Item 5.\n\nCalculate the value:\n- Value of 2 units of Item 1 = 2 * 8 = 16\n- Value of 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 * 5 = 5\n- Value of 3 units of Item 3 = 3 * 3 = 9\n- Value of 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 * 8 = 8\n- Value of 3 units of Item 5 = 3 * 5 = 15\n\nTotal value I receive = 16 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 15 = 53\n\nThis value of 53 is less than my outside offer of 69, which means I cannot proceed with this particular offer as is. I need to improve the portion I keep. Let's try adjusting the offer:\n\nRevised offer:\n- Offer Player 2: 4 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 4 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, 4 units of Item 5.\n- I will keep 1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5.\n\nCalculate the value:\n- Value of 1 unit of Item 1 = 1 * 8 = 8\n- Value of 2 units of Item 2 = 2 * 5 = 10\n- Value of 2 units of Item 3 = 2 * 3 = 6\n- Value of 2 units of Item 4 = 2 * 8 = 16\n- Value of 2 units of Item 5 = 2 * 5 = 10\n\nTotal value I receive = 8 + 10 + 6 + 16 + 10 = 50\n\nThis value is again less than my outside offer. However, because this is an initial offer, I expect to make compromises during the negotiation. Thus, I should aim to improve upon my outside offer in subsequent rounds.\n\nOne final offer I might consider:\n- Offer Player 2: 3 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 5 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, 4 units of Item 5.\n- I will keep 2 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5.\n\nCalculate the value:\n- Value of 2 units of Item 1 = 2 * 8 = 16\n- Value of 2 units of Item 2 = 2 * 5 = 10\n- Value of 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 * 3 = 3\n- Value of 2 units of Item 4 = 2 * 8 = 16\n- Value of 2 units of Item 5 = 2 * 5 = 10\n\nTotal value I receive = 16 + 10 + 3 + 16 + 10 = 55\n\nWhile this offer is still less than my outside offer, it provides a reasonable starting point with room for discussion and improvement.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 5, 0, 4]}",

Instead, I could be more aggressive by keeping all high-value items and testing their response in Round 1 since compromising here gives me no advantage over the outside offer.\n\nLet's try a different offer:\n\nOffer 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to Player 2. This gives me:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units, Value to me = 2 * 5 = 10\n- Item 2: 5 units, Value to me = 5 * 9 = 45\n- Item 3: 3 units, Value to me = 3 * 1 = 3\n- Item 4: 5 units, Value to me = 5 * 5 = 25\n- Item 5: 0 units, Value to me = 0 * 1 = 0\n\n**Total Value to Me** = 10 + 45 + 3 + 25 + 0 = 83\n\nThis value approaches the outside offer under a heavier negotiation angle but might be worth testing player 2's valuation of item 3.

One reasonable counteroffer is to offer the other side a bundle that is \u201conly slightly\u201d less attractive than what they had previously had (so they might be willing to accept) while giving me more of the high\u2010value items. For example, if I propose to give Player 1 the bundle [1, 3, 1, 3, 1] then my allocation becomes the complement:\n\u2003My allocation = Total \u2013 Offer = [1\u20131, 7\u20133, 1\u20131, 7\u20133, 3\u20131] = [0, 4, 0, 4, 2].\n\nLet\u2019s check my raw value:\n\u2003item 1: 0\u00d76 = 0\n\u2003item 2: 4\u00d710 = 40\n\u2003item 3: 0\u00d74 = 0\n\u2003item 4: 4\u00d77 = 28\n\u2003item 5: 2\u00d710 = 20\n\u2003Total = 40 + 28 + 20 = 88.\n\nThe effective (discounted) value is 88\u00d70.9 = 79.2, which beats my outside offer (74).\n\nBy giving Player 1 [1, 3, 1, 3, 1] my proposal does require that they give up on some items relative to the previous split ([1, 4, 1, 4, 2]). In particular, they would see a reduction in items 2 and 5. (Those are the items I value highly, and I assume that if the trade were to occur they could be close to indifferent or find their outside option acceptable.) \n\nBecause 79.2 is clearly better for me than 54.9 and (if accepted) I gain considerably more of my high\u2010value items, my counteroffer is to give Player 1 [1, 3, 1, 3, 1].\n\nThus, my response is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,3,1,3,1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 82. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 81 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 5, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 5, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

That means even if I could secure all items (raw value 85), the discounted value would be 76.5, which is below my outside offer of 82.\n\nThe current offer [0, 1, 5, 1, 1] would give me a raw value of:\n\u2003item 1: 0\u00d710 = 0\n\u2003item 2: 1\u00d76 = 6\n\u2003item 3: 5\u00d73 = 15\n\u2003item 4: 1\u00d77 = 7\n\u2003item 5: 1\u00d71 = 1\nTotal = 29, and discounted that is 0.9 \u00d7 29 = 26.1.\n\nClearly no division of items can improve on the fact that the maximum raw value is 85 (discounted to 76.5) which is below the guaranteed 82 from my outside option.\n\nTherefore, I must WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 39. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 120 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Compare current offer value to my outside offer (worth 39).\n\nSince 19 < 39, accepting this offer is not favorable compared to my outside offer. Therefore, it does not make sense to accept this offer.\n\n**Considering a COUNTEROFFER:**\n\nMy goal is to find a counteroffer where the value of the items I keep is greater than 39 (my outside offer).\n\nLet's try a counteroffer to maximize my value:\n- Assume I keep all of item 1 and item 2 for myself and offer minimal other items to Player 2.\n\nHypothetical counteroffer [0, 0, 1, 1, 1], meaning I keep:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nMy value from this hypothetical division:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n\nTotal value = 20 + 18 + 6 + 27 + 27 = 98\n\n98 > 39, so this is a feasible counteroffer.

I ideally want to maintain or improve my value from the negotiation and propose a split they will accept, but since the current adjusted value is better than my outside offer, a better counteroffer can still be attempted.\n\n### Potential Counteroffer\nI could aim for a split that slightly increases my value by taking more of the highest value item for me, item 3 (which is very valuable for me\u2014value of 10 per unit):\n\nLet's propose: [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n- I keep 1 unit of item 1 (value = 7)\n- I keep 2 units of item 2 (value = 12)\n- I keep 3 units of item 3 (value = 30, since I would take one less from the offer)\n- I keep 2 units of item 4 (value = 6)\n- I keep 3 units of item 5 (value = 3, since I would take one more)\n\nNew total value for me = 7 + 12 + 30 + 6 + 3 = 58\n\nApplying the discount for this round = 58 * 0.9 = 52.2\n\nThis value (52.2) is above the 42.3 from accepting the current offer.\n\n### Decision\nGiven this calculation, a counteroffer is worth proposing since it increases my value further while still being realistic.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

If the offer isn't entertained, I'll have a chance to decide whether to accept the finalized offer in the next round or walk away.\n\nThus, my action is to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",
