                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 11.\n    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 6 for item 3, 9 for item 4, 7 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 136. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 39. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 39. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 96 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 4 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 9 x 2 + 7 x 2\n    which is 38 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 39. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 84. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 84. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 84 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 7 x 1 + 5 x 4 + 9 x 6 + 2 x 1\n    which is 83 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 84. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 70. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 111 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 10 x 3 + 9 x 3 + 6 x 2\n    which is 69 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 70. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 9. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 9. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 90 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 9 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 1 x 1\n    which is 7 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 9. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 42. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 42. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 75 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 7 x 5\n    which is 41 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 42. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 4 x 1 + 1 x 4 + 8 x 3\n    which is 32 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 33. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Therefore, I need to propose an initial offer that maximizes my total value.\n   \n   - A potential counteroffer strategy should ensure my obtained value exceeds my outside offer (33). \n\n   - To formulate a beneficial initial offer, I should start with retaining items that give me higher value and offer others that might hold less value for me:\n\n     - Retain: \n       - Item 5 (8 value per unit), because it has high value for me.\n       - Item 2 (8 value per unit), keep it all if possible, as it provides a high value.\n     - Partially offer:\n       - Item 3 and Item 4 due to their moderate value.\n     - Full or high offering:\n       - Item 1, as it has the least value to me.\n\n   Based on this reasoning, here\u2019s a potential division of offers:\n\n   Suppose, I give:\n   - Item 1: 4 units (all)\n   - Item 2: 0 units (none)\n   - Item 3: 1 unit\n   - Item 4: 3 units\n   - Item 5: 0 units (none)\n\n   And I keep:\n   - Item 1: 0 units\n   - Item 2: 1 unit\n   - Item 3: 3 units\n   - Item 4: 3 units\n   - Item 5: 3 units\n\n   Calculate my value for keeping these items:\n   - Value from Item 1: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   - Value from Item 2: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n   - Value from Item 3: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n   - Value from Item 4: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n   - Value from Item 5: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n   - Total value = 47\n\n   This strategy offers me a value of 47, which beats my outside offer of 33 and thus is advantageous. This avoids Mistake 2 (offering less than my outside offer).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since there is no current offer to accept and my calculated offer is better than my outside offer, I should proceed with the initial proposed counteroffer.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, here is my action:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 1, 3, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 96. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 93 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 4 x 1 + 7 x 5 + 8 x 5 + 8 x 2\n    which is 95 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 96. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 6, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 10 x 6 + 2 x 3 + 9 x 1\n    which is 75 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 76. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

Accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n3) Decision Making:\n   - Accepting the current offer is not viable as it yields much less value than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away allows me to secure the value of my outside offer, which is higher than the current offer.\n   - A counteroffer should be considered; however, I need a division that gives me more than my outside offer's value. None of the previous negotiations led to a better offer for me than my outside offer.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most rational decision is to walk away because it secures a higher value than the current offer and potential offers. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 6, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 2 x 2 + 8 x 4 + 2 x 6 + 6 x 6\n    which is 84 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 85. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my initial offer, I will first analyze the situation based on the guidelines provided:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis**:\n   - My outside offer value is 85.\n   - The values of the items for me are:\n     - Item 1: 5\n     - Item 2: 2\n     - Item 3: 8\n     - Item 4: 2\n     - Item 5: 6\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor reduces the value of future rounds, making early resolutions potentially more valuable.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of Offers**:\n   - I need to propose a division where the value of what I keep is more than 85.\n   - Here's a calculation for one potential offer where I propose giving Player 2 [1, 0, 1, 3, 3]:\n     - My share is [2, 3, 3, 3, 3], giving me a value of:\n       - 5 x 2 = 10 (Item 1)\n       - 2 x 3 = 6 (Item 2)\n       - 8 x 3 = 24 (Item 3)\n       - 2 x 3 = 6 (Item 4)\n       - 6 x 3 = 18 (Item 5)\n     - Total value = 10 + 6 + 24 + 6 + 18 = 64\n     - This value is less than my outside offer of 85, so I need to adjust.\n\n   - Another potential option: Offering Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 2, 4]:\n     - My share becomes [2, 2, 3, 4, 2]:\n       - 5 x 2 = 10 (Item 1)\n       - 2 x 2 = 4 (Item 2)\n       - 8 x 3 = 24 (Item 3)\n       - 2 x 4 = 8 (Item 4)\n       - 6 x 2 = 12 (Item 5)\n     - Total value = 58 (still less than my outside offer of 85).\n\n   - Yet another option: Offering Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 4]:\n     - My share becomes [2, 2, 3, 5, 2]:\n       - 5 x 2 = 10 (Item 1)\n       - 2 x 2 = 4 (Item 2)\n       - 8 x 3 = 24 (Item 3)\n       - 2 x 5 = 10 (Item 4)\n       - 6 x 2 = 12 (Item 5)\n     - Total value = 10 + 4 + 24 + 10 + 12 = 60\n\n3) **Decision**:\n   - None of the above configurations gives me a value more than my outside offer of 85. I need to find a division that yields more than 85 for me.\n\nGiven the constraints above, I'll make a counteroffer that maximizes my value while still logically providing room for negotiation. I will make a potential counteroffer:\n\nLet's offer Player 2 [0, 0, 1, 3, 5], where my share becomes [3, 3, 3, 3, 1]:\n   - 5 x 3 = 15 (Item 1)\n   - 2 x 3 = 6 (Item 2)\n   - 8 x 3 = 24 (Item 3)\n   - 2 x 3 = 6 (Item 4)\n   - 6 x 1 = 6 (Item 5)\n   - Total value = 57, still not preferable, but this scenario gives the other side more items to reconsider a counteroffer higher than my fallback.\n\nSince I cannot find an offer that achieves more than 64 without risking a walk from negotiations, I will proceed with a minimal counteroffer, hoping Player 2 makes a counteroffer closer to the value of my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 2, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 75. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 87 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 7 x 1 + 5 x 5 + 3 x 4 + 10 x 3\n    which is 74 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 75. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 53. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 102 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 10 x 0 + 9 x 5 + 3 x 0 + 7 x 1\n    which is 52 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 53. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 4, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 1 + 6 x 0 + 6 x 4 + 1 x 0 + 5 x 1\n    which is 33 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 34. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 5 x 3 + 6 x 3 + 4 x 4 + 6 x 5\n    which is 79 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 80. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 4, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 9 x 7 + 3 x 4 + 1 x 4 + 5 x 3\n    which is 94 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 95. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "1) **Analyzing the Current Situation:**\n\n   - **My outside offer value:** 95\n   - **Values of the items involved:**\n     - Item 1: 3\n     - Item 2: 9\n     - Item 3: 3\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 5\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - Item 1: 5 units\n     - Item 2: 7 units\n     - Item 3: 5 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 3 units\n   - **Current offer available:** [0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n   The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) would slightly decrease the present value of later round outcomes, but maximizing value in round 2 is still crucial.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of the Current Offer:**\n\n   - **Current offer: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0]**\n     - Value to me: \n       - 0 units of item 1 gives 0 value\n       - 7 units of item 2 gives 7 \u00d7 9 = 63\n       - 0 units of item 3 gives 0 value\n       - 0 units of item 4 gives 0 value\n       - 0 units of item 5 gives 0 value\n     - Total value = 63\n\n   The total value of accepting this offer is 63, which is less than my outside offer of 95.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n\n   - **Current Offer vs. Outside Offer:** Accepting the current offer gives a value of 63, which is lower than my outside offer of 95.\n   - Therefore, accepting this offer would conflict with my objective to maximize my outcome and behave in line with mistake 4 and potentially 5.\n   \n   Thus, instead of accepting the current offer, I should propose a counteroffer that has the potential to result in a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n### Calculating a Counteroffer:\n- For example, offering [0, 3, 2, 4, 0] to Player 2 (so I keep [5, 4, 3, 1, 3]) gives me a value:\n  - 5 units of item 1 \u00d7 3 = 15\n  - 4 units of item 2 \u00d7 9 = 36\n  - 3 units of item 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n  - 1 unit of item 4 \u00d7 1 = 1\n  - 3 units of item 5 \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - Total = 76\n\nThis value is still less than my outside offer of 95. Therefore, I need to keep more of high-value items like item 2.\n\n### Final Counteroffer:\n- Another iteration: Offering [3, 3, 2, 4, 0] to Player 2 (so I keep [2, 4, 3, 1, 3]) gives me a value:\n  - 2 units of item 1 \u00d7 3 = 6\n  - 4 units of item 2 \u00d7 9 = 36\n  - 3 units of item 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n  - 1 unit of item 4 \u00d7 1 = 1\n  - 3 units of item 5 \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - Total = 67\n\nStill less than outside offer, let's adjust again.\n\nOffering [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2 (keeping [4, 7, 5, 5, 3] myself) gives me a value:\n- 4 units of item 1 \u00d7 3 = 12\n- 7 units of item 2 \u00d7 9 = 63\n- 5 units of item 3 \u00d7 3 = 15\n- 5 units of item 4 \u00d7 1 = 5\n- 3 units of item 5 \u00d7 5 = 15\n- Total = 110\n\nSince this is more than my outside offer, I will propose it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

In the third round, no discount will apply since it's the decision round for me.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n**Current Offer**: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n- My value if I accept the current offer will be:\n  - Item 1: 0 x 3 = 0\n  - Item 2: 7 x 9 = 63\n  - Item 3: 0 x 3 = 0\n  - Item 4: 0 x 1 = 0\n  - Item 5: 0 x 5 = 0\n  - Total value = 63\n\nComparing 63 to my outside offer value of 95, the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n**Counteroffer Evaluation**:\n\nTo ensure I receive a value greater than 95, let me try formulating a possible counteroffer where I keep a specific division of items to surpass an internal value of 95. \n\nSupposing I keep:\n- Item 1: 5 units (entirety)\n- Item 2: 0 units\n- Item 3: 5 units (entirety)\n- Item 4: 5 units (entirety)\n- Item 5: 3 units (entirety)\n  \nThis would require offering Player 2 ([0, 7, 0, 0, 0]), which is already on the table, but does not work because it's a prior offer from Player 2.\n\nLet's consider a better counteroffer:\n\nSuppose I offer Player 2:\n- Item 1: 0 units \n- Item 2: 7 units \n- Item 3: 0 units\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 0 units\n\nMy kept items would value:\n- Item 1: 5 x 3 = 15\n- Item 2: 0 x 9 = 0\n- Item 3: 5 x 3 = 15\n- Item 4: 5 x 1 = 5\n- Item 5: 3 x 5 = 15\n \nTotal value = 15 + 0 + 15 + 5 + 15 = 50, which still is below my desired threshold.\n\nThus, ensure the kept division should be adjusted properly, taking care to maximize return above 95. But since we're in round 3, the counteroffer will be a walk.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nGiven that any negotiation in round 3 leads to a walk by the game mechanics, and given none formulated counteroffers give a greater value than my outside offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 73. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 73. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 57 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 2, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 3 + 1 x 4 + 4 x 2 + 5 x 3 + 6 x 6\n    which is 72 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 73. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Let's calculate a distribution: \n\n- If I propose giving [3, 1, 1, 1, 2] items to Player 2, I keep [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]:\n  - My value will be: \n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n    - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 1 = 5\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n    - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n  - Total value = 9 + 5 + 4 + 10 + 24 = 52\n\nThis value is lower than 73. Let's try a different division to maximise my objective:\n\n- If I propose giving [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] items to Player 2, keeping [4, 5, 1, 2, 5] for myself:\n  - My value will be:\n    - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n    - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 1 = 5\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n    - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n  - Total value = 12 + 5 + 4 + 10 + 30 = 61\n\n61 is still less than my outside offer of 73. Let's continue iterating:\n\n- If I give Player 2 [2, 2, 1, 1, 1] and keep [4, 4, 1, 2, 5]:\n  - My value will be:\n    - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n    - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 1 = 4\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n    - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n  - Total value = 12 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 30 = 60\n\nStill below 73. Iteratively adjusting, we find a better proportion:\n\n- If I propose giving [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (unacceptable as per mistake rules), then the value calculation would continue reformulating a more satisfactory counteroffer:\n\nA viable counteroffer keeping maximal value could be recalculated up to the point where the effective alternative can prevail:\n\nUntil revisualization uncovers a better, non-recursive calculation to satisfy 73+. Let's revisit:\n\nGiven recalculations, essentially reassessing let me propose a viable counteroffer that exceeds this baseline thus an interactive mechanic:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 0, 0]}\n\nOnce confirmed evaluation displays validly reaching 73+ voor selfsatisfying equitable self-proposals based on prior ilk.",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 6, 2, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 5 + 1 x 6 + 5 x 2 + 5 x 3 + 7 x 6\n    which is 118 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 119. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "My analysis:\n1. My outside offer (fallback) is 119 (undiscounted). In round 2, any deal reached will be discounted by 0.9 (since gamma^(2\u20131)=0.9). This means even if I received all the items (total raw value 127), my effective value would be 127\u00d70.9 = 114.3, which is below my fallback of 119.\n\n2. The current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]. That would give me:\n\u2003\u2022 0\u00d79 (item 1) = 0\n\u2003\u2022 0\u00d71 (item 2) = 0\n\u2003\u2022 0\u00d75 (item 3) = 0\n\u2003\u2022 0\u00d75 (item 4) = 0\n\u2003\u2022 6\u00d77 (item 5) = 42\n\u2003Total raw value = 42, discounted to 42\u00d70.9 = 37.8, which is far less than my fallback of 119.\n\n3. Considering any counteroffer I might propose: Because even obtaining all items yields a discounted value of only 114.3, no division can secure more than my outside offer. In addition, offering myself anything less than full allocation would only result in a lower value. Since my objective is to guarantee a value at least as high as 119, any negotiated deal in round 2 would be worse than walking away.\n\n4. Therefore, based on these calculations and to avoid mistakes like accepting or proposing an offer that runs below my guaranteed fallback, my best action is to WALK away.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Here\u2019s how I will approach this:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is worth 55.\n- **Values of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 3 per unit\n  - Item 2: 8 per unit\n  - Item 3: 8 per unit\n  - Item 4: 10 per unit\n  - Item 5: 4 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\nMaximum Value of all items = \\(3 \\times 4 + 8 \\times 1 + 8 \\times 3 + 10 \\times 5 + 4 \\times 1 = 12 + 8 + 24 + 50 + 4 = 98\\). \n\n- **Discount Factor:** Initially irrelevant for the first round as we would not have incurred any rounds of discount yet. However, if the process is delayed, values are reduced by the factor of \\(0.9^r-1\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\nThere\u2019s no current offer to analyze, so I must determine a counteroffer that maximizes my value above my outside offer of 55. \n\nI'll aim for at least 55 in value to avoid Mistake 2 and Mistake 5. I'll start with some potential offers that surpass the outside offer value due to the fact that I can't see what player 2's private values are, so maximizing my value without knowing theirs is a bit of a guess.\n\nGiven my item values, let\u2019s design an advantageous offer:\n\nTo aim to keep the following items:\n- 2 units of item 1 = \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\)\n- 1 unit of item 2 = \\(8 \\times 1 = 8\\)\n- 2 units of item 3 = \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\)\n- 4 units of item 4 = \\(10 \\times 4 = 40\\)\n- 1 unit of item 5 = \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n\nThe value I gain here is \\(6 + 8 + 16 + 40 + 4 = 74\\).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nThe total for this configuration is 74, which is comfortably above my outside offer of 55.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 9 x 5 + 4 x 1\n    which is 49 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 52. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 10 x 5 + 4 x 1\n    which is 54 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 55. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 9 x 3 + 4 x 3 + 8 x 1 + 3 x 3\n    which is 56 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 57. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [5, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

In round 2 the discount factor is 0.9 so if I reach an agreement in this round my raw value is multiplied by 0.9. This means I need a raw value of at least 43/0.9 \u2248 47.8 (i.e. 48 or more) to beat my outside offer.\n\n2. My private values for the items are: item1 = 3, item2 = 1, item3 = 5, item4 = 6, item5 = 5. The total pool of items is [5, 4, 4, 1, 4] so that the total raw value if I got everything would be:\n\u2003\u20033\u00d75 + 1\u00d74 + 5\u00d74 + 6\u00d71 + 5\u00d74 = 15 + 4 + 20 + 6 + 20 = 65.\nWhen I propose a counteroffer (as Player 2) I specify what to give to Player 1; I retain the remainder. Thus if I offer Player 1 an allocation [a, b, c, d, e], then my share is:\n\u2003\u2003[5\u2013a, 4\u2013b, 4\u2013c, 1\u2013d, 4\u2013e],\nand my raw value is:\n\u2003\u2003(5\u2013a)*3 + (4\u2013b)*1 + (4\u2013c)*5 + (1\u2013d)*6 + (4\u2013e)*5 = 65 \u2013 (3a + b + 5c + 6d + 5e).\nTo beat my fallback, I need 65 \u2013 (3a + b + 5c + 6d + 5e) \u2265 48, i.e. 3a + b + 5c + 6d + 5e \u2264 17.\n\n3. The current offer on the table by Player 1 would give me [2, 1, 3, 0, 0]. Calculating my value from that:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d73 + 1\u00d71 + 3\u00d75 + 0\u00d76 + 0\u00d75 = 6 + 1 + 15 = 22.\nDiscounted in round 2: 22\u00d70.9 = 19.8, which is far below my outside offer of 43.\n\n4. To maximize my value, I want to retain as much as possible. However, I must avoid \u201cmistake 3\u201d (offering nothing to the opponent early or middle rounds), so I should concede a minimal amount. One natural idea is to make a counteroffer that gives a very small amount (ideally an item that is of low value to me).\n\n5. For example, if I offer Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] then my retained share is:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 5, item 2: 4\u20131 = 3, item 3: 4, item 4: 1, item 5: 4.\nMy raw value then is:\n\u2003\u20035\u00d73 + 3\u00d71 + 4\u00d75 + 1\u00d76 + 4\u00d75 = 15 + 3 + 20 + 6 + 20 = 64.\nDiscounted value is 64\u00d70.9 = 57.6, which is much greater than my fallback of 43.\nAlso, the \u201ccost\u201d of the offer (3\u00d70 + 1\u00d71 + 5\u00d70 + 6\u00d70 + 5\u00d70 = 1) is well within the allowed concession (at most 17).\n\n6.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 107. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 107. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 4, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 1 + 5 x 4 + 10 x 4 + 1 x 5 + 8 x 4\n    which is 106 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 107. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 4, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 1 + 5 x 4 + 10 x 4 + 1 x 5 + 8 x 4\n    which is 106 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 107. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 4, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, I will follow the structured approach:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** 107\n   - **Values of the Items:**\n     - Item 1: 9 per unit\n     - Item 2: 5 per unit\n     - Item 3: 10 per unit\n     - Item 4: 1 per unit\n     - Item 5: 8 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 3 units\n     - Item 2: 5 units\n     - Item 3: 4 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 4 units\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** Since we are in round 2, the discount factor (gamma) is 0.9 for the present value of the negotiation outcome. The effective value of the outcome needs to be calculated by multiplying the round value by 0.9, and it should be compared with the outside offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] (I am being offered this)\n     - My value for this offer:\n       - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n       - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n       - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n       - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n     - Total value = 5 + 1 = 6\n     - Effective value (considering discount): 6 \u00d7 0.9 = 5.4\n\n   The value of the current offer to me (5.4) is significantly less than my outside offer value of 107. Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Since the current offer undervalues my position as compared to my outside offer, I should not accept it.\n   - I should not walk away yet to maximize my outcome using further rounds.\n   - An attractive counteroffer would be to offer less to Player 2 and keep items with high value to me.\n\n   Let's calculate a potential counteroffer:\n   - Try keeping all the units I value highly:\n     - Item 1: 3\n     - Item 2: 5 - x\n     - Item 3: 4\n     - Item 4: y (offer minimal here since its value is low)\n     - Item 5: 4\n   \n   Start with offering the minimal units of lower valued items and assess:\n   - Offer for Item 2: 0 (keeping 5 which maximizes my value)\n   - Offer for Item 4: 5 (as it holds the least value for me)\n\n   Calculating my value:\n   - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n   - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 5 = 25\n   - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n   - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n   - Total value I receive = 27 + 25 + 40 + 0 + 32 = 124\n\n   124 is greater than my outside offer of 107, thus represents a suitable counteroffer.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n   Based on this analysis, my action is:\n\n   ```json\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]}\n   ```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "My analysis is as follows:\n\n1. Current situation:\n\u2003\u2022 My outside offer is 76 (guaranteed value if I walk away).\n\u2003\u2022 My per\u2010unit values are: item1 = 3, item2 = 5, item3 = 1, item4 = 10, item5 = 8.\n\u2003\u2022 The total available items are: [3, 5, 4, 5, 4].\n\u2003\u2022 In round 2 the discount factor is 0.9 (since r = 2, discount = 0.9^(2\u20131)=0.9). Thus if a deal closes now, my raw value is multiplied by 0.9. In other words, to beat my outside offer I must obtain a raw (undiscounted) value higher than about 76/0.9 \u2248 84.44. (For safety I want my raw value to be comfortably higher than ~85 so that even after discount I beat 76.)\n\n2. Assessment of offers:\n\u2003\u2022 The current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]. If I accept it, I get:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 0\u00d73 + 0\u00d75 + 0\u00d71 + 5\u00d710 + 0\u00d78 = 50 raw value.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Adjusted by the discount: 50\u00d70.9 = 45.\n\u2003\u2003This is much lower than my outside offer of 76.\n\u2003\u2022 Thus, I must counteroffer.\n\u2003\u2022 A counteroffer is made by specifying what I give to Player\u00a01; I keep the remaining items.\n\u2003\u2022 Let S = [s1, s2, s3, s4, s5] denote what I keep and O = [total \u2013 s1, total \u2013 s2, \u2026] be the offer to Player\u00a01.\n\u2003\u2022 I want to keep a bundle that gives me a raw value \u2265 roughly 85. Noting my high\u2010values, I want to keep all of items 4 and 5 (worth 50 and 32 respectively) which sum to 82. I then need a few additional points from the lower\u2010value items.\n\u2003\u2022 For example, if I keep 1 unit of item1 (adding 3 points) and all of item2 (adding 25), my total would be even higher (3 + 25 + 50 + 32 = 110 raw) which discounted would be 99. But that might be too extreme from the opponent\u2019s perspective.\n\u2003\u2022 A more balanced idea is to concede a little from item2. For instance, if I propose to keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item1: 1 unit (3 points)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item2: 4 units (20 points)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item3: 0 units (0 points; since item3 is very low value for me, I can concede all 4 units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item4: all 5 units (50 points)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item5: all 4 units (32 points)\n\u2003\u2003Then my raw total is 3 + 20 + 0 + 50 + 32 = 105 (which discounts to 94.5). This is well above my fallback.\n\u2003\u2022 The corresponding counteroffer (the items I give to Player\u00a01) is the complement:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 3 \u2212 1 = 2 units\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 5 \u2212 4 = 1 unit\n\u2003\u2003Item3: 4 \u2212 0 = 4 units\n\u2003\u2003Item4: 5 \u2212 5 = 0 units\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 4 \u2212 4 = 0 units\n\u2003\u2022 That counteroffer is [2, 1, 4, 0, 0]. It avoids the mistakes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I am not proposing an offer that gives me less than my fallback (105 raw is well above the needed ~85).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I avoid giving away all or no items in any category.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I ensure that I retain my most valuable items and give up lower valued ones.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 And this offer is better than the current offer on the table.\n\n3. Decision:\n\u2003\u2022 Since the current offer gives me only 45 (after discount) and is much worse than my fallback of 76, I will not ACCEPT.\n\u2003\u2022 I also do not want to WALK since I can improve my outcome with a counteroffer.\n\u2003\u2022 I therefore propose the counteroffer [2, 1, 4, 0, 0] (which means I am offering Player\u00a01 2 of item1, 1 of item2, 4 of item3, and nothing of items 4 and 5).\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 0, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 4 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 10 x 0 + 7 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my action in this negotiation, I need to follow a structured approach:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1.\n2. **Values of the Items**:\n   - Item 1: 5 per unit\n   - Item 2: 4 per unit\n   - Item 3: 1 per unit\n   - Item 4: 10 per unit\n   - Item 5: 7 per unit\n3. **Total Pool of Items**:\n   - 3 units of Item 1\n   - 2 units of Item 2\n   - 4 units of Item 3\n   - 3 units of Item 4\n   - 4 units of Item 5\n4. **Discount Factor**: As we're in the first round, the discount factor does not apply immediately. It will influence the value in subsequent rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer from Player 2, I will consider potential initial offers. The goal is to maximize my total value while also presenting a realistic and strategic offer, not violating any of the mistakes mentioned.\n\nTo avoid the second mistake\u2014making an offer worse than my outside offer\u2014I need to ensure my retained items result in a value greater than 1.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffer\n\nI will propose an offer to Player 2 that allows me to retain a high value from the remaining items. A strategic initial split could be as follows:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5]\n\nThis means I keep:\n\n- 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n- 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n\n**Total Value for me** = 10 + 4 + 2 + 20 + 14 = 50\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 1.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on the assessment, the proposed counteroffer has a total value of 50, which is much higher than my fallback option of 1.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

Let's go through this step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 1.\n\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 5\n  - Item 2: 4\n  - Item 3: 1\n  - Item 4: 10\n  - Item 5: 7\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5 \n\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** With gamma = 0.9, the value of any offer will be reduced by the discount factor in subsequent rounds. Thus, securing a favorable deal quickly is beneficial.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer (being offered to me): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]**\n  - My total value if I accept it: \n    - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n  - Total value = 4\n  - Since 4 is greater than my outside offer value of 1, I should not walk away.\n\n- **Evaluate potential counteroffers:** I need to ensure that I avoid any mistakes:\n  - **Mistake 2:** Offering something worse than my outside offer.\n  - **Mistake 4:** Accepting less than my fallback (outside offer value).\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\n- The current offer gives me a value of 4, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 1.\n  \n- **Action Decision:**\n  - The offer on the table has a higher value than my outside offer of 1.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

In round 2, any negotiated division is discounted by a factor of 0.9 (since gamma^(round-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9). Even if we got the whole pie (which is the maximum we can achieve), our discounted value would be 108\u00d70.9 = 97.2.\n5. The current offer on the table is [3, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This would give us:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 units \u2192 30 points\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 units \u2192 12 points\n\u2003Total undiscounted = 42, and discounted value = 42\u00d70.9 = 37.8.\n6. Any counteroffer we could propose would only reallocate the total items available (108 maximum) but, after applying the discount, even the best-case scenario (getting all items) would yield 97.2.\n7. Since 97.2 is below our fallback of 106, accepting any division or negotiating further in this round yields a worse outcome than our outside offer.\n8. Therefore, to maximize our payoff, we should WALK away from the negotiation and secure our outside offer of 106.\n\nFinal action:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 148. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 105 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 9, 3, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 10 x 9 + 10 x 3 + 5 x 3 + 2 x 6\n    which is 147 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 148. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 56. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 108 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 10 x 1 + 10 x 4 + 4 x 1\n    which is 54 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 56. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 73. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 60 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 4, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 6 x 3 + 6 x 5 + 3 x 4 + 2 x 6\n    which is 72 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 73. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 0, 4, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 0, 4, 6]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "My reasoning:\n\n1. My outside offer is 73.

Thus, accepting is not acceptable.\n\n2. I can counteroffer. My total value if I received every unit would be 102. In any counteroffer I make (i.e. by offering a list [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] to Player 1), my share is given by subtracting those numbers from the total available. My share\u2019s value is then computed as:  \n\u2003\u20033\u00d7(2\u2013a1) + 6\u00d7(7\u2013a2) + 6\u00d7(5\u2013a3) + 3\u00d7(4\u2013a4) + 2\u00d7(6\u2013a5).  \nTo be at least as good as my fallback, I need my share value to be \u226573. Equivalently, the lost value (i.e. the value from items I give away) should be \u2264102 \u2013 73 = 29.\n\n3. I want to maximize my outcome. At the same time, I must offer Player 1 something that might tempt them to settle rather than waiting for their unknown outside offer. I wish to avoid \u201cMistake 2\u201d (offering a deal that leaves me with less than 73) and \u201cMistake 5\u201d (walking away from a deal that is better than my fallback). \n\n4. I considered a potential counteroffer [1,1,0,1,2]. In this proposal:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The offered (given away) items have a \u201ccost\u201d for me of:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 1: 1\u00d73 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1\u00d76 = 6  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0\u00d76 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 1\u00d73 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2\u00d72 = 4  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Total concession = 3 + 6 + 0 + 3 + 4 = 16, which is well within the maximum of 29.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 My resulting share becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2\u20131 = 1 unit \u2192 1\u00d73 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 2: 7\u20131 = 6 units \u2192 6\u00d76 = 36  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 3: 5\u20130 = 5 units \u2192 5\u00d76 = 30  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 4\u20131 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d73 = 9  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 5: 6\u20132 = 4 units \u2192 4\u00d72 = 8  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Total = 3 + 36 + 30 + 9 + 8 = 86  \nThis gives me a value of 86, which is comfortably above my outside offer of 73 while keeping my concessions minimal.\n\n5.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 3 x 2 + 4 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 10 x 0\n    which is 6 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 7. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 68. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 57 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 2, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 1 + 2 x 5 + 8 x 2 + 1 x 3 + 6 x 6\n    which is 67 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 68. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision regarding the initial offer, I will evaluate the situation as follows:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 68.\n   - My values per unit are: \n     - Item 1: 2\n     - Item 2: 2\n     - Item 3: 8\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 6\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) affects future offers by reducing their value by 10% per round. Therefore, a better outcome in the current round is preferable unless strategic considerations suggest otherwise.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that meets or exceeds my outside offer value.\n\n   Let's consider keeping 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. This leaves 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 for Player 2.\n\n   This means my value would be calculated as follows:\n   - 5 units of item 1 = 5 x 2 = 10\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 x 2 = 8\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 8 = 16\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 x 1 = 3\n   - 4 units of item 5 = 4 x 6 = 24\n\n   Total value to me = 10 + 8 + 16 + 3 + 24 = 61\n\n   My goal is to get at least 68 to match my outside offer. Since 61 is less, I need to adjust:\n\n   Instead, consider keeping 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5:\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 x 2 = 8\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 x 2 = 8\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 8 = 16\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 1 = 2\n   - 5 units of item 5 = 5 x 6 = 30\n\n   Total value to me = 8 + 8 + 16 + 2 + 30 = 64\n\n   Still below my outside offer of 68, so adjust further:\n\n   Now consider keeping 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. This leaves 3, 2, 0, 1, 1 for Player 2.\n\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 x 2 = 6\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 x 2 = 6\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 8 = 16\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 x 1 = 3\n   - 5 units of item 5 = 5 x 6 = 30\n\n   Total value to me = 6 + 6 + 16 + 3 + 30 = 61\n\n   Again slightly below 68 but altering could lead to a balanced approach considering unseen opponent priorities. Adjust:\n\n   Now consider keeping 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. This leaves 2, 2, 0, 1, 1 for Player 2.\n\n   - 4 units of item 1 = 4 x 2 = 8\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 x 2 = 6\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 8 = 16\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 x 1 = 3\n   - 5 units of item 5 = 5 x 6 = 30\n\n   Total value to me = 8 + 6 + 16 + 3 + 30 = 63\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   None of the attempts provide me value equal or exceeding my outside offer of 68, hence a slight leaning towards securing strategy seems beneficial.\n\n   Final adjustment:\n\n   Keep:\n   - 5 of item 1\n   - 4 of item 2\n   - 2 of item 3\n   - 1 of item 4\n   - 4 of item 5\n\n   Calculation:\n   - 5 * 2 = 10\n   - 4 * 2 = 8\n   - 2 * 8 = 16\n   - 1 * 1 = 1\n   - 4 * 6 = 24\n\n   Total: 59, still less than 68.\n\nOn reevaluation while proposing a moderate balanced deal: (keeping items more for self yet eslint)\n- 4 of item 1\n- 3 of item 2\n- 1 of item 3\n- 1 of item 4\n- 3 of item 5. This leaves 2, 2, 1, 3, 3 for Player 2.\n\nCalculate final:\n- 4 x 2 = 8\n- 3 x 2 = 6\n- 1 x 8 = 8\n- 1 x 1 = 1\n- 3 x 6 = 18\nFinal value : 49.\n\nPer such calculations align fit:\n- 3 of item 1\n- 2 of item 2\n- 1 of item 3\n- 2 of item 4\n- 2 of item 5. ( offer keeps balance moderately at round one)\n\nThus leading towards immediate launch: \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 1, 2, 3]}",

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I'll follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 68.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 2 per unit\n     - Item 2: 2 per unit\n     - Item 3: 8 per unit\n     - Item 4: 1 per unit\n     - Item 5: 6 per unit\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - Item 1: 6 units\n     - Item 2: 5 units\n     - Item 3: 2 units\n     - Item 4: 4 units\n     - Item 5: 6 units\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, meaning future values will be discounted. If I reach the third round, the effective value of the final outcome would be multiplied by 0.9. Thus, this influences making it more appealing to reach a resolution sooner rather than later, all else being equal.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: [0, 5, 0, 0, 6]\n     - Value to me: \n       - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n       - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n       - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n       - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n       - Item 5: 6 \u00d7 6 = 36\n     - Total value = 46, which is less than my outside offer of 68.\n\n   - Counteroffers need to be crafted to yield more than 68 units of value to me, considering the entirety of items to calculate appropriate divisions. For example, if I keep:\n\n     - 6 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5:\n       - Item 1: 6 \u00d7 2 = 12\n       - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n       - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n       - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n     - Total value = 31, which is even less than the current offer and still significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer value (46) is substantially less than my outside offer value (68), and any reasonable configuration of a counteroffer still falls short of my outside offer, an optimal strategy is to propose a counteroffer that allows me to achieve more than my outside offer through a balanced division that also appeals to Player 2.\n\nThus, I will propose a new counteroffer:\n\n- Proposal, where I give Player 2 [1, 2, 0, 2, 6]:\n  - I keep: [5, 3, 2, 2, 0]\n    - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n    - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n    - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n  - Total value = 34\n\nThe counteroffer improves my position to a valued threshold aimed to enable me potentially exceed my outside offer when discounted, therefore aligning with my objectives to maximize end gains through reaching a mutually optimal early settlement. \n\nTherefore, I will provide the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 6]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 102. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 102. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 108 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 2, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 6 x 5 + 7 x 2 + 9 x 3 + 5 x 6\n    which is 101 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 102. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 162. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 114 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 3, 6, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 7 + 9 x 3 + 10 x 6 + 6 x 3 + 9 x 3\n    which is 160 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 162. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Step 1 \u2013 Current Situation:\n\u2022 My outside offer is 162.\n\u2022 My per\u2010unit values are: item1 = 4, item2 = 9, item3 = 10, item4 = 6, item5 = 9.\n\u2022 The total available items are: [7, 3, 6, 4, 3] respectively.\n\u2022 The current offer from Player 1 gives me [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] which is worth 0\u00d74 + 2\u00d79 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 18\u2014far below the fallback of 162.\n\u2022 Because we are in round 1, when a deal is reached the value is multiplied by \u03b3^(r\u20131) = 1; delaying the agreement would subject eventual outcomes to discounting. So it is crucial to get an agreement in round 1 if possible.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Assessing Offers:\n\u2022 If I simply accept Player 1\u2019s offer, I get 18, which is much lower than my outside offer.\n\u2022 I can counteroffer by specifying how many items I give to Player 1; I then keep the rest. My value for the deal is computed as the sum over items: (kept units \u00d7 per\u2010unit value).\n\u2022 If I propose to keep everything ([7,3,6,4,3]), I get 7\u00d74 + 3\u00d79 + 6\u00d710 + 4\u00d76 + 3\u00d79 = 166. However, offering nothing to Player 1 is likely to make them reject the deal.\n\u2022 I must avoid the following mistakes:\n\u2003 Mistake 2: proposing a division that leaves me with less than my outside offer (162).\n\u2003 Mistake 3: offering no items to the other party early on (which is likely to be rejected).\n\u2022 Considering my dispersion of values, item 1 is my \u201ccheapest\u201d since its per\u2010unit value is 4 (the smallest loss when conceding a unit). The maximum total value is 166, so my \u201csurplus\u201d over my fallback is 4 points. Conceding one unit of item 1 (worth 4 to me) would leave me with 166 \u2013 4 = 162, exactly matching my fallback.\n \nStep 3 \u2013 Decision:\n\u2022 In order to give the opponent a nonzero share (and thus encourage acceptance) yet preserve a value at least equal to my outside guarantee, I consider the minimal concession.\n\u2022 A counteroffer of giving Player 1 one unit of item 1 (i.e. offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]) means I keep [7\u20131, 3, 6, 4, 3] = [6, 3, 6, 4, 3] which is worth:\n\u2003 6\u00d74 + 3\u00d79 + 6\u00d710 + 4\u00d76 + 3\u00d79 = 24 + 27 + 60 + 24 + 27 = 162.\n\u2022 This outcome exactly matches my outside offer. Although it is not strictly an improvement, it does meet the requirement of not being worse than my fallback while offering the opponent something (to avoid the pitfall of offering nothing).\n\nThus, my counteroffer is to give Player 1 1 unit of item 1 and nothing from the other items.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 41. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 39 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 5, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 3 + 1 x 4 + 1 x 5 + 1 x 1 + 3 x 3\n    which is 40 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 41. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's follow the step-by-step analysis to make an informed decision:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 41.\n   - My values for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 7\n     - Item 2: 1\n     - Item 3: 1\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 3\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor of 0.9 will decrease the value of any outcomes as the rounds progress. Therefore, I must prioritize reaching a favorable deal early if possible.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   Since there is no offer on the table, I need to formulate a counteroffer:\n\n   My goal is to formulate an offer where my retained items have a total value greater than my outside offer of 41.\n\n   Let's consider the following division:\n\n   - I offer Player 2: [2, 5, 5, 1, 1]\n     which means I retain: [5 (7-2), 0 (5-5), 0 (5-5), 0 (1-1), 2 (3-1)]\n\n   Calculate my total value:\n   - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 7 = 35\n   - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n\n   Total value = 35 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 = 41\n\n   This total value equals my outside offer, and as the game progresses to future rounds, this offer will devalue due to discounting unless I receive a better offer or can counteroffer better.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n   - Since my calculated value from this offer equals my outside offer and considering the time discounting, I would want to push for an offer now that maximizes my retained value compared to the outside offer. Offering slightly more flexibility, however, could increase chances of acceptance or provoke a favorable counteroffer before I am influenced negatively by the discount rate. Thus, I should attempt a counteroffer maximizing my value greater than 41. Making use of a few more favorable calculations for now can tentatively give slightly less of item 1 for long-term gain. \n\n   Recalculate potential: \n\n   - Adjust to offer: [1, 4, 4, 1, 0]\n\n   Retained: [6, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\n   Value:\n   - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n   Total value = 42 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 9 = 53\n\n   Comparing this value, it is significantly higher than the original offer and outside fallback. Thus proactively ensure further groundwork capable of mitigating walks later in negotiations:\n\n   **Action:**\n   \n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 4, 1, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 3 + 10 x 4 + 7 x 3 + 10 x 2 + 10 x 2\n    which is 122 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 123. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Accepting the current offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] would give me only 1 unit of item 2, which is worth 10 (1\u00d710), far below my fallback of 123.\n2. To improve my outcome, I should propose a counteroffer where I keep items whose total value exceeds 123. The full pool is: 5 of item1, 7 of item2, 3 of item3, 2 of item4, and 2 of item5. My per\u2010unit values are: item1 = 7, item2 = 10, item3 = 7, item4 = 10, item5 = 10.\n3. If I give only a minimal number of items to Player 1 (thus not giving nothing, which is a mistake), I can keep nearly everything and achieve a high total value. For example, by offering just 1 unit of one item (and giving nothing in the others), I would keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: all 5 units (value = 5\u00d77 = 35)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: all 7 units (value = 7\u00d710 = 70)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item3: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units (value = 2\u00d77 = 14)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: all 2 units (value = 2\u00d710 = 20)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: all 2 units (value = 2\u00d710 = 20)\n\u2003Total = 35 + 70 + 14 + 20 + 20 = 159, which is comfortably above my outside offer of 123.\n4. This counteroffer avoids the key mistakes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 It is not worse than the current offer.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 It gives me a value better than my outside offer.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 It does not offer nothing to Player 1 (I give 1 unit of item3).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 It does not walk away from a division that would give me more than 123.\n5.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 123. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 132 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 3 + 10 x 4 + 7 x 3 + 10 x 2 + 10 x 2\n    which is 122 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 123. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 6, 3, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 3 + 7 x 6 + 9 x 3 + 8 x 4 + 5 x 0\n    which is 125 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 126. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I'll go through the steps as outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 126.\n   - The values of the items involved for me are: \n     - Item 1: 8\n     - Item 2: 7\n     - Item 3: 9\n     - Item 4: 8\n     - Item 5: 5\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 6 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor affects future offers because waiting incurs a reduction in present value, calculated as the value times \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} \\).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to accept, so I will evaluate potential counteroffers.\n   - I want to propose a counteroffer that results in a total value to me that exceeds my outside offer of 126.\n\n3) **Decision making:**\n   - A potential strategy is to first calculate the total value to me if I offer certain items to Player 2 and keep the rest.\n   - Say, I want to start by keeping as equal a number of high value items to myself as possible, and then give away the lower, lesser valued items. For example, if I keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5, my values are:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n     - Total value = 79\n   - Clearly, this gives a value much less than 126, so I adjust my offer.\n   - Let's try to maximize the items that are more individually valuable. For instance, keeping 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 for myself:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n     - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 7 = 35\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n     - Total value = 123\n   - This is still below my outside offer. A further refined attempt:\n   - If I keep 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5:\n     - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n     - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n     - Total value = 125\n   - Still a bit less than my outside offer. To make a fair proposal and ensure I offer items I value least:\n   \nTherefore, I should propose a counteroffer where I keep a balanced but optimal distribution aiming for at least 126 in value. Let's adjust my strategy:\n\nI should try: Keeping 5 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 1 of item 5: which gives:\n   - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n   - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 7 = 35\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n   - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n   - 1 units of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n   - Total value = 139\n  \nThus, the potential counteroffer I could make would be to offer 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 1 of item 5:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 44. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 45 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 1 x 1 + 2 x 3 + 9 x 4\n    which is 43 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 44. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 44.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 1 per unit\n     - Item 2: 2 per unit\n     - Item 3: 1 per unit\n     - Item 4: 2 per unit\n     - Item 5: 9 per unit\n   - The total pool of items available is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor will reduce the value of acceptance in future rounds. Hence, maximizing value early is generally better.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2.\n   - I will calculate potential counteroffers with a total value greater than 44 to ensure I'm not making a mistake:\n     - One potential counteroffer: Keep as many units of high-value items as possible while offering lower-value items.\n       - Let's consider the division where I keep [2, 0, 1, 2, 3] items, giving Player 2 [2, 2, 5, 3, 3].\n       - My value if I keep [2, 0, 1, 2, 3]:\n         - 2\u00d71 (item 1) = 2\n         - 0\u00d72 (item 2) = 0\n         - 1\u00d71 (item 3) = 1\n         - 2\u00d72 (item 4) = 4\n         - 3\u00d79 (item 5) = 27\n         - Total = 34 \n       - However, this is less than 44, so let's adjust this offer.\n     \n     - Another potential counteroffer: Keep [3, 1, 2, 2, 5] instead, giving Player 2 [1, 1, 4, 3, 1].\n       - My value if I keep [3, 1, 2, 2, 5]:\n         - 3\u00d71 (item 1) = 3\n         - 1\u00d72 (item 2) = 2\n         - 2\u00d71 (item 3) = 2\n         - 2\u00d72 (item 4) = 4\n         - 5\u00d79 (item 5) = 45\n         - Total = 56, which is greater than 44. This is a good offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that maintains a total value greater than my outside offer of 44. This avoids mistakes such as making an offer worse than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 4, 3, 1]}\n```",

Adjust further.\n\nHere's an optimal counteroffer:\n- If I keep 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5, my value would be:\n  - 0 x 5 = 0\n  - 0 x 5 = 0\n  - 7 x 10 = 70\n  - 0 x 6 = 0\n  - 6 x 10 = 60\n- Total value = 130 (still less than 144), hence needs adjustment.\n\nFinal offer adjustment before WALKING:\nLet's keep the entire set of value-achieving items without sending below outside offer:\n- I will keep 2 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 7 of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5, my value would be:\n  - 2 x 5 = 10\n  - 1 x 5 = 5\n  - 7 x 10 = 70\n  - 2 x 6 = 12\n  - 5 x 10 = 50\n- Total value = 147, which finally exceeds the outside offer. \n\nCounteroffer to offer the rest to Player 2 is:\n- 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\nThus, I propose the following:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 3, 0, 1, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 194. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 114 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Therefore, the present value of any accepted offer in round 2 is its actual value (since the negotiation hasn't been concluded yet).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current offer on the table:** [5, 0, 4, 4, 0] (What I would receive)\n     - Value = (5 * 4) + (0 * 6) + (4 * 1) + (4 * 5) + (0 * 8) \n     - Value = 20 + 0 + 4 + 20 + 0 = 44\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** 44 is significantly less than my outside offer of 123.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - Accepting the current offer provides a total value of 44 compared to my outside offer value of 123 (which is better for me).\n   - Walking away will assure me a value of 123.\n   - I should aim for a counteroffer that provides a better value than my outside offer in consideration of any potential future negotiations.\n   \n   Given that the current offer is significantly below my outside offer and I am in round 2 with still room for negotiations or walking away later, I need to make a counteroffer. If I keep all items, my value would be 130.

However, this is a significant value above the current offer towards negotiation resolution.\n\nThe goal is to bridge the gap towards accepting an offer rather than walking away, which might induce the other player towards an offer greater than my fallback.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If accepted, my total value would be 0\u00b74 + 0\u00b73 + 0\u00b76 + 0\u00b710 + 1\u00b78 = 8, which is far below my fallback of 83.\n\u2022 With a discount factor of gamma = 0.9, early deals (in round 1) are not discounted (gamma^(0) = 1), so waiting only harms value if we delay agreement. It is important now to make a counteroffer that gives me a value above 83 if accepted.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Assess the value of offers and propose one:\n\u2022 My value for a deal is calculated based on the items I keep (total items minus what I offer to Player 1). I must make sure that the division I propose gives me a total value strictly greater than 83.\n\u2022 I also want to avoid the mistake of \u201coffering no items\u201d to the opponent in early rounds (mistake 3). Thus, I should give the opponent a nonzero allocation for at least one item.\n\u2022 One candidate offer is to give Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]. Under that division:\n\u2003\u2013 For item 2: I give 1 unit (so I keep 4 \u2013 1 = 3), which is worth 3\u00d73 = 9.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 3: I give 1 unit (so I keep 4 \u2013 1 = 3), worth 3\u00d76 = 18.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 4: I give 0 units (so I keep all 4), worth 4\u00d710 = 40.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 5: I give 0 units (so I keep all 3), worth 3\u00d78 = 24.\n\u2003\u2013 For item 1, there is nothing.\n\u2003Total value for me = 9 + 18 + 40 + 24 = 91.\n\u2022 This total of 91 is above the 83-value fallback, avoiding mistake 2. It is also clearly better than the current offer of 8, so mistake 4 is avoided, and I am not walking away from an offer better than my fallback.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Make a decision:\n\u2022 Since accepting the current offer would yield only 8 (well below my fallback), and walking away guarantees 83, I must propose a counteroffer.\n\u2022 The counteroffer [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] ensures I get a value of 91, protecting my interests and avoiding the outlined negotiation mistakes.\n\nFinal action:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 2 x 2 + 1 x 4 + 4 x 4 + 2 x 3\n    which is 30 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 31. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 3 x 0 + 3 x 2 + 7 x 0 + 5 x 0\n    which is 6 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 7. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 4, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 7.\n   - My values per unit of each item are: item 1 = 7, item 2 = 3, item 3 = 3, item 4 = 7, item 5 = 5.\n   - The total pool of items is [0, 3, 4, 7, 5].\n   - The discount factor (\u03b3 = 0.9) influences the value by reducing it slightly each round. However, since we're in round 2 and the negotiation can conclude here, this doesn't need immediate adjustment for decision-making but may factor into round 3 if necessary.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer (what's offered to me): [0, 0, 4, 0, 0], translating to:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n     - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n     - Total value = 12\n   - Since 12 (current offer) > 7 (outside offer), it's beneficial compared to walking away.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 12, which is higher than my outside offer of 7. Therefore, accepting the current offer is better than walking away. Also, it ensures I am not making mistakes 4 or 5, as I\u2019m accepting an offer better than my outside option.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 9 x 1 + 8 x 0 + 8 x 6\n    which is 63 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 64. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 5, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 5, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I will analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 64.\n- **Values of the Items**: \n  - Item 1: 10 per unit\n  - Item 2: 6 per unit\n  - Item 3: 9 per unit\n  - Item 4: 8 per unit\n  - Item 5: 8 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 8 units of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor of 0.9 makes future offers slightly less valuable, given that we are in round 2 and a decision in round 3 would result in a present value discount.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: [2, 1, 5, 0, 0] is the offer currently on the table, provided by Player 2. I calculate its value to me:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n  - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n  - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n  - Total value: 20 + 6 + 45 + 0 + 0 = 71\n\n  Since the value (71) is greater than my outside offer (64), this offer should not be rejected lightly.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer**: Suppose I want to keep as close to the amount I\u2019ve already given in Round 1.\n  - If I retain more favorable items for myself, for instance: [3, 2, 0, 6, 6]\n  - My value would be:\n    - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n    - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n    - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n    - 6 units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n    - 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n    - Total value: 30 + 12 + 0 + 48 + 48 = 138\n\n  Based on this counter-offer, the total value (138) is significantly higher than both my outside offer and the current offer from Player 2.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the above calculations, I have a counteroffer that provides a much higher value (138) than my outside offer (64) and the current offer\u2019s value (71). Thus, proposing such a counteroffer is aligned with my best interest.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 5, 2, 0]}\n```\n\nThis offer might encourage Player 2 to reevaluate and come closer to achieving a mutually beneficial deal or prepare the basis for a potential further negotiation in round 3.",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 9 x 3 + 10 x 2\n    which is 47 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 48. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 9, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 9 x 9 + 7 x 1\n    which is 88 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 89. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 4, 6, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 4, 6, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 7, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 1 + 10 x 7 + 2 x 3 + 10 x 2 + 10 x 1\n    which is 113 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 114. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 5, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I need to analyze the current state of the negotiation:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - My outside offer value: 114\n   - Item values to me: \n     - Item 1: 7\n     - Item 2: 10\n     - Item 3: 2\n     - Item 4: 10\n     - Item 5: 10\n   - Total pool of items: [2, 9, 5, 2, 1]\n   - Current offer on the table: [1, 3, 0, 1, 1], meaning I would receive [1, 6, 5, 1, 0].\n   - Current value of the offer to me:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 7\n     - 6 units of item 2 = 60\n     - 5 units of item 3 = 10\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 10\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n     - Total value without discount = 87\n   - Due to the negotiations being in round 2, the value is multiplied by the discount factor (0.9^1) = 0.9: \n     - 87 * 0.9 = 78.3\n\n2) **Assessment of the Current Offer:**\n   - My total value if I accept the current offer is 78.3, significantly less than my outside offer of 114.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me a payoff of 78.3, which is less than what I would get from walking away (114); hence, I should not accept.\n   - Walking away guarantees me 114.\n   - I need to craft a counteroffer that gives me value higher than my outside offer while still being reasonable for Player 2 to consider.\n\nLet's explore a counteroffer. If I keep [1, 9, 1, 2, 0] (offering [1, 0, 4, 0, 1] to Player 2), my value will be:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 7\n   - 9 units of item 2 = 90\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 2\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 20\n   - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n   - Total value without discount = 119\n   - With discount in round 2 = 119 * 0.9 = 107.1\n\nEven after crafting this counteroffer, the value 107.1 is still less than my outside offer.\n\nAnother possibility: if I keep [2, 4, 1, 2, 1] and offer [0, 5, 4, 0, 0] to Player 2, my value is:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 14\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 40\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 2\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 20\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 10\n   - Total value without discount = 86\n   - With discount in round 2 = 86 * 0.9 = 77.4\n\nGiven that previous attempts have not surpassed my outside offer, it becomes unsuitable to put forward a counteroffer that may be worse than yielding to the fallback. Therefore, it's more beneficial to accept the outside offer.\n\nUltimately:\n\nMy best and risk-averse action, given this situation, is to **WALK** away, securing my fallback position and safeguarding my interests against unfavorable outcomes.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 2. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 93 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 4 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 5 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 2. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 6, 3, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 5 + 8 x 6 + 1 x 3 + 10 x 5 + 3 x 1\n    which is 144 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 145. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 3 x 1 + 4 x 0 + 6 x 4 + 6 x 1\n    which is 33 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 34. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, this might be too aggressive for an initial offer. To create room for negotiation while ensuring my value doesn't drop below 120, I'll propose slightly reducing the items I keep while ensuring my total value is just above 120.\n\n- **Potential Offer**:\n  Keeping [7, 4, 0, 5, 5] and offering [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]:\n  - Value = 6\\*7 + 1\\*4 + 5\\*0 + 3\\*5 + 9\\*5\n  - = 42 + 4 + 0 + 15 + 45 = 106\n\nThe above calculation leaves me with a total value of 106, which is less than 120. Adjusting this further:\n\n- **Revised Offer**:\n  Keeping [8, 0, 2, 5, 0] and offering [0, 4, 0, 0, 5]:\n  - Value = 6\\*8 + 1\\*0 + 5\\*2 + 3\\*5 + 9\\*0\n  - = 48 + 0 + 10 + 15 + 0 = 73\n\nEven with several iterations, it is difficult to find a suitable offer to maximize my value beyond my outside offer. So, I will maintain all items and offer resources with the least impact.\n\n- **Final Offer**:\n  Keeping: [8, 4, 0, 0, 0] and offering: [0, 0, 2, 5, 5]\n  - Value = 6\\*8 + 1\\*4 + 5\\*0 + 3\\*0 + 9\\*0\n  - = 48 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 52\n\nAs seen, there is currently no immediately better outcome than my outside offer, but generating unappealing starts the negotiation process for opportunities in future rounds.\n\n### 3) Decision\nSince I need to propose an offer but can comfortably walk in future rounds if needed, I propose starting with a potentially flexible offer for discovery and negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 23. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 23. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 105 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 10 x 1 + 6 x 2\n    which is 22 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 23. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 68. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 126 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 7 x 3 + 10 x 0 + 8 x 2 + 10 x 3\n    which is 67 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 68. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 40. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 40. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 102 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 10 x 2 + 3 x 3 + 9 x 0 + 2 x 5\n    which is 39 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 40. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 94. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 72 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 4, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 4 + 5 x 5 + 4 x 4 + 3 x 0 + 4 x 5\n    which is 93 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 94. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 3, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I will go through the analysis step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 58.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 5\n     - Item 2: 2\n     - Item 3: 6\n     - Item 4: 3\n     - Item 5: 4\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 3 of Item 1\n     - 6 of Item 2\n     - 2 of Item 3\n     - 5 of Item 4\n     - 3 of Item 5\n   - The discount factor is 0.9, which means the value of offers decreases with each round. Thus, offers in earlier rounds are more valuable.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to evaluate.\n   - For a potential counteroffer, I must propose a division where the items I keep have a total value greater than my outside offer of 58.\n\n   I will calculate the values of a few possible offers to ensure I propose a counteroffer appropriately:\n   - I decide to keep [3, 4, 1, 3, 1] units for myself.\n     - 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n     - 4 units of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n     - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - 3 units of Item 4: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n     - Total value = 42\n   - This only sums up to 42, which is less than my outside offer, so it's not acceptable.\n\n   I will modify my counteroffer to keep more valuable items:\n   - Let's consider keeping [3, 2, 2, 4, 2] units for myself.\n     - 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n     - 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n     - 2 units of Item 3: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n     - 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n     - 2 units of Item 5: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - Total value = 51\n   - This is still less than 58, so I need to adjust further.\n\n   I will try keeping [3, 2, 1, 5, 2] for myself:\n     - 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n     - 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n     - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - 5 units of Item 4: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n     - 2 units of Item 5: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - Total value = 48\n   - Still less than my outside offer.\n\n   I will propose keeping [3, 3, 2, 4, 3] for myself:\n     - 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n     - 3 units of Item 2: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n     - 2 units of Item 3: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n     - 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n     - 3 units of Item 5: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n     - Total value = 57\n   - Still less than my outside value.\n\nGiven the calculations, I need to optimize the division, keeping the most valuable combination while giving some away. Another attempt:\n\n- Trying [2, 3, 1, 5, 1] for myself results in:\n  - 2 units of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n  - 3 units of Item 2: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n  - 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n  - 5 units of Item 4: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n  - 1 units of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n  - Total value = 41, again insufficient.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   \nBased on continual attempt to maximize my own value preference without reaching my outside value, I determined I must accept the outside offer or make a significant value shift in items, thus rejected an asymmetrical value increment as I wasn't reaching my target yet.\n\nGiven no exact counteroffer positioned yet reaching my outside offer guarantees, I would keep simplifying the negotiation to avoid these counteroffer complexities at marginal less-than-outside results. I aim to maximize any negotiated settlement aligned definitively above 58 as unavoidable resultant thus far in clarity attempts.\n\nI hereby choose. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",

Propose an offer that ensures my value exceeds 62.\n\nExample proposed division for myself: Keep more of the higher-value-to-me items:\n- Keep 4 of item 1: \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\)\n- Keep 4 of item 2: \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)\n- Keep 3 of item 3: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n- Keep 2 of item 4: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n- Keep 3 of item 5: \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\)\n\nTotal value to me: \\(36 + 16 + 18 + 4 + 6 = 80\\)\n\nOffer the remaining:\n- Item 1: \\(5-4 = 1\\) (offering 1)\n- Item 2: \\(6-4 = 2\\) (offering 2)\n- Item 3: \\(4-3 = 1\\) (offering 1)\n- Item 4: \\(3-2 = 1\\) (offering 1)\n- Item 5: \\(4-3 = 1\\) (offering 1)\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\nSince my calculated value if I accept the proposed division (80) is greater than my outside offer (62), I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Accepting a beneficial offer earlier maximizes its value since subsequent rounds decrease the value.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table. Hence, there is no calculation regarding an existing offer.\n   - **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n     - Let's find a division that maximizes my total value above my outside offer of 125.\n     - Suppose I keep 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5, and offer the rest to Player 2:\n\n       \\[\n       \\begin{align*}\n       \\text{Value for Item 1} &: 4 \\times 9 = 36 \\\\\n       \\text{Value for Item 2} &: 1 \\times 3 = 3 \\\\\n       \\text{Value for Item 3} &: 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\\\\n       \\text{Value for Item 4} &: 0 \\times 8 = 0 \\\\\n       \\text{Value for Item 5} &: 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\\\\n       \\end{align*}\n       \\]\n\n       **Total Value = \\( 36 + 3 + 28 + 0 + 36 = 103 \\)**\n\n     - Clearly, this is not higher than my outside offer value of 125.

I must avoid mistakes by making sure I don't counteroffer below my outside offer.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer to ensure my total value remains above my outside offer value after considering the discount factor. A reasonable division might be:\n\n   - Offer Player 2 [0, 1, 3, 0, 1] so I retain maximum value without exceeding my outside offer after adjustment.\n\n   Offer breakdown:\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Keep Item 1} &: 5 \\\\\n   \\text{Keep Item 2} &: 2 \\\\\n   \\text{Keep Item 3} &: 4 \\\\\n   \\text{Keep Item 4} &: 1 \\\\\n   \\text{Keep Item 5} &: 6 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\nThe calculation would be:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Value for Item 1} &: 5 \\times 9 = 45 \\\\\n   \\text{Value for Item 2} &: 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\\\\n   \\text{Value for Item 3} &: 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\\\\n   \\text{Value for Item 4} &: 1 \\times 8 = 8 \\\\\n   \\text{Value for Item 5} &: 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n   Total Value = \\( 45 + 6 + 28 + 8 + 36 = 123 \\)\n\n   While this is still lower, the previous adjustments were the closest and I can iterate further next if needed.\n   \nOffer:\n   ```json\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]}\n   ```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 125. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

However, since we're already in the second round, the discount factor will apply to the agreed value only if we do not reach an agreement until the last round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 7, 1, 7]. If I accept, I get no items:\n     - Value = 0 \u00d7 9 + 0 \u00d7 3 + 0 \u00d7 7 + 0 \u00d7 8 + 0 \u00d7 6 = 0.\n     - This is far less than my outside offer of 125. Accepting it would be a Mistake 4.\n   - For a potential counteroffer, I need an allocation that gives me a value greater than 125. \n    \n   Let's propose a potential counteroffer. For a viable offer, let's see if keeping the entire allocation of item 3 and no allocation of other items can work. Therefore, potential values for each item division:\n   - Items kept by me: [5, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n     - Value = 5 \u00d7 9 + 3 \u00d7 3 + 0 \u00d7 7 + 1 \u00d7 8 + 0 \u00d7 6 = 45 + 9 + 0 + 8 + 0 = 62. \n\n   This is less than my outside offer.

Another plan:\n   - Offer [0, 3, 5, 0, 7] (I keep items [5, 0, 2, 1, 0]):\n     - Value = 5 \u00d7 9 + 0 \u00d7 3 + 2 \u00d7 7 + 1 \u00d7 8 + 0 \u00d7 6 = 45 + 0 + 14 + 8 + 0 = 67.\n\n   - Offer [0, 1, 6, 0, 7] (I keep items [5, 2, 1, 1, 0]):\n     - Value = 5 \u00d7 9 + 2 \u00d7 3 + 1 \u00d7 7 + 1 \u00d7 8 + 0 \u00d7 6 = 45 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 0 = 66.\n\n   After evaluating, consider:\n   - Structuring an offer where I secure maximum value akin to the separation from previous turns:\n   - Offer [0, 1, 4, 0, 7] (I keep items [5, 2, 3, 1, 0]):\n     - Value = 5 \u00d7 9 + 2 \u00d7 3 + 3 \u00d7 7 + 1 \u00d7 8 + 0 \u00d7 6 = 45 + 6 + 21 + 8 + 0 = 80.\n\n   Keeping this past calculated option is beneficial, which could be pivotal:\n   - This offer surpasses all previously calculated counteroffers.\n   - Ensure priorities maintain maximization.\n   \n3) Make a decision based on the above analyses:\n   - Definitely reject the current offer and provide a counteroffer that provides more than 125 value, as otherwise results lead to worse conditions.\n\nTherefore, given potential adjustments and the need to exceed the outside offer value:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 4, 0, 7]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 125. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 7, 0, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 3 + 3 x 2 + 7 x 7 + 8 x 0 + 6 x 7\n    which is 124 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 125. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 7, 1, 7]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 0, 7]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 102. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 129 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 8 x 4 + 9 x 3 + 8 x 4 + 10 x 1\n    which is 101 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 102. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 64. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 64. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 51 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 2 x 2 + 3 x 4 + 4 x 3 + 7 x 5\n    which is 63 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 64. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Adjustments like [0, 0, 2, 3, 5] result in:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 2 = 12\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n     - Total value = 2 + 12 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 23\n\n   - Still adjusting more balance provides [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n     - I keep: \n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n       - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 2 = 12\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n     - Total value = 1 + 12 + 9 + 8 + 21 = 51\n\n   - Eventually, adjusting the offer pattern as providing [0, 0, 4, 1, 3]:\n     - I keep: \n       - 2 unit of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 2 = 12\n       - 5 units of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 21\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 16\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 14\n\n     - Total value = 2 + 12 + 15 + 15 = 56\n\nThis approach, producing [0, 0, 4, 1, 3] as a COUNTEROFFER ensures I can avoid walking niche lower than my outside offer value and request to Player 2 a higher offer beyond current. Hence thus;\n\n   Therefore, my chosen action is:\n   ```json\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 1, 3]}\n   ```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 103. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 102 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 4, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 7 x 4 + 9 x 4 + 3 x 1 + 7 x 5\n    which is 102 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 103. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 7 x 3\n    which is 23 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 24. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 70. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 81 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 1, 9] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 1 + 4 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 10 x 1 + 6 x 9\n    which is 69 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 70. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

But if the negotiation proceeds to later rounds, the value will be multiplied by the discount factor (gamma = 0.9).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nThere is no current offer on the table, so I need to create a counteroffer.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers\nTo have a high chance of acceptance, I should propose an offer that keeps enough value to exceed my outside offer of 70. I will calculate my value for different divisions and choose one that maximizes my remaining value.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer: Offer [1, 1, 0, 2, 4] to Player 2**\n- **Value Calculation for Me:**\n  - I keep: \n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 x 5 = 5\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 x 4 = 4\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0 x 2 = 0\n    - 4 units of item 4 = 4 x 10 = 40\n    - 5 units of item 5 = 5 x 6 = 30\n  - My Total Value = 5 + 4 + 0 + 40 + 30 = 79\n\nMy total value of 79 is higher than my outside offer of 70, which makes this a worthwhile offer to keep me above my fallback position.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nTo avoid any mistakes:\n- Mistake 2: The offer should be better than my outside offer (it is: 79 > 70).\n- Mistake 5: Walking away without testing this counteroffer is not optimal since it can potentially yield more than my outside offer.\n\nIn conclusion, the ideal action is to make the discussed counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 2, 4]}\n```",

Let's calculate a possible beneficial division.\n   \n3) Develop a counteroffer:\n   - Let's try an initial division where I consider keeping more valuable items to me.\n   - If I offer: [2, 2, 0, 1, 1] to Player 2, I keep [2, 3, 0, 1, 2] for myself.\n   - My values from these would be:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n     - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n   - Total value = 8 + 15 + 0 + 8 + 14 = 45\n\nSince 45 is greater than my outside offer of 28, this is a viable counteroffer.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 19. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 19. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 78 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 9 x 2 + 1 x 0\n    which is 18 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 19. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. My outside offer guarantees me a value of 19.\n2. My private values are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 1 per unit,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 6 per unit,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 9 per unit,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 9 per unit,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 1 per unit.\n3. The total items available are: [4, 5, 0, 2, 3].\n4. The current offer on the table by Player 1 is [2, 2, 0, 1, 1] being offered to me. Calculating the value:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n\u2003\u2003Total = 2 + 12 + 0 + 9 + 1 = 24\n5. Since we are still in round 1, the discount factor is \u03b3^(r-1) = 0.9^(0) = 1. That means accepting now gives a full value of 24.\n6. Comparing 24 (the value of the accepted offer) to my outside offer of 19, the current offer is clearly better.\n7. There\u2019s no need to risk counteroffering because not only is the current offer already yielding a payoff better than my outside offer, but a counteroffer could potentially reduce the final discounted value if it gets accepted in later rounds.\n8. Thus, the best action for me in this round is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\nFinal decision:\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 7 x 4 + 6 x 3\n    which is 46 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 47. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make the decision, let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis**:\n   - My outside offer value is 64.\n   - My values per item: Item 1 = 4, Item 2 = 1, Item 3 = 5, Item 4 = 2, Item 5 = 8.\n   - Total pool of items: 8 of Item 1, 4 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 7 of Item 4, 3 of Item 5.\n   - Discount factor (gamma) of 0.9 affects the present value if negotiations progress further into round 3, which isn't ideal as we are already in round 2.\n\n2) **Offer Value Assessments**:\n\n   **Current Offer [4, 0, 0, 1, 0]**:\n   - Value to me: \n     - 4 units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n     - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - 0 units of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n     - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n     - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n   - Total value = 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 18\n\n   Comparing this to my outside offer of 64, this offer of 18 is much lower. This would be Mistake 4 to accept this offer, as it's worse than my outside offer.\n\n   **Potential Counteroffer**:\n   - I need to generate a proposal where my hold items value exceeds 64. Let's calculate for example a counteroffer where I keep most of the high-value items:\n\n   Let's try keeping:\n   - 6 of Item 1, 0 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 4 of Item 4, 0 of Item 5. This leaves Player 2 with a counteroffer of [2, 4, 0, 3, 3].\n\n   My retained (proposed) configuration value:\n   - 6 units of Item 1 = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24\n   - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n   - 4 units of Item 4 = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n   - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n   - Total value = 24 + 0 + 10 + 8 + 0 = 42\n\n   This value of 42 is still below my outside offer of 64. I need to keep more valuable items or reconsider distribution to achieve a better value.\n\n   Let's adjust for higher value:\n   - Keeping: [6, 0, 2, 7, 0] (same as previous but keeping all item 4)\n   - Giving Player 2: [2, 4, 0, 0, 3]\n\n   My value for keeping proposed:\n   - 6 units of Item 1 = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24\n   - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n   - 7 units of Item 4 = 7 \u00d7 2 = 14\n   - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n   - Total value = 24 + 0 + 10 + 14 + 0 = 48\n   \n   Still, my total value is less than 64. I will need to adjust retaining even more or from other items particularly item 5.\n\n3) **Decision**:\n   Given the inability to find a satisfying counteroffer proposed values exceeding my outside offer, accepting the current offer is suboptimal (Mistake 4) and the best course of action is either to counter with a higher value outcome for myself or walk away if no feasible counter can be sourced.\n\nNow trying to adjust once more:\n   - Keeping:  [5, 0, 2, 6, 2]\n   - Giving: [3, 4, 0, 1, 1]\n\n   Value:\n   - 5 units of Item 1 = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n   - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0 \n   - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n   - 6 units of Item 4 = 6 \u00d7 2 = 12\n   - 2 unit of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n   - Total = 20 + 0 + 10 + 12 + 16 = 58\n\nThis value still shy from my outside offer indicating possible configurations of items not yielding better own offer. However, current less optimal results indicates a WALK.\n\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 2. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 78 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 3 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 2 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 2. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 6 x 2 + 10 x 3 + 8 x 2 + 10 x 2\n    which is 78 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 79. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 3, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

For now, my outside offer acts as a baseline comparison.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer**: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n     - My value if accepted:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 x 1 = 1\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 x 6 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 x 10 = 10\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 x 8 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 x 10 = 10\n       - Total = 1 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 10 = 21\n\n   - This is far below my outside offer value of 79.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - **Accepting the current offer** would give me a value of 21, which is much worse than my outside offer. (Mistake 4: Avoid accepting an offer worse than my outside offer.)\n   - **Walking away** would guarantee me my outside offer value of 79.\n   - **Counteroffer**: \n     - I need to propose an offer that gives me at least 79 in value (avoiding Mistake 2).\n     - Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 2 [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]:\n       - I keep: [3, 2, 3, 2, 2]\n       - My total value would be:\n         - 3 units of item 1 = 3 x 1 = 3\n         - 2 units of item 2 = 2 x 6 = 12\n         - 3 units of item 3 = 3 x 10 = 30\n         - 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 8 = 16\n         - 2 units of item 5 = 2 x 10 = 20\n         - Total = 3 + 12 + 30 + 16 + 20 = 81\n\nSince the value of 81 is greater than my outside offer of 79, and considering the discount for future rounds, it is beneficial to make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 5, 1, 9] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 2 + 1 x 0 + 6 x 5 + 7 x 1 + 7 x 9\n    which is 112 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 113. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To systematically determine the best action, let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 113.\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 6 per unit\n  - Item 2: 1 per unit\n  - Item 3: 6 per unit\n  - Item 4: 7 per unit\n  - Item 5: 7 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 9 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is 0.9. This means that if no deal is reached until later rounds, the effective value of any agreement will be reduced by this factor. Immediate agreement has a better present value.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer Value if Accepted**: There is no offer on the table currently.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to formulate a counteroffer that will provide me a total value greater than or equal to my outside offer value of 113.\n\nLet's evaluate a potential counteroffer where I propose offering Player 2 items and maximize my return:\n\n#### Example Counteroffer:\nI offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]:\n- For me, that means I keep [2, 2, 5, 1, 7].\n\nCalculating my values for keeping these quantities:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 7 = 49\n\nTotal value for me: 12 + 2 + 30 + 7 + 49 = 100\n\nThis proposal is below my outside offer of 113. I'll adjust the offer to improve my value:\n\n#### Better Counteroffer:\nLet's offer Player 2 [0, 0, 2, 0, 8]:\n- For me, that means I keep [2, 2, 3, 1, 1].\n\nRecalculate my values:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n\nTotal value for me: 12 + 2 + 18 + 7 + 7 = 46\n\nBoth offers fell short. Let's attempt a different combination:\n\n#### Alternative Counteroffer:\nLet's propose [0, 0, 4, 0, 8]:\n- For me, I keep [2, 2, 1, 1, 1].\n\nRecompute my values:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n\nTotal value for me: 12 + 2 + 6 + 7 + 7 = 34\n\nThis approach hasn't reached the necessary value either. \n\nRefined Proposal:\nLet's propose [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n- For me, I keep [2, 2, 5, 1, 9].\nCalculating my value:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 6 =\n\n30\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- 9 units of item 5: 9 \u00d7 7 = 63\n\nTotal value: 12 + 2 + 30 + 7 + 63 = 114\n\nThis offer gives me a higher value than my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Decision:\nBased on this analysis and calculations, I will propose the counteroffer that retains most of the value while meeting my outside offer value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Let's evaluate various scenarios:\n\nLet's consider keeping as many valuable items as possible:\n\n##### Hypothetical counteroffer: [0, 2, 0, 0, 6]\n- I will keep:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n- Total value = 12 + 0 + 30 + 7 + 21 = 70\n\nThis value, 70, is less than my outside offer, so I must adjust to increase my retained value.\n\n##### Adjusted counteroffer: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n- I will keep:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - 9 units of item 5 = 9 \u00d7 7 = 63\n- Total value = 12 + 0 + 30 + 7 + 63 = 112\n\nStill less than 113, I need to find an even more favorable division that surpasses 113.\n\n##### Optimal try: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n- I will keep all items (considering my unsuccessful realignment)\n  - Total value = 2 \u00d7 6 + 2 \u00d7 1 + 5 \u00d7 6 + 1 \u00d7 7 + 9 \u00d7 7 = 114 \n\nThis is not feasible for a counteroffer because it gives nothing to Player 2 and was already rejected.\n\n#### Conclusion: Proposed Counteroffer\n\nConsidering various options explored, items mostly retained to approach a better offer include minimal-sharing strategies or near-total retention. Further, my earlier [0, 0, 0, 0, 20] failed, so [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] gives neither adequate nor permissible balance owing to Player 2 rejection history.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 88. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 88. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 78 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 9 x 4 + 10 x 3 + 4 x 5 + 1 x 1\n    which is 87 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 88. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Since there is no previous offer, I must exceed my outside offer value.\n\nI will calculate a potential counteroffer:\n\n- Let's consider keeping [1, 5, 2, 5, 1] items (offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] to Player 2):\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n  - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n  - Total value = 2 + 45 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 88\n\nSince this exactly matches my outside offer, I need to slightly adjust to achieve more than 88:\n\n- Trying a different division: [0, 4, 2, 5, 1] (offering [2, 1, 1, 0, 1] to Player 2):\n  - 0 unit of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n  - Total value = 0 + 36 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 77\n\nThis value is less than my outside offer. Let's try:\n\n- Adjusting again: [1, 4, 2, 5, 1] (offering [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] to Player 2):\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n  - Total value = 2 + 36 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 79\n\nStill less than my outside offer. I seem to be at a balance point.\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose the counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] (offering 1 of item 1, the remaining unit of item 3, and 1 of item 5 to Player 2), achieving 88.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]}",

This self-test yields a value of 2x2 + 1x9 + 0x10 + 3x4 + 0x1 = 27, which does not exceed my outside offer value.\n  Attempt another configuration:\n  - If I keep [2, 4, 2, 4, 0], I offer [0, 1, 1, 1, 2] to Player 2.\n  - My value = 2\u00d72 + 4\u00d79 + 2\u00d710 + 4\u00d74 + 0\u00d71 = 8 + 36 + 20 + 16 + 0 = 80\n  - 80 is still less than 88. Continue optimization where units are adjusted to result in a better outcome.\n  - If I reserve opportunity to make only necessary modifications up to walking to final draft:\n  - Keep relatively few and valuable unit rearrangements:\n    - Keeping [1, 5, 3, 4, 0] will propose a counteroffer allowing Player 2 [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]:\n\n  Final Counteroffer assessment:\n  - My value on keeping [1, 5, 3, 4, 0] = 1\u00d72 + 5\u00d79 + 3\u00d710 + 4\u00d74 + 0\u00d71 = 2 + 45 + 30 + 16 + 0 = 93\n  - 93 exceeds 88, my outside offer. With discounting factored in, this correction remains proper enough from current round. Aim is utmost optimization without straining against competition iterancy in offers.\n\nGiven these calculations, I will propose a counteroffer designed to maximize my value while being better than my outside offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 40. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 48 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 4 x 3 + 4 x 5 + 1 x 1\n    which is 39 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 40. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "My analysis is as follows:\n\n1. My outside offer guarantees a value of 40. In any deal I conclude now, the outcome is discounted by \u03b3^(r\u20131). In round 2 the discount factor is 0.9 so any deal I accept now will be worth 0.9\u00d7(raw value of my share). To beat my outside offer, the raw value of my kept items should be at least 40/0.9 \u2248 44.44.\n\n2. With the total pool of items given by:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 units \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 5 units \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 units \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 5 units \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 units\nand my private values per unit as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1 = 1, Item 2 = 6, Item 3 = 4, Item 4 = 4, Item 5 = 1,\nthe total pool value for me is 66 if I got every unit.\n\n3. In the current offer [1, 0, 0, 1, 2] (meaning I would receive 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5), my total raw value would be:\n\u2003\u20031\u00d71 + 0\u00d76 + 0\u00d74 + 1\u00d74 + 2\u00d71 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 2 = 7,\nwhich when discounted (0.9\u00d77 = 6.3) is far below my fallback of 40. So accepting would be a mistake.\n\n4. I now propose a counteroffer. In our negotiation protocol a counteroffer specifies the items I give to Player 1 so that I keep the remaining items. If I let X = [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5] be the offered amounts to Player 1, then I keep K = [2\u2013x1, 5\u2013x2, 3\u2013x3, 5\u2013x4, 2\u2013x5]. My raw value is:\n\u2003\u2003Value = 1\u00d7(2\u2013x1) + 6\u00d7(5\u2013x2) + 4\u00d7(3\u2013x3) + 4\u00d7(5\u2013x4) + 1\u00d7(2\u2013x5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 66 \u2013 (x1 + 6x2 + 4x3 + 4x4 + x5).\n\nTo get at least a raw value of about 45 (more conservatively ensuring it beats the fallback after discounting), I need to keep at least 45 value for myself. This requires:\n\u2003\u2003x1 + 6x2 + 4x3 + 4x4 + x5 \u2264 66 \u2013 45 = 21.\n\n5. I want a counteroffer that gives me as many high-valued items (especially item 2 with value 6) and minimizes giving away value. A plausible division is to keep most of item 2 and only offer some of the lower valued items. For example, if I propose keeping:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: keep 1 unit (thus offer 1)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: keep all 5 units (offer 0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: keep 2 of 3 units (offer 1)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: keep 3 of 5 units (offer 2)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: keep 1 of 2 units (offer 1)\nThen my kept bundle K = [1, 5, 2, 3, 1], whose raw value is:\n\u2003\u20031\u00d71 + 5\u00d76 + 2\u00d74 + 3\u00d74 + 1\u00d71 = 1 + 30 + 8 + 12 + 1 = 52.\nDiscounting this deal in round 2 gives 0.9\u00d752 = 46.8, which beats my outside offer of 40.\n\n6. This counteroffer (offering [1, 0, 1, 2, 1] to Player 1) avoids the mistakes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I am not offering less value for myself than my fallback.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I am preserving the most valuable items for me.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I am offering a nonzero offer to Player 1.\nThus, with all considerations in mind, my best move is to propose the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]}",

Hence, the value of this round's negotiation isn't adjusted by gamma.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - Current offer [1, 0, 1, 2, 1] means I get: \n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 x 2 = 2\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 x 9 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 x 10 = 10\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 x 4 = 8\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 1 = 1\n     - Total value = 2 + 0 + 10 + 8 + 1 = 21\n   \n   - Comparing 21 with my outside offer value of 88, the current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n\n3) Decision Making:\n   - Accepting the current offer would be a mistake because my value from it is far below my outside offer (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away would yield my outside offer value of 88, which is better than accepting the current offer.\n   - As this is the final round, Player 2 cannot counteroffer my counteroffer (it would be treated as a walk), so proposing an offer that improves my outcome compared to the current offer is key. Let's consider a counteroffer.\n   - One potential counteroffer could be offering the opponent the items with lower values to me and keeping more valuable items:\n     - For example, offer [2, 2, 0, 2, 1] which would leave me:\n       - 0 units of item 1: 0 x 2 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 2: 3 x 9 = 27\n       - 3 units of item 3: 3 x 10 = 30\n       - 3 units of item 4: 3 x 4 = 12\n       - 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 1 = 1\n       - Total value = 0 + 27 + 30 + 12 + 1 = 70\n   \n   - The value of this counteroffer, 70, is still lower than my outside offer value. Thus, any attempt to counteroffer seems futile to improve over my outside offer.\n   \nIn conclusion, none of the potential counteroffer values exceed or match the value of my outside offer, and the current offer is worse than my outside offer. Therefore, the best decision is to take my outside offer. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 64. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 6, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 2 + 10 x 4 + 1 x 6 + 2 x 3 + 9 x 1\n    which is 63 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 64. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, let's step through the analysis based on the instructions provided:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 64.\n   - My value per unit for each item is:\n     - Item 1: 1\n     - Item 2: 10\n     - Item 3: 1\n     - Item 4: 2\n     - Item 5: 9\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the value by decreasing the effective value of the deal if it is pushed into later rounds (e.g., in round 2 the value is multiplied by \\(0.9^{1}\\) and round 3 by \\(0.9^{2}\\)).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - There is currently no offer on the table for me to accept.\n   - I need to make an initial counteroffer that gives me a value at least as much as my outside offer (64). \n  \n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   To prevent Mistake 2 (making an offer worse for you than your outside offer), my counteroffer needs to yield a value of at least 64 for me. Let's consider keeping all items myself and see if I get a better value, or find a better division:\n\n   - Keeping all items [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] would yield:\n     - 4 x 1 + 4 x 10 + 6 x 1 + 3 x 2 + 1 x 9 = 65\n     - This initial check establishes the maximum I could gain which is slightly more than my outside offer.\n\n   A balanced offer could be strategic to engage the other player. For an initial high offer proposal, I'll try to keep a division close to yielding 64:\n\n   - Let's propose giving Player 2 two units of item 1, one unit of item 2, three units of item 3, one unit of item 4, and zero units of item 5, keeping [2, 3, 3, 2, 1] for myself:\n\n     - This gives:\n       - 2 x 1 + 3 x 10 + 3 x 1 + 2 x 2 + 1 x 9 \n       - = 2 + 30 + 3 + 4 + 9 \n       - = 48\n\n   This proposal doesn't yield a value of 64, so it would not be satisfactory. \n\n   Let's refine the offer so that it reaches a higher value close to 64:\n\n   - Propose giving Player 2 three units of item 1, zero units of item 2, four units of item 3, zero unit of item 4, and zero units of item 5, keeping [1, 4, 2, 3, 1]:\n\n     - Calculation:\n       - 1 x 1 + 4 x 10 + 2 x 1 + 3 x 2 + 1 x 9 \n       - = 1 + 40 + 2 + 6 + 9 \n       - = 58\n\n   This value is also still less than 64. So we iterate again.\n\n   Trying again:\n\n   - Propose giving Player 2 two units each of items 1 and 3, and one unit of item 2 and 4, keeping [2, 3, 4, 2, 1] for myself:\n\n     - Calculation:\n       - 2 x 1 + 3 x 10 + 4 x 1 + 2 x 2 + 1 x 9 \n       - = 2 + 30 + 4 + 4 + 9 \n       - = 49\n\n   This offer continues to be unacceptable since it\u2019s below 64. \n\n   Finally: \n\n   - I make a more minimal concession with [2, 3, 5, 3, 1]:\n\n     - Calculation:\n       - 2 x 1 + 3 x 10 + 5 x 1 + 3 x 2 + 1 x 9 \n       - = 2 + 30 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 52\n\n   To not waste any valuable opportunity and rounded steps for simplicity, let's move on to another plausible configuration:\n\n   Let's propose:\n\nLet's propose giving:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nCalculates my value:\n- 1 x 1 + 3 x 10 + 4 x 1 + 3 x 2 + 1 x 9\n- 1 x 1 + 3 x 10 + 4 x 1 + 3 x 2 + 1 x 9 = 1 + 30 + 4 + 6 + 9 = 50\n\n This is still unfortunately not as good as needed\n \n: Should I continue to make an offer considering I incremented yet around earlier disclosure coordinates?\n\n   I propose giving:\n  \n   - 0 unit of item 1\n   - 2 units of item 2\n   - 2 units of item 3\n   - 1 units of item 4\n   - 0 units of item 5\n   \n   Meaning I keep [4, 2, 4, 2, 1] for myself.\n\n   Which calculates my value:\n   \n   - 4 x 1 + 2 x 10 + 4 x 1 + 2 x 2 + 1 x 9 \n   - = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 9 \n   - = 41\n\nThis untouched vein that newly counterproposed offer, eligible, would extensively present a fair counteroffer might yield less inconsistency.\n\nThus:\n\nTherefore, given that obtaining all items yields a marginal gain, minimally accepting the external offer appears more optimal with the influences prompting. Accordingly, my action involves taking the legally direct approach:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 84. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 117 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 8 x 1 + 9 x 2 + 9 x 4 + 7 x 3\n    which is 83 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 84.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 4. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 72 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 3 x 1 + 5 x 0 + 6 x 0\n    which is 3 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 4. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 40. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 66 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 7 x 2 + 2 x 5 + 3 x 5\n    which is 39 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 40. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 37. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 81 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 4 x 1 + 9 x 2 + 4 x 2\n    which is 36 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 37. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 4 x 2 + 3 x 4 + 2 x 1 + 9 x 2\n    which is 40 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 41. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 10 x 3 + 3 x 1 + 7 x 4\n    which is 61 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 62. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 4 x 0 + 3 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 2. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 58. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 84 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 9, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 4 x 0 + 4 x 9 + 9 x 2 + 1 x 3\n    which is 57 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 58. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 10 x 4 + 2 x 0 + 6 x 5\n    which is 70 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 71. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 4, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 5, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 112. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 123 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 7, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 1 + 2 x 1 + 10 x 1 + 10 x 7 + 10 x 2\n    which is 111 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 112. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 7, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 1 + 2 x 1 + 10 x 1 + 10 x 7 + 10 x 2\n    which is 111 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 112. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 3, 5, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 3, 5, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer:**\n  - Value = (1 * 8) + (1 * 8) + (1 * 8) + (1 * 9) + (1 * 2)\n  - Value = 8 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 2 = 35\n\n- **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9 for round 3 implies I get 0.9^2 = 0.81 of the value.\n  - Adjusted value if accepted: 35 * 0.81 = 28.35\n\n- **Compare to my outside offer:** 28.35 is substantially less than my outside offer of 100.\n\n### 3. Make a Decision\n- **Accept or Walk:** Accepting the current offer gives me much less value than my outside offer even after discount adjustments.\n- **Proposing a Counteroffer:** It\u2019s the final round, and attempting to propose another counteroffer when opponent will walk if rejected offers less value typically.\n\nGiven the above calculations, the current offer's value is too low compared to my guaranteed outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 4 x 2 + 3 x 0 + 10 x 2\n    which is 28 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 29. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 53. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 4, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 1 + 1 x 3 + 1 x 4 + 2 x 4 + 9 x 3\n    which is 52 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 53. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This is far lower than my outside option.\n   - Walking away guarantees me my outside offer value of 53.\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that ensures my kept items' value is greater than 53.\n\nA reasonable counteroffer can be where I keep most higher-value items:\n   - If I keep [3, 2, 4, 3, 2] and offer [2, 1, 0, 1, 1] to player 2, my value would be:\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 10 = 30\n     - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 1 = 4\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n     - Total value = 60\n   - 60 is greater than my outside offer of 53.\n\nBy proposing a counteroffer of [2, 1, 0, 1, 1], I maximize my gain from the negotiation.\n\nSo, I will make this counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

I need to adjust the allocation to meet or exceed 50.\n\n   Retrying with different allocation:\n   Keeping:\n   - Item 1: 3 units\n   - Item 2: 1 unit\n   - Item 3: 0 units\n   - Item 4: 2 units\n   - Item 5: 3 units\n\n   Offer to Player 2:\n   - Item 1: 0 units\n   - Item 2: 6 units\n   - Item 3: 4 units\n   - Item 4: 1 unit\n   - Item 5: 0 units\n\n   Value to me:\n   - Item 1: 3 x 3 = 9\n   - Item 2: 1 x 3 = 3\n   - Item 3: 0 x 1 = 0\n   - Item 4: 2 x 4 = 8\n   - Item 5: 3 x 8 = 24\n   - Total value = 44\n\n   This is still below the outside offer. I need to adjust once again.\n\n   Let's make a more conservative offer that maximizes high-value items:\n   Keeping:\n   - Item 1: 3 units\n   - Item 2: 0 units\n   - Item 3: 0 units\n   - Item 4: 3 units\n   - Item 5: 3 units\n\n   Offer to Player 2:\n   - Item 1: 0 units\n   - Item 2: 7 units\n   - Item 3: 4 units\n   - Item 4: 0 units\n   - Item 5: 0 units\n\n   Value to me:\n   - Item 1: 3 x 3 = 9\n   - Item 2: 0 x 3 = 0\n   - Item 3: 0 x 1 = 0\n   - Item 4: 3 x 4 = 12\n   - Item 5: 3 x 8 = 24\n   - Total value = 45\n\n   Overall, I need further adjustment to meet or exceed 50. Let's try incrementally:\n\n   Keeping more of item 4 and 5, which have higher value:\n   Keeping:\n   - Item 1: 3 units\n   - Item 2: 1 units\n   - Item 3: 0 units\n   - Item 4: 3 units\n   - Item 5: 2 units\n\n   Offer to Player 2:\n   - Item 1: 0 units\n   - Item 2: 6 units\n   - Item 3: 4 units\n   - Item 4: 0 units\n   - Item 5: 1 units\n\n   Value to me:\n   - Item 1: 3 x 3 = 9\n   - Item 2: 1 x 3 = 3\n   - Item 3: 0 x 1 = 0\n   - Item 4: 3 x 4 = 12\n   - Item 5: 2 x 8 = 16\n   - Total value = 40\n\n   Re-assessing for the best strategy:\n\n   To meet the 50, my adjustments:\n\n   Let's adjust again:\n   Keeping:\n   - Item 1: 2 units\n   - Item 2: 0 units\n   - Item 3: 0 units\n   - Item 4: 3 units\n   - Item 5: 3 units\n\n   Offer to Player 2:\n   - Item 1: 1 units\n   - Item 2: 7 units\n   - Item 3: 4 units\n   - Item 4: 0 units\n   - Item 5: 0 units\n\n   Value to me:\n   - Item 1: 2 x 3 = 6\n   - Item 2: 0 x 3 = 0\n   - Item 3: 0 x 1 = 0\n   - Item 4: 3 x 4 = 12\n   - Item 5: 3 x 8 = 24\n   - Total value = 42\n\n   I cannot improve to exceed 50 with current adjustments. My best strategy is walking away if no offer is constructed correctly.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\n   Since I have struggled to find an offer that guarantees my value exceeds 50, my optimal action in this scenario is to WALK, leveraging my outside offer.\n\n   Thus, my action is:\n   \n   {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 78. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 78. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 93 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 2 + 9 x 0 + 6 x 2 + 9 x 5 + 6 x 3\n    which is 77 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 78. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Step 1 \u2013 Analyze the situation:\n\u2022 My outside offer is 74 (guaranteed payoff if I walk away).\n\u2022 My private values for the 5 items are: [2, 8, 3, 7, 2] per unit.\n\u2022 The total pool of items is: [3, 4, 4, 6, 3].\n\u2022 With a discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9, any deal reached in round 2 is valued at 0.9 times its raw (undiscounted) value. Thus, if I get a deal with raw value V, its present value is 0.9 \u00d7 V. To beat my fallback of 74, I need a raw utility V such that 0.9 \u00d7 V \u2265 74, i.e. V \u2265 74/0.9 \u2248 82.22.\n\u2022 The current offer on the table from Player 1 is [2, 0, 0, 1, 0] (that is, they would give me 2 of item1, 0 of item2, 0 of item3, 1 of item4, and 0 of item5). My raw utility for that offer would be:\n\u2003item1: 2\u00d72 = 4; item2: 0\u00d78 = 0; item3: 0\u00d73 = 0; item4: 1\u00d77 = 7; item5: 0\u00d72 = 0; total = 11.\n\u2003Discounted value = 11\u00d70.9 = 9.9, which is dramatically less than my fallback of 74.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Assess potential counteroffers:\n\u2022 In a counteroffer, I propose an offer vector that specifies what I give to Player 1. My own bundle then becomes \u201ctotal pool minus the offered items.\u201d My raw utility for my bundle is calculated by summing (units kept \u00d7 my private value) over all items.\n\u2022 To ensure my deal is better than my outside offer, my raw utility must be at least \u224882.22.\n\u2022 The total raw value of the full pool is 98, so the total raw \u201ccost\u201d of what I give to Player 1 must be at most 98 \u2212 82.22 = 15.78.\n\u2022 In addition, I want to avoid the mistakes outlined:\n\u2003\u2013 Mistake 3 warns against offering no items to the opponent. While keeping everything (an offer of [0,0,0,0,0]) would maximize my utility, it is considered a suboptimal or \u201cflagrant\u201d move.\n\u2022 Therefore, I should offer a minimal concession.\n\u2022 Since items 2 and 4 are high in value to me (values 8 and 7) I want to keep them intact. The items I value the least are items 1, 3, and 5 (with values 2, 3, and 2 respectively). Of these, offering a single unit of an item that has a value of 2 is among the cheapest concessions I can make.\n\u2022 For example, if I offer Player 1 one unit of item 5, my counteroffer would be:\n\u2003Offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] \n\u2003Then my bundle becomes: [3, 4, 4, 6, 2] (since 3\u20130, 4\u20130, 4\u20130, 6\u20130, 3\u20131).\n\u2003My raw utility would then be:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3\u00d72 = 6\n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 4\u00d78 = 32\n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4\u00d73 = 12\n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 6\u00d77 = 42\n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2\u00d72 = 4\n\u2003\u2003Total = 6 + 32 + 12 + 42 + 4 = 96.\n\u2003Discounted value = 96\u00d70.9 = 86.4, which is comfortably above my outside offer of 74.\n\u2022 This counteroffer avoids giving away too much (it \u201ccosts\u201d me only 2 raw points) while ensuring I get a very high utility if Player 1 accepts.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Final decision:\n\u2022 The current offer is far worse than my fallback.\n\u2022 I must make a counteroffer that gives me a discounted utility well above 74.\n\u2022 The counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] meets that criterion, as explained without triggering any of the outlined mistakes.\n\nFinal action in valid JSON format:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

However, since we are in the last round, I must decide if I should walk away or accept, making gamma less relevant at this point.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n  - My total value if I accept this offer:\n    - 0 x 1 (Item 1) + 0 x 9 (Item 2) + 0 x 6 (Item 3) + 0 x 9 (Item 4) + 1 x 6 (Item 5) = 6\n  - The value of 6 is much less than my outside offer of 78.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers:** \n  - I need to calculate various potential counteroffers to ensure they provide higher value than my outside offer of 78. Offering Player 2 a minimal amount while maximizing my retained value is crucial for achieving this.\n\n### Step 3: Decision-making\n- Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer and leads to mistake 4.\n- Walking away with my outside offer value of 78 is a guaranteed fallback, preventing mistake 5.\n- Making a viable counteroffer involves retaining more valuable items for myself without dipping below a value of 78.\n\nGiven these points, to form a counteroffer with a higher retained value for myself, consider keeping the maximum value from the items:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n- Value computation if I keep: [2, 3, 4, 4, 3]\n  - 2 x 1 (Item 1) + 3 x 9 (Item 2) + 4 x 6 (Item 3) + 4 x 9 (Item 4) + 3 x 6 (Item 5) = 90\n\nSince this counteroffer (offering [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]) leads to a retention value of 90, which is higher than my outside offer value of 78, it provides more advantage.\n\nThus, my decision is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 74. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 74. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 66 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 8 x 2 + 3 x 3 + 7 x 6 + 2 x 3\n    which is 73 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 74. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I should aim to make a decision as early as possible to maximize value, but not at the cost of accepting a poor deal.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no offer from Player 2 yet, I'll consider potential counteroffers. I need to propose an offer that maximizes my value and is better than my outside offer.\n\nTo determine a suitable counteroffer, let's consider keeping the following items to maximize value:\n\n- **Keep for Myself**:\n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 1 unit\n  - Item 3: 2 units\n  - Item 4: 0 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n\n- **Offer to Player 2**:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit (4 - 3)\n  - Item 2: 0 units (1 - 1)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (4 - 2)\n  - Item 4: 3 units (3 - 0)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit (2 - 1)\n\n**Calculate My Value**:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n\nTotal value = 18 + 8 + 20 + 0 + 7 = 53\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThe total value of 53 from my proposed division is better than my outside offer of 50. Hence, it is a reasonable counteroffer while ensuring mistake 2 is avoided.\n\nThus, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 3, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 27. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 10 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 1 x 2 + 8 x 3\n    which is 26 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 27. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

I need to propose an offer where the value of the items I keep is greater than 27.\n\nTo accomplish this, let's calculate a potential division where my retained value is greater than 27:\n\nAssume I offer Player 2 a counteroffer of [1, 1, 2, 4, 3]:\n\n- **Items I keep**: \n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\n#### Calculate my kept items value:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n\n  **Total value = 16 + 10 + 12 + 0 + 24 = 62**\n\n62 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 27.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\n- The value of the items I keep in this counteroffer is 62, which is much better than my outside offer (27).\n- This offer represents a beneficial counteroffer that could be acceptable in negotiation strategy terms.\n\nThus, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 4, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 67. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 84 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 8 x 6 + 6 x 3\n    which is 66 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 67. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 2, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 3, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 2 x 6 + 5 x 3 + 6 x 3 + 8 x 4\n    which is 77 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 78. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Therefore, I need to reallocate to improve upon this.\n\n   Trying another allocation:\n   - Keep 3 units of item 1 (total 21)\n   - Keep 0 units of item 2 (total 0)\n   - Keep 3 units of item 3 (total 15)\n   - Keep 3 units of item 4 (total 18)\n   - Keep 4 units of item 5 (total 32)\n\n   Total value = 21 + 0 + 15 + 18 + 32 = 86\n\n   This allocation exceeds my outside offer value.\n\n4) **Make a Decision:**\n\n Based on this reasoning, I will make the following counteroffer to Player 2:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 9, 1, 0, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 9 x 2 + 1 x 1 + 5 x 5\n    which is 44 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 45. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

As we are in round 2, offers will be discounted by gamma^1 = 0.9.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]: \n     - Value = 1 item 1 (10) + 1 item 2 (3) = 10 + 3 = 13\n     - Discounted value = 13 * 0.9 = 11.7, which is less than my outside offer of 23. Therefore, I shouldn't accept the current offer.\n\n   - Previous offers and the reasoning:\n     - Player 1's initial offer [2, 2, 0, 1, 1] meaning I keep [3, 2, 0, 3, 3]:\n       - Value = 3 item 1 (10) + 2 item 2 (3) + 3 item 4 (9) + 3 item 5 (3) = 30 + 6 + 27 + 9 = 72\n       - This was a reasonable opening offer for me.\n    \n   - Evaluate a potential counteroffer ensuring it's better than both the offer on the table and my outside offer:\n     - Let's try offering [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] meaning I would keep [4, 3, 0, 3, 3]:\n       - Value = 4 item 1 (10) + 3 item 2 (3) + 3 item 4 (9) + 3 item 5 (3) = 40 + 9 + 27 + 9 = 85\n       - 85 is far above my outside offer and even with discounting it remains significantly higher.\n       - Discounted value = 85 * 0.9 = 76.5\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The value of 76.5 (even when discounted) in my new counteroffer surpasses my outside offer of 23. \n   - Neither the current offer nor WALKING provides more value than this counteroffer.\n   - Therefore, I should propose this counteroffer as it maximizes my outcome without making any negotiation mistakes.\n\nGiven the above analysis, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 103. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 103. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 93 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 0, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 10 x 0 + 4 x 1\n    which is 4 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 5. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Accepting this current offer achieves a good value, particularly since any further delay into non-acceptance will result in getting just 5, due to my outside offer.\n\n4) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Given the current offer provides a substantive value advantage over my outside offer value and is better than anything offered in previous rounds, it seems strategic to accept the current deal.\n\nConsidering all these factors, accepting the current offer is optimal. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 42. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 42. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 84 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 2 x 3 + 5 x 2 + 5 x 5\n    which is 41 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 42. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 60. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 87 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 1 + 10 x 1 + 6 x 3 + 6 x 2 + 4 x 4\n    which is 59 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 60. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 54. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 54. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 66 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 5, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 4 x 4 + 3 x 5 + 5 x 3 + 7 x 1\n    which is 53 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 54. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 10 x 2 + 2 x 3 + 2 x 3 + 5 x 7\n    which is 67 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 68. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

However, this specifically influences the final outcome if further rounds occur, and since we are in round 2, it does not yet apply heavily unless we go into round 3.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - For the current offer (offered to me): [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n   - My value if I accept this offer:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n     - Total value = 7\n\n   The total value of 7 is far below my outside offer value of 95.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to propose a division where the total value of what I keep is more than 95.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The current offer is insufficient, so I won't accept it.\n   - Walking away yields 95, which is much better than the current offer of 7.\n   - Therefore, I should propose a counteroffer that ensures I get at least a value of 95.\n\nTo propose a valid and strategic counteroffer, let's emphasize keeping high-value items for me:\n\n   My optimal strategy is to seek a combination that gives me more than my outside offer value. I aim to keep high-value items, especially from items 1, 2, 3, and 5, based on my item values.\n\n   If I propose to give away items: [0, 0, 2, 1, 0], here's what I keep:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n   - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 7 = 35\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n   - 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 7 = 49\n\n   Total value = 125, which is significantly higher than 95. This avoids Mistakes 2 and 5, ensuring I don't harm my position given my outside option.\n\nBased on this analysis, my action will be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 68. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 66 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party.

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 8 x 6 + 10 x 1\n    which is 58 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 59. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "My reasoning:\n1. My outside offer guarantees me a value of 59. My value per unit for the items is: item1 = 7, item2 = 1, item3 = 5, item4 = 8, and item5 = 10. The total pool (units) is: item1 = 8, item2 = 2, item3 = 5, item4 = 9, and item5 = 4.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) means that any deal reached in later rounds is worth less (discounted) than a deal reached now. In round 1 there is no discount, so it is preferable to secure a favorable deal immediately rather than risk future rounds.\n2. In the current offer by Player 1 (i.e., you receiving [2, 1, 2, 3, 1]), my total value calculates as follows:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n\u2003\u2003\u2192 Total = 14 + 1 + 10 + 24 + 10 = 59\n\u2003\u2003This exactly matches my outside offer.\n3. Since accepting this offer yields only my fallback value, I have an incentive to try to improve my share without falling into common negotiation mistakes (such as proposing a deal that gives me less than 59).\n4. To improve my outcome, I can propose a counteroffer that nudges my allocation upward in favor of high\u2010value items. Item 5 is my highest\u2010valued unit at 10 per unit.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In the current offer I receive 1 unit of item 5; if I aim for 2 units, my gain from item 5 increases by 10 (from 10 to 20).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 To do that, I offer Player 1 the complement: for each item, they receive (total \u2212 my units). I propose to keep for myself: item1 = 2, item2 = 1, item3 = 2, item4 = 3, and item5 = 2.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Then, Player 1 would get: item1 = 8 \u2212 2 = 6, item2 = 2 \u2212 1 = 1, item3 = 5 \u2212 2 = 3, item4 = 9 \u2212 3 = 6, and item5 = 4 \u2212 2 = 2.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 My total value becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 2: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Total = 14 + 1 + 10 + 24 + 20 = 69\n5. This counteroffer improves my value (69 > 59) while still being a valid division of items. It doesn\u2019t fall into any of the mistakes \u2013 it improves upon the previous offer and ensures I get a result better than my outside option. Even if player 1 rejects and we enter a further round (with discounting to 0.9), my current offer would be worth less; hence, seeking an immediate, better outcome is justified.\n\nBased on this analysis, I now propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 1, 3, 6, 2]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 102 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 10 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 8 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 4 x 1 + 5 x 0 + 9 x 3 + 2 x 3\n    which is 37 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 38. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's evaluate the situation step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 38.\n   - My values for the items are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 2 per unit\n     - Item 2: 4 per unit\n     - Item 3: 5 per unit\n     - Item 4: 9 per unit\n     - Item 5: 2 per unit\n   - The total pool of items consists of:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) influences the negotiation, particularly as the rounds progress. However, since we are in round 2 (r = 2), the discount factor's effect is relatively small (gamma^(2-1) = 0.9).\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer:\n   - The current offer to me is [1, 2, 0, 1, 1].\n   - My total value if I accept it:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 2 = 2\n     - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - Item 3: 0 unit \u00d7 5 = 0\n     - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 2 = 2\n   - Total value = 2 + 8 + 0 + 9 + 2 = 21\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 21, which is less than my outside offer of 38.\n   - According to mistake 5, walking away from an offer worse than my outside offer is a mistake. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n   - To avoid mistake 2 and ensure I make a counteroffer worth more than my outside offer, I need to propose a better counteroffer.\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer that yields more value:\n- I could choose to propose: [2, 3, 0, 0, 3] (this means I keep [2, 2, 1, 4, 1])\n\nNow let's calculate the value if I keep that allocation:\n- Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n- Item 3: 1 units \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 9 = 36\n- Item 5: 1 units \u00d7 2 = 2\n\nTotal value if I keep [2, 2, 1, 4, 1] = 4 + 8 + 5 + 36 + 2 = 55\n\nThis value of 55 is much higher than my outside offer of 38. However, the allocation is incorrect because item units exceed their total. I should make a feasible offer within item limits.\n\nRe-evaluating the feasible counteroffer:\n- Let's try a feasible counter and recalculate:\n  - Proposed counteroffer: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] (I keep: [3, 4, 1, 3, 4])\n\nRe-calculate the value:\n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n- Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 4 = 16\n- Item 3: 1 units \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 9 = 27\n- Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 2 = 8\n\nTotal value = 6 + 16 + 5 + 27 + 8 = 62, which is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a counteroffer of [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] to maximize the value beyond my outside offer and avoid mistakes.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 1, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 8 x 4 + 8 x 1 + 5 x 2 + 7 x 3\n    which is 71 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 72. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 7 x 2 + 1 x 0 + 9 x 4 + 10 x 4\n    which is 90 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 91. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 8 x 1 + 7 x 0 + 9 x 4 + 8 x 4\n    which is 76 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 77. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 2. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 81 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 4 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 9 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 2. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, I need to find a way to at least match or, ideally, surpass this value.\n\n     Let's try:\n     - Keeping all 3 units of item 1.\n     - Keeping all 3 units of item 5.\n     - Keeping 6 units of item 3 to increase my outcome slightly above the outside offer threshold.\n\n     Calculation:\n     - 3 * 8 (item 1) = 24\n     - 6 * 4 (item 3, keeping one less than before) = 24\n     - 3 * 5 (item 5) = 15\n     Total = 24 + 24 + 15 = 63.\n\n     This approach still does not surpass my outside offer due to high value requirements. \n\n     Let me try a different balance:\n\n     - Keep 2 units of item 1.\n     - Keep 0 units of item 2.\n     - Keep 5 units of item 3.\n     - Keep 0 units of item 4.\n     - Keep 3 units of item 5.\n\n     Resulting items are:\n     - 2 * 8 (item 1) = 16\n     - 5 * 4 (item 3) = 20\n     - 3 * 5 (item 5) = 15\n     Total = 16 + 20 + 15 = 51.\n\n     This isn't feasible yet either; I need adjustments that maximize based on my highest values.\n\n     **Panel of balance**\n     - Keep 3 units of item 1.\n     - Keep 3 units of item 5.\n     - Keep 5 units of item 3.\n     - Give 3 units of item 2 and 4 units of item 4.\n\n     Calculations:\n     - 3 * 8 = 24 (Item 1)\n     - 5 * 4 = 20 (Item 3)\n     - 3 * 5 = 15 (Item 5)\n\n     Total: 24 + 20 + 15 = 59, missing the mark.\n\n     Last feasible attempt:\n\n     - Keep 2 units of item 1: 2 * 8 = 16\n     - Keep 3 units of item 3: 3 * 4 = 12\n     - Keep 1 units of item 4: 1 * 1 = 1\n     - Keep 3 units of item 5: 3 * 5 = 15\n\n     Total: 16 + 12 + 1 + 15 = 44.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 7, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 6, 4, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 10 x 5 + 10 x 6 + 10 x 4 + 7 x 6\n    which is 192 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 193. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This will affect the value if accepted, making my net gain 90% of its current value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nCurrent Value if Accepting Offer:\n- 0 of Item 1 gives 0 value\n- 0 of Item 2 gives 0 value\n- 0 of Item 3 gives 0 value\n- 0 of Item 4 gives 0 value\n- 1 of Item 5 gives 8 value\n\nTotal immediate value of accepting the current offer: \\( 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 8 = 8 \\).\nDiscounted value due to the discount factor: \\( 8 \\times 0.9 = 7.2 \\).\n\nSince 7.2 is much less than my outside offer value of 101, accepting is not a wise choice.\n\nPotential Counteroffers:\n- I need to propose some division where the items I keep result in a value greater than 101.\n\nLet's find a division that achieves this:\n\n1. **Initial Consideration**: Keep items where I have high value: Items 2, 4, and 5.\n2.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 46. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 90 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is **46**.\n   - My values for the items are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 8 per unit\n     - Item 2: 8 per unit\n     - Item 3: 10 per unit\n     - Item 4: 9 per unit\n     - Item 5: 7 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is: [5, 2, 7, 3, 3].\n   - The discount factor of 0.9 influences the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers by reducing the effective value by a multiplier of \\(0.9^{r-1}\\), where \\(r\\) is the round number. In round 1, this does not apply to my calculations directly because there's no prior offer to compare.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer, so I cannot assess an acceptance decision.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I must construct an offer where my retained value is greater than my outside offer of 46.\n   - The calculation is done by summing up the values for the items I would keep in any proposed distribution.\n\n3) **Decision making based on analysis:**\n   - Formulate a counteroffer where the total value to me is greater than 46. Let's calculate some possibilities:\n\n   For example, suppose I consider offering the other player 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 (so I keep 1, 1, 3, 2, 2):\n   - My retained items:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Item 2: 1 unit = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Item 3: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n     - Item 4: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n     - Item 5: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n   - Total value if I keep these = 8 + 8 + 30 + 18 + 14 = **78**\n\n   This is greater than my outside offer of 46. So this is a reasonable initial counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 4, 1, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 115. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 115. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 7, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 4 + 5 x 0 + 6 x 7 + 8 x 3 + 8 x 3\n    which is 114 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 115. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 4, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 2 + 8 x 4 + 8 x 2 + 7 x 2 + 3 x 4\n    which is 86 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 87. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 46. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 81 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 10 x 0 + 1 x 1 + 4 x 2 + 9 x 4\n    which is 45 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 46. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 11. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 54 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 4 x 2 + 1 x 2\n    which is 10 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 11. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 6 x 1 + 8 x 4 + 10 x 4\n    which is 78 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 79. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

So if I accept an offer, its undiscounted value must be high enough so that 0.9\u00d7(value) exceeds my fallback of 38.\n\n2. Assessing the current offer and potential counteroffers:\n\u2003\u2022 The current offer gives me [1,2,0,1,0]. My value (undiscounted) would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item1: 1\u00d79 = 9\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item2: 2\u00d74 = 8\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item3: 0\u00d710 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item4: 1\u00d76 = 6\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item5: 0\u00d77 = 0\n\u2003\u2003Total = 23; discounted value = 23\u00d70.9 = 20.7, which is far below my outside offer of 38.\n\u2003\u2022 I must design a counteroffer that improves my outcome. If I propose a division by offering Player 1 some items, my allocation is simply the remaining items. I want the total undiscounted value of what I keep to be high enough so that (value)\u00d70.9 > 38. (That means I need at least 42.22, say 43, but ideally much higher so I gain a strong surplus.)\n\u2003\u2022 One common and fair approach is a near \u201cequal\u201d split adjusted by our values. A fair division of all items would be to split the totals roughly in half. For instance, if I suggest that Player 1 gets [2,3,1,1,1], then my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item1: 5\u20132 = 3\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item2: 5\u20133 = 2\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item3: 2\u20131 = 1\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item4: 5\u20131 = 4\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item5: 4\u20131 = 3\n\u2003\u2022 My undiscounted value for that division would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item1: 3\u00d79 = 27\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item2: 2\u00d74 = 8\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item3: 1\u00d710 = 10\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item4: 4\u00d76 = 24\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 item5: 3\u00d77 = 21\n\u2003\u2003Sum = 27 + 8 + 10 + 24 + 21 = 90\u2003\u2192\u2003Discounted value = 90\u00d70.9 = 81, which is much better than 38.\n\u2003\u2022 This counteroffer does not commit any of my items that are most valuable (like item3 which I nearly keep all) and gives Player 1 a reasonable share while keeping my value high. It avoids the pitfalls (offering a division that gives me less than my fallback, or making a regressive offer compared to prior rounds).\n\n3. Final decision:\n\u2003Based on the above, I opt to propose a counteroffer that gives Player 1 [2,3,1,1,1].

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 9. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 9. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 75 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 1 x 3 + 5 x 0 + 5 x 1 + 10 x 0\n    which is 8 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 9. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I'll start by calculating different possible divisions.\n\n   Possible division scenarios (keeping in mind my outside value is 9):\n\n   Example 1:\n   Offer Player 2: 2 units of each item (I keep 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5)\n   My value = 2\u00d74 + 3\u00d71 + 1\u00d75 + 1\u00d75 + 1\u00d710 = 8 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 10 = 31\n\n   Example 2:\n   Offer Player 2: 3 items of item 1, 4 items of item 2, 2 items of item 3 (I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5)\n   My value = 1\u00d74 + 1\u00d71 + 1\u00d75 + 3\u00d75 + 3\u00d710 = 4 + 1 + 5 + 15 + 30 = 55\n\n   The second example clearly gives me a higher value than my outside offer.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 92. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 92. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 75 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 3, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 3 + 8 x 5 + 8 x 3 + 4 x 3 + 1 x 3\n    which is 91 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 92. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 9 x 1 + 3 x 2\n    which is 15 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 16. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since it's 0.9, delaying acceptance decreases the total value by 10% for each subsequent round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - For the current offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\n     - Value = (1 x 1) + (1 x 1) + (0 x 1) + (0 x 9) + (0 x 3) = 2\n     - This total value to me is significantly lower than my outside offer of 16.\n   - For potential counteroffers, let's calculate a reasonable alternative division:\n     - For example, if I keep [2, 2, 2, 1, 4], the value would be:\n       - Value = (2 x 1) + (2 x 1) + (2 x 1) + (1 x 9) + (4 x 3) = 2 + 2 + 2 + 9 + 12 = 27 (which is a total higher than my outside offer of 16)\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer of [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], would yield a value of 2, which is much less than my outside offer of 16. Thus, accepting would be a mistake.\n   - Walking away might be acceptable, but I can first propose a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than 16.\n   - Thus, I should propose a counteroffer that keeps my total value of the items I retain above my outside offer value.\n\nTo avoid mistake 2, which is making a counteroffer worse for me than my outside offer, I will propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while possibly being reasonable for Player 2. I will counteroffer with [1, 1, 3, 0, 2], allowing me to retain a good portion of the valuable item 4 and more of the total item 5.\n\nCounteroffer calculation:\n- My kept items would be [2, 2, 0, 1, 2] giving me a value:\n  - Value = (2 x 1) + (2 x 1) + (0 x 1) + (1 x 9) + (2 x 3) = 2 + 2 + 0 + 9 + 6 = 19\n\nSince 19 is greater than my outside offer value of 16, proposing this counteroffer is justifiable.\n\nTherefore, my action will be this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 2]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 5. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 5. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 3 x 1 + 8 x 0 + 5 x 0\n    which is 3 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 5. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 11.\n    Your private values are 9 for item 1, 1 for item 2, 6 for item 3, 8 for item 4, 6 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 140. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 55. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 55. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 90 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 8 x 6 + 6 x 1\n    which is 54 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 55. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
