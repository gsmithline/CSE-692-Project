Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 39. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 39. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 81 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide my initial action, I will analyze the situation according to the steps provided:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 39\n   - Values of the items to me:\n     - Item 1: 10\n     - Item 2: 3\n     - Item 3: 8\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 5\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - Item 1: 3 units\n     - Item 2: 4 units\n     - Item 3: 2 units\n     - Item 4: 9 units\n     - Item 5: 2 units\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, which affects future offers by reducing their present value. Therefore, in future rounds, the value of any offer will be multiplied by a diminishing factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There's no current offer from Player 2, so no value to calculate.\n   - I will consider a counteroffer that gives Player 2 fewer items while ensuring my retained items' total value is greater than my outside offer of 39.\n\n3) **Propose a specific counteroffer:**\n   - I want to keep a total value greater than 39 for myself.\n   - I will start by offering a minimal amount to Player 2 in order to maximize what I keep.\n\n   Let's try offering Player 2 one unit of each item initially and calculate my retained value:\n   - Remaining for me: \n     - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n     - 3 units of Item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - 8 units of Item 4 = 8 \u00d7 1 = 8\n     - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n   - Total value = 20 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 5 = 50\n\n   The total value I would retain, 50, is greater than my outside offer of 39. This ensures I am not making mistake 2. Since this offer is higher than my outside offer, I will propose this division as my initial counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Here, since I am the receiving player for the current offer, my allocation is the remainder after subtracting the offered items:\n       \u2022 Item 1: 5 \u2013 1 = 4 units \u2192 value: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n       \u2022 Item 2: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units \u2192 value: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n       \u2022 Item 3: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units \u2192 value: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n       \u2022 Item 4: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units \u2192 value: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n       \u2022 Item 5: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units \u2192 value: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n     Total value if I accept = 20 + 9 + 8 + 12 + 24 = 73.\n   - Compared to my outside offer of 38, 73 is substantially higher. \n\n3. Decision:\n   - Since the current offer yields a value of 73 (which, after discount in Round 1 remains 73) and is better than my fallback of 38, accepting is a rational and optimal choice.\n   - No counteroffer is needed, as making one might risk getting a lower present value (or stepping into any of the mistakes mentioned), and I should not walk away from a deal clearly better than my outside option.\n\nFinal action:\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I should ensure that what I propose leaving for Player 2 does not exceed the total item pool units and that my remaining share is valued higher than 123.\n\n### Calculation for Potential Offer:\nTo maximize the value of what I keep, let's test keeping more valuable items:\n\n- Scenario where I keep items with greater personal value:\n  - Give 3 units of item 1 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself: Value to me = 3 x 3 = 9.\n  - Give 0 units of item 2 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself: Value to me = 3 x 8 = 24.\n  - Give 3 units of item 3 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself: Value to me = 3 x 8 = 24.\n  - Give 2 units of item 4 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself: Value to me = 3 x 6 = 18.\n  - Give 0 units of item 5 to Player 2, keep 3 for myself: Value to me = 3 x 10 = 30.\n  - Total value to me = 9 + 24 + 24 + 18 + 30 = 105. \n\n105 is less than my outside offer of 123 but with the discount factor applying later, we need a more strategic split:\n\nTo ensure I have higher value, keep the majority of valuable items:\n\n- Adjust based on trying to maximize value:\n  - Revised split attempt: \n    - Give 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n    - Valuation:\n      - I keep 2 units of item 1: 2 x 3 = 6.\n      - I keep 1 unit of item 2: 1 x 8 = 8.\n      - I keep 3 units of item 3: 3 x 8 = 24.\n      - I keep 2 units of item 4: 2 x 6 = 12.\n      - I keep 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 10 = 10.\n      - Total value = 6 + 8 + 24 + 12 + 10 = 60 (unexpectedly still less before attempts to provide an offer that benefits more before discount effects)\n\nLet's try securing more:\n\nPropose a more equitable offer optimizing item 5 with a preference shift focused:\n\n- Keep 2 units of item 1.\n- Keep 1 unit of item 2.\n- Keep 3 units of item 3.\n- Keep 2 units of item 4.\n- Keep 2 units of item 5.\n\nHere the Player 2 preferred are reconciled:\n\n- Give Player 2: 4 (4 received), 2 (4), 3 (3), 3 (2), 1 (1).\n- Revised share, ensuring value and improving synodal sharing:\n- Finalize:\n  - {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 3, 3, 1]}\n\nThis sets my division ensuring what I get maximizes intent for pre-discount satisfaction with layered marginal attempts!

Therefore, I need a different distribution where my retained value is higher.\n\n### Revised Initial Offer:\n- Let's refine the offer to Player 2: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n  - This means I retain:\n    - Item 1: 5 units = 5 * 9 = 45\n    - Item 2: 1 unit = 1 * 1 = 1\n    - Item 3: 6 units = 6 * 7 = 42\n    - Item 4: 4 units = 4 * 5 = 20\n    - Item 5: 2 units = 2 * 7 = 14\n  - Total retained value = 45 + 1 + 42 + 20 + 14 = 122\n\nThis configuration gives me a value of 122, which is just above my outside option value of 121. \n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nThe counteroffer to Player 2 is [1, 0, 2, 1, 0] which leaves me with a total value of 122, slightly more than my outside option.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's attempt a counteroffer:\n\n- I offer: `[2, 0, 2, 1, 0]` to Player 2.\n   - This leaves me with `[6-2, 1-0, 8-2, 5-1, 2-0] = [4, 1, 6, 4, 2]` \n   - Value to me is: 4*9 + 1*1 + 6*7 + 4*5 + 2*7 = 36 + 1 + 42 + 20 + 14 = 113\n\nThis counteroffer gives me 113 value, which is less than my outside offer and should not be made. Let's adjust it so it meets a better alternative for me and looks appealing to Player 2.\n\nI will revise my offer to give a more preferred division:\n\nNew Counteroffer:\n- Offer: `[1, 0, 3, 1, 1]` to Player 2.\n   - Leaves me with: `[5, 1, 5, 4, 1]`\n   - My value: 5*9 + 1*1 + 5*7 + 4*5 + 1*7 = 45 + 1 + 35 + 20 + 7 = 108\n\nThis revised offer again doesn't reach my outside value. An efficient counter is:\n\n- Offer: `[1, 0, 2, 1, 1]`\n   - Leaves me with: `[5, 1, 6, 4, 1]`\n   - My value: 5*9 + 1*1 + 6*7 + 4*5 + 1*7 = 126\n\nThis offer achieves 126 value, which exceeds my outside offer, giving a superior option for me to propose.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 41. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, I should not ACCEPT it.\n   - WALKING away now grants me my outside offer value, which is better than the current offer.\n   - Alternatively, I can make a COUNTEROFFER that provides a value greater than 73 for me, considering the discount factor.\n\nNow, let's calculate a reasonable counteroffer:\n\nTo ensure my value remains above 73, I need to retain items with the highest values. Considering my valuations, item 4 has the highest value.\n\nTo potentially keep my value greater than 73 while offering a fair split, I could calculate a potential division:\n\nSuppose I keep:\n- 5 units of item 1 (2 to Player 2)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (2 to Player 2)\n- 2 units of item 3 (0 to Player 2)\n- 2 units of item 4 (0 to Player 2)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (0 to Player 2)\n\nValue if I keep this:\n- Item 1: 5 x 5 = 25\n- Item 2: 1 x 7 = 7\n- Item 3: 2 x 5 = 10\n- Item 4: 2 x 10 = 20\n- Item 5: 1 x 7 = 7\n- Total value = 25 + 7 + 10 + 20 + 7 = 69\n\nValue if I go for a slightly better distribution for myself while still offering a good quantity, e.g., allowing Player 2 some items:\nI want a total value greater than 73. As my current value with the selected items is slightly less, I should slightly adjust my allocation so I reach this balance.\n\nFinal counterproposal:\n- For Player 2: [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nTotal value for my share would be higher with:\n- Item 1: 5 x 5 = 25\n- Item 2: 2 x 7 = 14\n- Item 3: 2 x 5 = 10\n- Item 4: 2 x 10 = 20\n- Item 5: 0 x 7 = 0\n\nAdjusted allocation for a target value slightly above 73.\n\nTherefore, my decision is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

For example, I might propose giving:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 5 units for myself)\n     - 4 units of item 2 (keeping 2 units)\n     - 3 units of item 3 (keeping 2 units)\n     - 2 units of item 4 (keeping 2 units)\n     - 2 units of item 5 (keeping 0 units)\n\n   - Calculate my resulting value:\n     - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 8 = 40\n     - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4\n     - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - Total value = 54\n\n   - This proposition holds a value of 54 for me, which is above my outside offer of 46.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Given that the calculated total value exceeds my outside offer value and intends to keep mistakes 2, 4, and 5 at bay, I will propose the counteroffer as detailed above.\n\nHere's my action based on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 3, 2, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, since it's round 1, this hasn't yet been applied.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is currently no offer from Player 2, so I have nothing to accept.\n   - Potential counteroffers need to be considered. My remaining offer to myself should exceed 6 to avoid Mistake 2, and I should aim to maximize my return.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I must make a proposal where the retained value of items for me is higher than my outside offer (6).\n   - Calculate the best initial counteroffer that maximizes my value without being aggressive. A reasonable strategy might be to offer Player 2 fewer high-value items from my perspective and keep most of the high-value ones for myself.\n\nTo substantiate a valid counteroffer, I will perform the following analysis:\n\n- Offer Player 2 lesser parts of the more valuable items for me:\n  - Item 1: 0 to Player 2 (I keep 1, value for me = 10)\n  - Item 2: 0 to Player 2 (I keep 1, value for me = 9)\n  - Item 3: 3 to Player 2 (I keep 1, value for me = 3)\n  - Item 4: 2 to Player 2 (I keep 1, value for me = 9)\n  - Item 5: 2 to Player 2 (I keep 1, value for me = 2)\n\nTotal value for me if I keep 1xItem1 + 1xItem2 + 1xItem3 + 1xItem4 + 1xItem5:\n- 10 (Item 1) + 9 (Item 2) + 3 (Item 3) + 9 (Item 4) + 2 (Item 5) = 33\n\nSince this proposal maximizes my return, here is my counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 2, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 8. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 87 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since 47 (value of accepting current offer) is much higher than 8 (my outside offer), accepting looks advantageous.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - **Should I accept the current offer?** Yes, because the value 47 is substantially greater than my outside offer of 8.\n   - **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?** No, because 47 is much better than 8.\n   - **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?** There's no need to counteroffer since the current offer is highly favorable to me.\n\nGiven the calculations and comparison, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make my decision, let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **My outside offer value:** 79.\n   - **Values of the items:**\n     - Item 1: 2 per unit\n     - Item 2: 6 per unit\n     - Item 3: 1 per unit\n     - Item 4: 10 per unit\n     - Item 5: 3 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - Item 1: 6 units\n     - Item 2: 5 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 3 units\n     - Item 5: 5 units\n   - **Discount factor:** Affects future offers since it reduces value in later rounds. It suggests that earlier agreements can yield more value than delayed agreements due to this discounting.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer, I need to consider what to propose.\n   - **Outside offer value:** 79, meaning I should aim for an offer that gives me more than this value in round 1, considering the discount factor does not apply yet.\n   - To maximize my value in any division,\n     - I want to focus on maximizing units of items with higher value per unit to me (particularly Item 4).\n     - My goal is to get a total value greater than 79 from the division of items.\n\n3) **Propose a Counteroffer with Maximum Self-Value:**\n   - Based on my values, I should start by maximizing my units of high-value items. Let\u2019s construct an initial counteroffer where:\n     - I aim to keep more units of higher value items.\n\n   - **Example Counteroffer** (for me to evaluate):\n     - Let Player 2 have 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5, which will leave me with:\n       - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n       - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 6 = 18\n       - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n       - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n       - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n     - **Total value to me:** 6 + 18 + 2 + 20 + 9 = 55, which is less than my outside offer value. Therefore, this offer doesn't meet my needs.\n\n   - Let's try reallocating more valuable items to reach a value exceeding 79:\n     - Give 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 to Player 2, leaving me with:\n       - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 2 = 6\n       - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 6 = 18\n       - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 1 = 3\n       - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 10 = 20\n       - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n     - **Total value to me:** 6 + 18 + 3 + 20 + 9 = 56, still not enough.\n\n   - Another adjustment:\n     - Give Player 2: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5, leaving me with:\n       - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 2 = 4\n       - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 6 = 12\n       - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 1 = 2\n       - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 10 = 30\n       - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 3 = 6\n\n     - **Total value to me:** 4 + 12 + 2 + 30 + 6 = 54, still below 79.\n\n   - Considering these attempts, to make a counteroffer satisfying my needs:\n     - Let Player 2 have: 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. I keep:\n       - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n       - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n       - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n\n     - **My total value is:** 6 + 12 + 2 + 20 + 15 = 55, still under.\n\n   - Going extreme for keeping items I value:\n     - Give: 5, 3, 2, 1, 4, leaving me:\n       - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n       - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n       - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\n     - **Total value to me:** 2 + 12 + 1 + 20 + 3 = 38, worse attempt.\n\n   - Adjust small units for final reflective offer:\n     - Give: 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, leaving me:\n       - Item 1: 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n       - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n       - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n       - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n       - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n\n     - **My total is:** 10 + 24 + 3 + 30 + 15 = 82, acceptable before discount.\n     - Offer surpassing outsider offer but usable.\n\n4) **Chosen Action:**  \n   - Since no perfect offer equal to 79 has been identified to provoke acceptance, an optimal strategic starting point is:  \n   - **COUNTEROFFER:** Offering small generous units initially to hold space in high view items.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}",

In round 2, the value will be multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{1} = 0.9 \\).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current Offer: I get [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], which provides:\n     - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - Total value = 1\n     - Discounted value = 1 \u00d7 0.9 = 0.9, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 79.\n   - Counteroffer Calculations:\n     - To make a meaningful counteroffer, it should yield more to me than my outside offer when applying a discount of 0.9.\n     - Let's calculate a potential counteroffer that keeps a high-value distribution for me:\n       - Aim for a value higher than my outside offer of 79/0.9 \u2248 87.78 (because we're in round 2, I need to compensate for future discounting)\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is far lower in value compared to my outside offer. Accepting it would lead to substantial losses.\n   - My initial offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], assuming I keep the rest, gives me value:\n     - Item 1: 5 units, value = 10 \n     - Item 2: 4 units, value = 24\n     - Item 3: 3 units, value = 3\n     - Item 4: 3 units, value = 30\n     - Item 5: 5 units, value = 15\n     - Total = 82\n     - Discounted Total in Round 2 = 82 \u00d7 0.9 \u2248 73.8, less than my outside offer\n   - Let's try a stronger counteroffer:\n     - Let's offer [3, 1, 0, 0, 1] to Player 2, keeping the rest for myself:\n     - What I keep:\n       - Item 1: 3 units = 6\n       - Item 2: 4 units = 24 \n       - Item 3: 3 units = 3\n       - Item 4: 3 units = 30\n       - Item 5: 4 units = 12\n       - Total = 75\n       - Discounted Total = 75 \u00d7 0.9 = 67.5, still lower than the outside offer\n\nGiven these attempts, I don't seem to achieve a value over 79 even with a higher balance item approach. \n\nTherefore, the best option based on maximizing value would be to WALK away and accept the outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To evaluate my decision-making in this negotiation, let's step through the analytical process outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1.\n   - My values per unit of items are as follows: \n     - Item 1: 3 \n     - Item 2: 8 \n     - Item 3: 10 \n     - Item 4: 3 \n     - Item 5: 5 \n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 7 units of item 1 \n     - 3 units of item 2 \n     - 3 units of item 3 \n     - 5 units of item 4 \n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor is 0.9, which means the later rounds would slightly decrease the value of offers. However, round 1 is not affected by this discount yet, so I will focus on maximizing value without worrying about discounting right now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - As it's round 1, there is no current offer from Player 2.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I must consider various divisions and calculate my net value:\n     - If I keep all items (which is not feasible in negotiation), my potential value is 105.\n     - I need to propose something reasonable that maximizes my retained value while still offering Player 2 a meaningful share.\n\n   Let's calculate the value for proposing a division where I retain most of the high-value items for myself. I will make an offer, for instance, where:\n   - I offer Player 2: \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis proposed offer means I retain:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- Total value to me: 70\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The potential value of my proposed division (70) is significantly higher than my outside offer (1).\n   - This means the proposed offer is favorable to me, assuming Player 2 finds it reasonable enough to accept or counter with a favorable option.\n\nGiven these steps, my optimal action is to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my retained value and provides Player 2 with an offer that might be seen as reasonable for negotiation:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 55. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 78 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, I should not accept it.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Since the current offer is worse for me than my outside offer, I should not accept it.\n   - Walking away would secure my outside offer value, which is 76.\n   - Instead of walking away immediately, I can consider making a better counteroffer to maximize my value.\n\n   **Potential Counteroffer Calculation:**\n   - If I propose a counteroffer, it must be better than my outside offer.\n   - Let's try maximizing my value under some reasonable conditions:\n\n   Suppose I want to keep more valuable items to myself, aiming to exceed my outside offer value:\n   - Keep all units of item 3 (3 units), 2 units of item 5, and 1 unit of item 4.\n   - This leaves me sending 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n\n   - Evaluate this counteroffer:\n     - I would get: \n       - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n       - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n       - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n       - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - Total value = 30 + 4 + 14 = 48\n\n   However, this value is still less than my outside offer. I must keep trying other combinations that maximize my end without diminishing the offer's feasibility for Player 2.\n\n   - If I take 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5, with no units of item 1 (which doesn't exist):\n     - I would get:\n       - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n       - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n       - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n       - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n     - Total value = 7 + 30 + 8 + 21 = 66\n\n   This value is still less than 76. Let's propose another adjustment:\n\n   - I should aim to keep the high-value items (item 3) in a way that offers a good compromise to Player 2:\n\n   If I decide to keep all units of item 3 and 4 units of item 5, with 3 units of item 4 (still trying new combinations to maximize value):\n     - This new offer (to Player 2): [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n     (Based on the remaining items: 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 for item 3, 1 for item 4, and 2 for item 5)\n\n   If this calculation doesn't yield a higher value than my outside offer, walking away remains a strategic decision.\n\nGiven this analysis, I should decide to walk away, as reaching a feasible counteroffer exceeding the outside offer seems impractical after several strong trials. Thus, let's take the secured option since none equally approached my outside offer of 76 effectively.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 71. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 96 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To make a decision, I'll walk through the analysis step-by-step as suggested.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 111.\n  \n- **Values of the items:** \n  - Item 1: 10 (per unit)\n  - Item 2: 10 (per unit)\n  - Item 3: 8 (per unit)\n  - Item 4: 5 (per unit)\n  - Item 5: 9 (per unit, but there are zero units available)\n\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 8 units\n  - Item 5: 0 units\n\n- **Discount factor influence:** \n  - The discount factor is 0.9, but since it's round 1, the discounting effect is minimal (discount factor is applied in later rounds).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer value:** There is no current offer to evaluate.\n  \n- **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an initial offer. I must ensure that I retain a value greater than 111 in any response:\n\n  Let's consider keeping most of the higher-valued items for myself:\n\n  - **Example Offer to Player 2** (This offer maximizes my retention value):\n\n    - **Offer all of Item 4 (8 units) to Player 2**: \n      - Item 1: 0 to Player 2 (3 for me) \n      - Item 2: 0 to Player 2 (3 for me) \n      - Item 3: 0 to Player 2 (3 for me) \n      - Item 4: 8 to Player 2 (0 for me) \n      - Item 5: 0 to Player 2 (0 for me)\n\n  - **Value to me with this division**: \n    - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 x 10 = 30\n    - 3 units of Item 2 = 3 x 10 = 30\n    - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 x 8 = 24\n    - 0 units of Item 4 = 0 x 5 = 0\n    - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 x 9 = 0\n    - Total = 30 + 30 + 24 + 0 + 0 = 84\n\n  This total of 84 is below my outside offer of 111. Based on this, I need to offer fewer units of the high-value items.\n\n  **Revised Offer to Player 2**:\n\n  To ensure I do not fall below the outside offer, I'll only offer fewer of the less valuable items (item 4):\n\n  - **Example Revised Offer**:\n  \n    - Item 1: 1 to Player 2 (2 for me)\n    - Item 2: 1 to Player 2 (2 for me)\n    - Item 3: 1 to Player 2 (2 for me)\n    - Item 4: 6 to Player 2 (2 for me)\n    - Item 5: 0 to Player 2 (0 for me)\n\n  - **Value to me with this division**: \n    - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 x 10 = 20\n    - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 x 10 = 20\n    - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 x 8 = 16\n    - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 x 5 = 10\n    - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 x 9 = 0\n    - Total = 20 + 20 + 16 + 10 + 0 = 66\n\n  This implies I can offer a little more for a viable counteroffer but still retain value above my outside offer when accounting for acceptance by the other player.\n\n### Make a decision\n\nGiven this, the best initial offer strategy could be to concede more item 4 but keep most of items 1, 2, and 3 to avoid going below my outside offer value section below due to discounting.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 6, 0]}\n```",

It's important to make an offer that exceeds my outside offer value when considering this factor.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer Value**: There is no current offer on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to ensure the total value of what I keep is greater than my outside offer (12). Here's one such example of an allocation:\n\n  - Offer Player 2: \n    - 1 unit of item 1\n    - 2 units of item 2\n    - 1 unit of item 3\n    - 2 units of item 4\n    - 1 unit of item 5\n  \n  - I Keep:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 valued at 3\n    - 2 units of item 2 valued at 16\n    - 3 units of item 3 valued at 18\n    - 3 units of item 4 valued at 21\n    - 1 unit of item 5 valued at 6\n\n  - Total Value to Me: 3 + 16 + 18 + 21 + 6 = 64\n\nThis division provides me with a total value of 64, which is much higher than my outside offer of 12.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nGiven the analysis above, it would be beneficial to make a counteroffer that provides me with a value well above my outside offer. I should avoid mistakes such as making an offer worse than my outside offer or proposing to give everything or nothing, which would not be strategically sound.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to make a counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

In comparing accepting the current offer or waiting, I must ensure that any division I get gives me a value at least equal to my fallback (74).\n\n2) Assessing the offers:\n\u2022 The current offer (from Player 1) gives me [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. My value from that is:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 1\u00d71 = 1\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 2\u00d76 = 12\n\u2003\u2003Item3: 1\u00d79 = 9\n\u2003\u2003Item4: 2\u00d71 = 2\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 1\u00d77 = 7\n\u2003\u2003Total = 1+12+9+2+7 = 31,\nwhich is far below my outside offer of 74.\n\u2022 To do better, I need to propose a counteroffer in which my allocation (i.e. items I keep) has a value at least 74. Since keeping everything gives value 81, I can at most \u201cgive away\u201d items worth up to 7 in value. Preferably I give away items that are relatively \u201ccheap\u201d for me (i.e. low value per unit) so I lose little.\n\u2022 The cheapest items are item1 and item4 (each unit worth 1). For example, giving away all of item1 (worth 2) and 3 units of item4 (worth 3) would transfer 2+3 = 5 value. Keeping everything else then yields: \n\u2003\u2003My allocation = [0, 4, 4, 2, 2] with total value = 0+24+36+2+14 = 76. (Calculation: item2: 4\u00d76=24; item3: 4\u00d79=36; item5: 2\u00d77=14.)\n\u2022 This allocation gives me 76 which exceeds 74, ensuring I do not fall below my fallback.\n\u2022 As a counteroffer, I must specify what I give to Player 1. Offering player1 [2, 0, 0, 3, 0] means:\n\u2003\u2003Player 1 gets:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 2 (all units)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 3 (out of 5 units),\n\u2003\u2003and I keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item1: 0, item2: 4, item3: 4, item4: 5\u20133=2, item5: 2.\n\u2022 My kept share sums to a value of 0 + 24 + 36 + 2 + 14 = 76. This avoids Mistake 2 (keeping less than my fallback) and tries to maximize my outcome while offering something (namely, items that are not very valuable to me) to Player 1.\n\n3) Decision:\n\u2022 The current offer yields only 31 value for me, which is unacceptable.\n\u2022 Walking away would give me 74.\n\u2022 To do better, I propose a counteroffer that gives me 76.\n\u2022 Therefore, I will counteroffer by giving Player 1 the items [2, 0, 0, 3, 0]. \n\nMy final action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 3, 0]}",

                    "response": "To determine the best action to take, let's evaluate the current situation and offers step by step:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - My outside offer value: 12\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 3\n     - Item 2: 8\n     - Item 3: 6\n     - Item 4: 7\n     - Item 5: 6\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 4 units\n     - Item 3: 4 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 2 units\n   - The discount factor (gamma) influences the value of future offers by reducing their present value as rounds continue. Since we\u2019re in round 2, the discount factor is less impactful than in round 3.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current offer (from Player 2): [2, 0, 0, 3, 0]**\n     - Calculating my value if I accept:\n       - Item 1: 2 units * 3 = 6\n       - Item 2: 0 units * 8 = 0\n       - Item 3: 0 units * 6 = 0\n       - Item 4: 3 units * 7 = 21\n       - Item 5: 0 units * 6 = 0\n       - Total value = 6 + 0 + 0 + 21 + 0 = 27\n     - Given the value of 27, it's much higher than my outside offer of 12. Accepting this offer yields a better outcome than walking away.\n   \n   - **Potential counteroffer:**\n     - I should aim for a counteroffer that maximizes my value.\n     - One potential counteroffer could be to improve on my initial offer or Player 2's offer, considering the items' values to me.\n     - A balanced approach that improves my haul could be offering [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] to Player 2, leaving me with:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit * 3 = 3\n       - Item 2: 3 units * 8 = 24\n       - Item 3: 2 units * 6 = 12\n       - Item 4: 4 units * 7 = 28\n       - Item 5: 1 unit * 6 = 6\n       - Total value = 3 + 24 + 12 + 28 + 6 = 73\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer provides me with a total value of 27, which is more than double my outside offer. Given that any counteroffers could later be rejected or worsened due to Player 2's strategic interests and tactics, accepting this offer capitalizes on a favorable outcome now.\n   - Walking away is not beneficial as it yields a lower value than the current offer.\n   - Making a counteroffer is possible, but there's no guarantee it will be accepted, especially when the current offer already substantially exceeds the outside offer value.\n\nConsidering all the analysis above, the smartest move is to:\n   \n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

To make sure I value more than my outside offer:\n- Adjust allocation: \n  - Keep 3 units of item 1 (value = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9)\n  - Keep 3 units of item 2 (value = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6)\n  - Keep 9 units of item 3 (value = 9 \u00d7 5 = 45)\n  - Keep 5 units of item 4 (value = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20)\n  - Keep 1 unit of item 5 (value = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3)\n\n- Total value = 9 + 6 + 45 + 20 + 3 = 83\n\nReassessing with an additional allocation:\n  - Keep 4 units of item 1 (value = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12)\n  - Keep 5 units of item 2 (value = 5 \u00d7 2 = 10)\n  - Keep 9 units of item 3 (value = 9 \u00d7 5 = 45)\n  - Keep 6 units of item 4 (value = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24)\n  - Keep 1 unit of item 5 (value = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3)\n\n- Total value = 12 + 10 + 45 + 24 + 3 = 94\n\nOffer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 unit of item 5. \n\nTo achieve a value of at least my outside offer of 91, my total value with this allocation would be 94, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\nBased on my calculations, I choose to propose an initial offer where Player 2 receives:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 unit of item 5\n\nThis should ensure my value is above the outside offer value of 91.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

For instance, I can take:\n\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n- 9 units of item 3: 9 \u00d7 5 = 45\n- 6 units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 4 = 24\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\nCalculating the total:\n- Total value: 9 + 8 + 45 + 24 + 3 = 89\n- Discounted value for round 2 = 89 \u00d7 0.9 = 80.1\n\nAlthough this offer is less than my outside offer, it's important to make the best possible offer without going below my outside offer in terms of bargaining strategy. Hence, I'll propose a different division that might be more appealing to both sides yet still above my outside offer value.\n\nTherefore, my next best move is to walk away with a guaranteed outside offer as no immediate counteroffer meets or exceeds my needs in this discounted round. It would be suboptimal to propose severely reduced values and I may not have better leverage to force an acceptable counteroffer.\n\nThus, the cautious strategic decision here would be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This division proposal is: \n- Offer Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n\nIn this scenario, I would keep:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n- 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 9 = 54\n\nTotal value if this offer is accepted = 12 + 27 + 54 = 93.\n\nSince this total value (93) is substantially higher than my outside offer value of 7, this counteroffer is beneficial unless Player 2 significantly objects. \n\nTherefore, my action is to make this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 8, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I need to revise to keep more value for myself.\n\n   Adjust proposal:\n   - Give Player 2: [2 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5]\n\n   Recalculate:\n   - My items: [6 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 4 of item 5]\n   - Value to me:\n     - Item 1: 6 \u00d7 10 = 60\n     - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n     - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n     - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n     - Total value to me = 121\n\n   This is still below my outside offer.

Holding most of item 1 might increase total value.\n\n   Strategic decision on the final offer:\n   - Aim to minimize significant loss by adjusting further but approaching balanced sharing, expecting Player 2 response aligns better.\n\n   Final balanced offer attempting to negotiate:\n   - Give Player 2: [2 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5]\n\n   Revised calculate:\n   - My items: [6 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 4 of item 5]\n   - Value to me:\n     - Item 1: 6 \u00d7 10 = 60\n     - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n     - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n     - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n     - Total value to me = 110\n\n   Counteroffer requires a higher retention percentage to remain advantageous. Soften request for enhancement.\n\n   Optimal initial proposal within calculated reasoning to maximize returns post-negotiation:\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Current adjustments suggest maintaining strong allocations:\n   - Given my calculations, my strategy necessitates strong retention:\n   - Offer better equilibrium to maintain negotiation confidence.\n\n   Here is the crafted counteroffer:\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 2, 1]} \n\n   This leaves a buffered option balancing potential ratified compromise with similar parallel opportunities.\n",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 17. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 78 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I have to ensure the offer I propose gives me more than my outside offer value of 114.\n  2. Since my total value is 122, I must propose an offer that doesn't reduce my retained value below 114.\n\nLet's calculate retained value for a balanced offer where I don't give too much:\n\n**Example offer to Player 2:**\n- Offer them: \n  - 1 unit of item 1 (1 * 1 = 1)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (2 * 2 = 4)\n  - 0 units of item 3 (0 * 10 = 0)\n  - 3 units of item 4 (3 * 7 = 21)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (3 * 6 = 18)\n\n**Items I keep:**\n- 1 unit of item 1 (1 * 1 = 1)\n- 2 units of item 2 (2 * 2 = 4)\n- 4 units of item 3 (4 * 10 = 40)\n- 3 units of item 4 (3 * 7 = 21)\n- 2 units of item 5 (2 * 6 = 12)\n\n**Total retained value =** 1 + 4 + 40 + 21 + 12 = 78\n\nThis means the proposed counteroffer would result in my value being less than my outside offer (114), indicating that it is not a valid proposal.\n\nI will keep adjusting and balancing my offer to maximize my retained value while exceeding 114.\n\n### Decision:\nA potential valid counteroffer that maximizes the retained value for me:\n\n- I offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1 \n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4 (21 value for me)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (18 value for me)\n  \n**Items I keep:**\n- 2 unit of item 1 (2 * 1 = 2)\n- 4 units of item 2 (4 * 2 = 8)\n- 4 units of item 3 (4 * 10 = 40)\n- 3 units of item 4 (3 * 7 = 21)\n- 2 units of item 5 (2 * 6 = 12)\n\n**Total retained value =** 2 + 8 + 40 + 21 + 12 = 83, which exceeds the outside offer of 114, indicating the above offer must be revised.\n\nGiven my previous attempt was invalid since it was lower than 114, I'll adjust to ensure any error was minimized by offering:\n\n- 0 units of item 1 (retaining 2)\n- 0 units of item 2 (Retaining all 4)\n- 0 units of item 3 (retaining 4)\n- 3 units of item 4 (retaining 3)\n- 2 units of item 5 (retaining 1)\n\nWith a modified offer retaining previous 83 + the my offer were reduce, implies\n\nReasoning implies, better to converge initially to any easier or even split as:\n\n- I'll offer Player 2\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 1 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\nAdjusting to:\n- {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]}",

However, with the discount factor in consideration (since this is round 2), the effective value becomes 33 * 0.9 = 29.7, which is still significantly less than my outside offer value of 114.\n\n3. **Evaluate potential counteroffers:**\n   - I need to ensure any offer I propose will result in a value greater than 114 after accounting for the discount factor.\n   - I should attempt to keep a composition of items that yields at least 114/0.9 \u2248 126.7 in this round.\n   - Considering the values of the items, a significant amount of item 3 (10 value) and item 4 (7 value) are needed to reach a high enough personal value.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer that maximizes these high-value items:\n   - Offer Player 2 the remaining lower-valued items while proposing to keep more of the high-value items. A sensible counteroffer could be:\n     - Offer Player 2: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\n   - Keeping for myself: [1, 2, 3, 5, 3]\n     - Value of item 1 = 1 unit * 1 = 1\n     - Value of item 2 = 2 units * 2 = 4\n     - Value of item 3 = 3 units * 10 = 30\n     - Value of item 4 = 5 units * 7 = 35\n     - Value of item 5 = 3 units * 6 = 18\n     - Total value = 1 + 4 + 30 + 35 + 18 = 88\n\n   With the discount factor applied from reaching round 2: 88 * 0.9 = 79.2, this does not exceed my outside offer.\n\n   I must propose an even stronger counteroffer to exceed 126.7 in actual value (prior to discounting), ensuring to include more units of the items with high value per unit like item 3 and 4.\n\nAfter careful analysis, since I cannot construct a viable counteroffer that surpasses my outside offer given the constraints and maximizing for my higher-valued items, I will choose to walk away as current offers do not meet my benchmark.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Let's make another adjustment.\n\nDecision based on iterations and calculations:\n- Proposed Offer: [0, 3, 1, 1, 0]\n\n**My new kept set**:\n- Units of Item 1 kept: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n- Units of Item 2 kept: 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n- Units of Item 3 kept: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- Units of Item 4 kept: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- Units of Item 5 kept: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- **Total value**: 36 + 16 + 2 + 6 + 20 = 80\n\nThis is still not above the outside offer of 84, so propose more balanced:\n\nFinal proposal for maximization:\n- Offer 0 units of Item 5\n- Offer 0 units of Item 1\n- Offer 3 units of Item 2\n- Offer 2 unit of Item 3\n- Offer 3 units of Item 4\n\n**My kept set**:\n- Units of Item 1 kept: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n- Units of Item 2 kept: 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n- Units of Item 3 kept: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- Units of Item 4 kept: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- Units of Item 5 kept: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- **Total value**: 36 + 16 + 1 + 0 + 20 = 73\n\nThis theoretical value isn't above 84 either without further reducing items from the opponent which are lesser in value for us and rises the critical items. Let's use simpler model:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of Item 1\n  - 4 units of Item 2\n  - 1 units of Item 3\n  - 3 units of Item 4\n  - 0 units of Item 5\n\n**My kept set**:\n- Units of Item 1 kept: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n- Units of Item 2 kept: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n- Units of Item 3 kept: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- Units of Item 4 kept: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- Units of Item 5 kept: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- **Total value**: 36 + 12 + 2 + 0 + 20 = 70\nStill adjusting from above.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\nTo maximize my value, ensuring more than 84:\nFinal proposal:\n- Proposed Offer: [0, 4, 2, 2, 0] \n\n**I propose to reduce initial units and keep self higher:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of Item 1\n  - 1 units of Item 2\n  - 1 units of Item 3\n  - 1 units of Item 4\n  - 0 units of Item 5\n\n- In keeping these accounted above corrects aim by small adjustments between higher vs lower items on both sides.\n- **Total value** reverts close to maximization efforts with extended logic-based rounds.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]} \nEnd proposal is ensuring transition from proving example of having reduction waves to achieving and drawing solution across any shortfalls.",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine my next action, let's go through the steps systematically:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 24.\n   - The value of items to me is: \n     - Item 1: 3 per unit\n     - Item 2: 3 per unit\n     - Item 3: 2 per unit\n     - Item 4: 6 per unit\n     - Item 5: 3 per unit\n   - Total pool of items consists of:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 2, any value I receive from a deal should be multiplied by 0.9 to find its value in present terms.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** I receive [2, 3, 1, 0, 0].\n     - Value of current offer: \n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n     - Total value = 6 + 9 + 2 = 17\n     - Adjusted for discount factor (0.9^1) = 17 \u00d7 0.9 = 15.3\n\n   - **Comparison:** My outside offer is 24. The discounted value of accepting the current offer is 15.3, which is less than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake as it is worse than my outside offer (Mistake 4).\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n   - Given the current offer is worth less than my outside offer, I should not accept it.\n   - I should counteroffer to try and maximize my value above 24 and account for the bargaining discount.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffer:**\n     - My goal is to get a value greater than 24 after accounting for the discount.\n     - One reasonable counteroffer is to take at least all of the higher value items (item 4) and some portions of other items in such a way that moving closer to my outside offer isn't unreasonable.\n     - Aim to keep at least item 4 which offers high value due to its multiplication, and reorganize my offer accordingly:\n\n     Let's propose giving [0, 1, 0, 1, 2] to Player 2, keeping [2, 2, 1, 1, 1] for myself which has a value calculated as follows:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 6\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 6\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 2\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 6\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 3\n   - Total value accumulated = 23\n   - Adjusted for discount factor = 23 \u00d7 0.9 = 20.7\n\n   Even if it\u2019s below the outside offer, it\u2019s a better distribution than initially. However, this closely tries to bring in the units that compound to value near my outside offer. Given the strategic nature of negotiations and testing, this allocation likely continues to prompt a beneficial exchange.\n\nHence, the next step is to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 43. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 105 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 36. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 90 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This is higher than my outside offer value of 26, providing a good margin. The offer to Player 2 needs to be reasonable to ensure they might consider it, but it robustly protects my value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n- Should I accept any current offer? Not applicable, as there is no offer.\n- Should I walk away? No, because the potential offer I plan to make exceeds my outside offer.\n- Propose a specific counteroffer:\n\nGiven my calculations, I plan to offer Player 2 the following division to initiate the negotiation:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 2, 0]}\n```\n\nThis offer allows me to retain a significant value greater than my outside offer, while still making a proposal to Player 2.",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 56. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 102 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

I'll aim to keep a significant portion of high-value items and a reasonable amount of others to try to exceed the value of 53 comfortably.\n\n   Let's consider an offer:\n   - Offer Player 2:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit\n     - Item 2: 2 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 3 units\n     - Item 5: 0 units\n\n   This means I keep:\n   - Item 1: 2 units (worth 2 \u00d7 5 = 10)\n   - Item 2: 3 units (worth 3 \u00d7 5 = 15)\n   - Item 3: 3 units (worth 3 \u00d7 5 = 15)\n   - Item 4: 2 units (worth 2 \u00d7 4 = 8)\n   - Item 5: 1 unit (worth 1 \u00d7 6 = 6)\n\n   Total value of my kept items = 10 + 15 + 15 + 8 + 6 = 54.\n\n   This offer gives me a total value of 54 which is slightly above my outside offer of 53.\n\nGiven this analysis, my initial action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 3, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

So, Mistake 4 and Mistake 5 are avoided if I accept.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on analysis**:\n   - The current offer provides a value of 37, which is much better than my outside offer of 11.\n   - Accepting the current offer avoids Mistake 5 (walking away from a better offer) and is a rational choice based on the current setup.\n\nTherefore, given the current offer provides a higher value than my outside offer, the best decision is to accept it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's perform a step-by-step analysis of the current situation and evaluate the possible actions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My guaranteed fallback if the negotiation fails is 121.\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 3 units available, value per unit = 3.\n  - Item 2: 6 units available, value per unit = 7.\n  - Item 3: 6 units available, value per unit = 4.\n  - Item 4: 4 units available, value per unit = 9.\n  - Item 5: 2 units available, value per unit = 9.\n  - Total pool value = 129.\n- **Discount Factor**: As this is round 2, the discount factor does not yet apply, but it will in the next round if needed.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer:\nThe current offer from Player 2 is [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], meaning I would get all 6 units of item 2.\n\n- Value if I accept it:\n  - 0 units of Item 1 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n  - 6 units of Item 2 = 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n  - 0 units of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n  - 0 units of Item 4 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n  - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n  - Total value = 42\n\nThis value (42) is much less than my outside offer (121), so the current offer is not appealing.\n\n#### Evaluate a Potential Counteroffer:\nLet's consider a counteroffer where the division provides me with a value greater than 121.\n\nSince the total value of all items is 129, I want to ensure I retain items that give me a value comfortably above 121.\n\nOne possible counteroffer:\n- Offer [0, 2, 2, 0, 0] to Player 2.\n  \n  Calculation for my value:\n  - I would keep:\n    - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n    - 4 units of Item 2 = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n    - 4 units of Item 3 = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n    - 4 units of Item 4 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n    - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n    - Total value I keep: 107\n\nThis counteroffer is still less than my outside offer. Hence, I need to reconsider to ensure my value exceeds 121.\n\nPerhaps a better counteroffer:\n\n- Offer [0, 0, 3, 0, 0] to Player 2.\n\n  Calculation for my value:\n  - I would keep:\n    - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n    - 6 units of Item 2 = 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n    - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n    - 4 units of Item 4 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n    - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n    - Total value I keep: 117\n\nThis still doesn't meet the outside offer value. To exceed 121, I should change again:\n\nFinal counteroffer to give me more value:\n\n- Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2.\n\n  Calculation for my value:\n  - I would keep all units with the maximum immediate value:\n    - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n    - 6 units of Item 2 = 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n    - 6 units of Item 3 = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24\n    - 4 units of Item 4 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n    - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n    - Total value I keep: 129\n\nThis counteroffer exceeds my outside offer value and shares no items with Player 2, which could be strategic to push negotiations or signal firm valuation needs.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that my current counteroffer gives me a value that achieves my required minimum value (aligning potentially with their values seen in the previous rounds), the optimal strategy seems to be leaving robust room for continued negotiations. However, a stronger viable counter offer like: \n\n- Offer [0, 5, 0, 2, 0] to strategically balance values higher than 121 for retention:\n\n- Value calculation:\n  - I keep 6 of Item 3 = 24\n  - Keep Item 1 = 9\n  - Keep Item 4 = 18\n  - Keep Item 2 = 7\n  - Value = 129 value for me\n\nI will propose this offer to see if it pushes negotiations effectively.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

This discount factor will reduce the value of any deal.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer on the table**: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n  - This means Player 2 is offering me 1 unit of item 2.\n  - My value for this offer: 1 unit of item 2 = 7.\n  - After applying the round 3 discount factor (0.81), the present value of accepting is 7 * 0.81 = 5.67.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers**:\n  - I need to make a counteroffer that has a value greater than my outside offer (121), discounted by the factor in round 3.\n\n  Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep some valuable units to maximize my outcome.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Since it is currently round 1, there is no discount (gamma^0 = 1).\n\n2) Assess the value of potential offers:\n   - No current offer is on the table.\n   - I need to propose an initial offer that maximizes my value while being better than my outside offer of 21.\n   - To avoid a mistake, I must ensure any offer I propose gives me a value greater than 21.\n\nLet's calculate the value to me if I keep maximum units of higher value items and offer the rest to Player 2:\n\n  One possible counteroffer consideration:\n   - Give Player 2: Item 1: 0, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 1\n\n  My share would then be:\n   - Item 1: 3, value = 3 * 5 = 15\n   - Item 2: 1, value = 1 * 8 = 8\n   - Item 3: 3, value = 3 * 4 = 12\n   - Item 4: 2, value = 2 * 2 = 4\n   - Item 5: 2, value = 2 * 10 = 20\n   - Total value = 15 + 8 + 12 + 4 + 20 = 59\n\nThis proposed division gives me a total value of 59, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 21.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n- I should propose the counteroffer, as it results in a value of 59, much higher than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I'll analyze the situation and make a proposal:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 74.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 6\n     - Item 2: 8\n     - Item 3: 3\n     - Item 4: 2\n     - Item 5: 1\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 6 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) influences the decision as follows: the earlier a deal is reached, the less the value is reduced. If I get a deal in round 1, there's no discount.\n\n2) **Assess potential counteroffers:**\n   - I'm maximizing value by keeping more of the items that have higher values for me. Since the process requires giving Player 2 some units, making a counteroffer:\n     - If I give Player 2 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5:\n       - I would keep: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n       - My value from these is:\n         - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n         - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n         - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n         - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n         - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n       - Total value = 61\n   - This proposed split offers me a total value of 61, which is below my outside offer of 74. Therefore, I need to retain a little more value.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - To maximize my outcome and avoid reaching the value of my outside offer, I should offer slightly fewer units to Player 2 in a way that maintains my values higher.\n   - Trying to keep the total value above 74, considering the asymmetry in values, I adjust my offer as follows:\n\n   Offer 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\n   - Calculating again with this offer:\n     - I would keep: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n     - Values:\n       - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n       - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n       - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n       - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - Total value = 74\n\nThis gives me a total of 74, which matches my outside offer.

Here's a possible split aiming to secure a value above 74 while ensuring a reasonable division for negotiation purposes:\n\nNew Counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 2: [3, 3, 0, 4, 0] (Meaning I keep [4, 3, 4, 2, 2]).\n\nCalculate my value for keeping: [4, 3, 4, 2, 2]\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- Total value = 24 + 24 + 12 + 4 + 2 = 66\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't exceed my outside offer of 74. Let's tweak further for a viable alternative:\n\nOffer Player 2: [3, 2, 1, 3, 1] (Meaning I keep [4, 4, 3, 3, 1]).\n\nCalculate my value:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- Total value = 24 + 32 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 72\n\nWhile this value is below 74, with considering additional aspects like trading off more, new offer improvements, compromises, or the discount factor for a stable outcome finalizing now, I confirm:\n\nOffer Player 2: [3, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\nStill not above 74 for a genuine step, I'll take:\n- {\"action\": \"WALK\"} as the smart choice with impending guarantee rather than a chance gamble beyond comparable draws.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 7. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 48 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Accepting a strong offer early could avoid value loss due to the discount factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**:\n   - No current offer exists.\n   - For potential counteroffers, let's evaluate a few scenarios:\n     - If I keep all items, I get:\n       - (5 \u00d7 3) + (10 \u00d7 6) + (1 \u00d7 5) + (3 \u00d7 10) + (6 \u00d7 10) = 15 + 60 + 5 + 30 + 60 = 170\n     - I need to make sure my proposal retains at least 115 in value.\n     - Possible offer could be:\n       - Offer 3 units of Item 1 (value kept: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6)\n       - Offer 7 units of Item 2 (value kept: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18)\n       - Offer 1 unit of Item 3 (value kept: 0 \u00d7 5 = 0)\n       - Offer 1 unit of Item 4 (value kept: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20)\n       - Offer 1 unit of Item 5 (value kept: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50)\n     - Total retained value: 6 + 18 + 0 + 20 + 50 = 94\n   - This counteroffer retains less value than my outside option (115), so I should aim for a different allocation.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis**:\n   - Initial analysis suggests keeping around two units of Item 4 and five units of Item 5, along with other strategic units, might be valuable:\n     - Offer 3 units of Item 1, 5 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 4 units of Item 5:\n       - Value retained: 6 + 30 + 0 + 20 + 20 = 76\n   - I'm still not reaching my outside offer value.\n\nLet me tweak my offer to reach at least a value of 115.\n\nA more promising arrangement is:\n   - Offer 2 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5.\n   - Value I keep: \n     - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - 7 units of Item 2 = 7 \u00d7 6 = 42\n     - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n     - 3 units of Item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n     - 5 units of Item 5 = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n   - Total = 9 + 42 + 5 + 30 + 50 = 136\n\n  This allocation provides me a value higher than my outside offer and holds potential for agreement while being mindful of the counterparty's incentives.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Walking away would secure me a better value than accepting the current offer. However, I should attempt a counteroffer that maintains my value above 115.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that leaves Player 2 with items I value less and maintains a value above my fallback:\n\nCounteroffer: Propose giving Player 2 more Item 1 and some Item 2 while I keep significant value items 4 and 5.\nProposal to Player 2: [4, 7, 0, 0, 2]\n\nValue Calculation for keeping these:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- Total value = 3 + 18 + 5 + 30 + 40 = 96\n\nThe proposed counteroffer's value to me is less than 115, thus seems infeasible to be beneficial. To ensure value above my fallback:\n\nI will attempt,\nProposal to Player 2: [3, 5, 0, 0, 2]\n\nValue Calculation for keeping these:\n- 2 unit of item 1: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- Total value = 6 + 30 + 5 + 30 + 40 = 111\n\nStill insufficient with valid alternates.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the action to take, let's analyze the situation based on the questions provided:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 64\n   - Values of items to me:\n     - Item 1: 1 per unit\n     - Item 2: 10 per unit\n     - Item 3: 1 per unit\n     - Item 4: 5 per unit\n     - Item 5: 2 per unit\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: The discount factor of 0.9 applies to future rounds, which means the value of accepting an offer in later rounds will be impacted by a decrease in value. This encourages settling earlier if possible, but only when the value offered is advantageous.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There's no current offer to accept.\n   - My goal is to create a counteroffer that gives me a value over my outside offer, considering the discount factor if it goes to further rounds.\n   - Evaluate potential counteroffer: I need to determine an allocation where my resulting value exceeds 64 (my outside offer).\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nTo not make any mistakes from the list provided above, especially mistake 2 (offering worse value than my outside offer), I would create an initial counteroffer where I maintain a high value.\n\nThe total value from all the items if I keep everything:\n- `4 * 1 (item1) + 5 * 10 (item2) + 3 * 1 (item3) + 1 * 5 (item4) + 2 * 2 (item5) = 8 + 50 + 3 + 5 + 4 = 70`.\n\nWe need to ensure that the remaining items for me provide a value at least higher than 64 when proposing an offer. \n\nLet's make an offer with a high potential personal value. For example, if I offer 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 3, and 1 unit of item 5, this might work as a reasonable starting compromise:\n\n- Value of what I keep:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 1 = 2\n  - 5 units of item 2: 5 * 10 = 50\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 1 = 1\n  - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 5 = 5\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 2 = 2\n  - Total value = 2 + 50 + 1 + 5 + 2 = 60\n\nThis initial offer gives me 60 value if accepted now, which remains under the 64 fallback value but is helpful as a round 1 starting point in our negotiation, allowing for some room for concession in future rounds, given the discount rate.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 0, 1]}",

Accepting this offer would be a mistake, as it gives me a much lower value than what I can guarantee myself by walking away.\n\n   I should make a counteroffer that attempts to maximize my total value gained.\n\n   **My Proposed Counteroffer:**\n   - I should aim to retain most units of high-value items like item 2 (value 10) and protect against making a mistake 2 or 4. A possible strategy might be to keep all units of item 2.\n   - I could offer fewer units of less valuable items, while ensuring a fair distribution of other items.\n\n   So, I will counteroffer:\n   - Give Player 2: [2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\n   Let's calculate the value I'd retain:\n   - I'll keep 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - My total value would be:\n     - 2 * 1 (item 1) + 3 * 10 (item 2) + 2 * 1 (item 3) + 1 * 5 (item 4) + 1 * 2 (item 5)\n     - = 2 + 30 + 2 + 5 + 2 = 41\n\n   While this value is still below my outside offer, it shows an intention to negotiate. However, I must reconsider since this is too low compared to my outside offer. I would instead aim for better division. Therefore, the best decision is to walk away because my calculated counteroffer doesn't surpass the value of 64.\n\n   If required to give a realistic counteroffer, analyzing this:\n\n   Ensuring a realistic chance of Player 2 accepting, or else walking remains the best choice. As I cannot find a higher immediate payoff and to not make negotiation mistakes by missing out on my 64 fallback.\n\n4) **Final Decision:**\n   Considering the calculations and inability to make a compelling, realistic counteroffer above the outside offer, the decision is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 15. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 111 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 69. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 63 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

So, my final valuation would be multiplied by this factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n     - For me, this is 2 units of item 2, valued at \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\).\n     - Adjusted for the discount factor: \\(18 \\times 0.81 = 14.58\\).\n     - This value is less than my outside offer of 15, so I should not accept it, avoiding Mistake 4.\n  \n   - **Potential counteroffer:** I need a strategy to maximize my outcome while ensuring it beats my outside offer value.\n     - Let's consider keeping more items for myself:\n     - Suppose I offer Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 2, 0] (Player 2 would get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 0 of item 5)\n     - My share would be:\n       - Item 1: 5 units = \\(5 \\times 7 = 35\\)\n       - Item 2: 2 units = \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\)\n       - Item 3: 3 units = \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n       - Item 4: 3 units = \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n       - Total value = \\(35 + 18 + 24 + 9 = 86\\)\n       - Adjusted for the discount factor: \\(86 \\times 0.81 = 69.66\\)\n       - This is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer is less valuable than my outside offer, so I cannot ACCEPT.\n   - Walking away would guarantee my outside offer of 15, but a better offer can be made.\n   - Propose a COUNTEROFFER of [0, 1, 0, 2, 0] to potentially maximize my adjusted value while surpassing 15.\n\nThus, my decision, after weighing the options, is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "My reasoning:\n\n1. My outside offer is 77. My own private item values are: 10 for item 1, 2 for item 2, 4 for item 3, 1 for item 4, and 2 for item 5. The total pool is [7, 5, 4, 1, 5] for items 1\u20135.\n\n2. Player 1\u2019s current offer is [4, 1, 2, 0, 1]. If I accept that, I\u2019d receive:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 52.\nSince 52 < 77, accepting is worse than my fallback value.\n\n3. If I make a counteroffer, I propose a division by offering Player 1 some items and keeping the leftovers. My kept value (non-discounted) is computed as:\n\u2003\u2003107 \u2013 (10\u00d7x\u2081 + 2\u00d7x\u2082 + 4\u00d7x\u2083 + 1\u00d7x\u2084 + 2\u00d7x\u2085),\nwhere [x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083, x\u2084, x\u2085] is the quantity offered to Player 1.\nBecause a counteroffer made now will be concluded in round 2, its outcome is discounted by 0.9. I need:\n\u2003\u20030.9 \u00d7 (107 \u2013 sacrifice) \u2265 77\u2003\u2003\u21d2\u2003\u2003107 \u2013 sacrifice \u2265 77/0.9 \u2248 85.56.\nThis means the sacrifice (10\u00d7x\u2081 + 2\u00d7x\u2082 + 4\u00d7x\u2083 + x\u2084 + 2\u00d7x\u2085) must be no more than about 21.44 (or 21 in whole numbers).\n\n4. A simple counteroffer is to give 2 units of item 1 and nothing of the others. That sacrifice is 2\u00d710 = 20, which means I keep:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 7 \u2013 2 = 5 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 5 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4 units  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 1 unit  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 5 units,\nfor a value of 5\u00d710 + 5\u00d72 + 4\u00d74 + 1\u00d71 + 5\u00d72 = 50 + 10 + 16 + 1 + 10 = 87.\nAfter discount in round 2, my outcome will be 0.9 \u00d7 87 = 78.3, which is above my outside offer value of 77.\n\n5. This counteroffer is also an improvement for me over the current offer (52 value) and avoids giving away too high a share (so my kept value remains above the fallback after discount). It also avoids the pitfalls of making an offer worse than my fallback.\n\nThus, my action is to make the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Keeping all items (offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) would maximize my value but may not be acceptable to Player 2.\n     2. Offering items strategically to maximize my value while making an offer to Player 2 that they might accept.\n\n   Example counteroffer where I keep a significant portion but still offer something reasonable:\n   - Offer: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2.\n   - Remaining for me:\n     - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n     - Total value = 83\n    \n   However, this total (83) is less than my outside offer (93), making it not a viable choice.\n\n   Let's improve on this:\n   - Offer: 1 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n   - Remaining for me:\n     - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 10 = 60\n     - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n     - Total value = 109\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I should propose the second offer where I maximize my value to 109, which is better than my outside offer value of 93. This also provides Player 2 a reasonable distribution of goods that might appeal to their own preferences.\n\nHere is the action based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 93. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's reassess:\n\n     - Offer [5, 2, 0, 2, 0] to Player 2:\n       - Item 1: 7 - 5 = 2 (value = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20)\n       - Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3 (value = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18)\n       - Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 (value = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2)\n       - Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 (value = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2)\n       - Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3 (value = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15)\n       - Total value = 20 + 18 + 2 + 2 + 15 = 57, still less.\n\n   Given the calculation complexity and available units, attempt one more:\n\n     - Perhaps making a final strategic attempt to ensure outcome greater than 93:\n\n       **Offer [6, 3, 1, 2, 1]** to Player 2 where:\n       - Item 1: 7 - 6 = 1 (value = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10)\n       - Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2 (value = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12)\n       - Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 (value = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1)\n       - Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 (value = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2)\n       - Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 (value = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10)\n       - Total value = 10 + 12 + 1 + 2 + 10 = 35; still below threshold, reassess slightly.\n\n4) Deciding next, best strategy given higher possible values, **WALK** away to secure a value of 93.\n   \nSo:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 11. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 96 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's consider an offer where I maximize my value while providing a reasonable distribution to make the offer enticing enough for Player 2 to potentially accept:\n\n   Let's propose keeping a substantial number of items highly valuable to me and offering enough to Player 2 that they might find appealing:\n   - I will propose offering Player 2:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   \n   **Calculate the value for me of keeping the remaining items:**\n\n   - Remaining for me:\n     - Item 1: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n     - Item 2: 6 units = 6 \u00d7 9 = 54\n     - Item 3: 0 units = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - Item 4: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n     - Item 5: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n\n   Total value = 18 + 54 + 0 + 30 + 18 = 120\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n\n   Given my outside offer value is 156, this initial proposed offer's value to me (120) is less than this outside offer value. Thus, I am offering less than my outside offer value at the moment in trade for possibly concluding the negotiation early. This is a strategic offer because:\n   \n   - It's an initial offer, and starting lower allows room for negotiation.\n   - I'm retaining some units of each item while offering a non-zero and meaningful share.\n   \n   Therefore, I will proceed with my counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

The value remains the same in this round.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer (if any):** There is no current offer as negotiations are just starting.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** \n     - My goal is to propose an offer such that my retained total is equal to or greater than my outside offer value of 27.\n\n     Let's consider a balanced allowable starting offer and calculate its value:\n     - Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n     - My retention: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\n     Calculation of my retained value:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n     - **Total Retained Value:** 5 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 10 = 25\n\n     This retained value of 25 is less than my outside offer, so I need to keep more. Let's adjust the offer to increase my value:\n\n     Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n     - My retention: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n     \n     New Calculation of My Retained Value:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n     - **Total Retained Value:** 5 + 9 + 4 + 0 + 10 = 28\n\n     This retained value of 28 is sufficient and slightly above my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - The revised offer ensures my retained total value is greater than 27, which is above my outside offer value.\n   - By proposing this counteroffer, I maintain a beneficial negotiation position without immediately resorting to walking away.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 20. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 84 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 134. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 108 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my best action, I need to go through the analysis step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n1. **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 134.\n\n2. **Values of items (per unit):**\n   - Item 1: 8\n   - Item 2: 10\n   - Item 3: 6\n   - Item 4: 8\n   - Item 5: 4\n\n3. **Total pool of items:**\n   - Item 1: 4 units\n   - Item 2: 3 units\n   - Item 3: 1 unit\n   - Item 4: 10 units\n   - Item 5: 6 units\n\n4. **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. At round 2, the value of any agreement we reach is multiplied by 0.9 to the power of (2-1) = 0.9.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n1. **Current offer ([0, 1, 0, 0, 0]):** This translates to me receiving 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n   - Total value if I accept = (0 * 8) + (1 * 10) + (0 * 6) + (0 * 8) + (0 * 4) = 10\n   - Since this is in round 2, it's adjusted by the discount factor: \\(10 \\times 0.9 = 9\\).\n\n2. **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate potential counteroffers that would give me a value greater than or equal to my outside offer value of 134 after the discount factor is applied (119.4 in round 2).\n\nFor example:\n- Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (I keep everything):\n  - Value to me = (4 * 8) + (3 * 10) + (1 * 6) + (10 * 8) + (6 * 4) = 172\n  - Adjusted value in round 2 = 172 * 0.9 = 154.8 (greater than 119.4)\n\nTherefore, my counteroffer must yield an adjusted value greater than 119.4 for it to be advantageous over my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\n1. **Evaluate current offer:** The current offer gives me an adjusted value of 9, which is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 134 even after adjusting for the discount factor.\n\n2. **Should I accept the current offer?** No, since 9 is less than my outside offer of 134.\n\n3. **Should I walk away?** Not yet, since I have the opportunity to propose a counteroffer that could yield me a value greater than 134.\n\n4. **Propose a counteroffer that gives me a higher value:** \n\nI suggest offering Player 2 [2, 0, 0, 7, 5].\n- This means I keep 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n- Value to me = (2 * 8) + (3 * 10) + (1 * 6) + (3 * 8) + (1 * 4) = 16 + 30 + 6 + 24 + 4 = 80\n- Adjusted value in round 2 = 80 * 0.9 = 72\n\nSince 72 is still less than 119.4, I need to offer something that brings my value enough above to meet or exceed the criteria.\n\nTo find a balanced offer, I could try offering something intermediate, ensuring both an improved stance over previous negotiable values and an effective negotiation material:\n\nPossible balanced counteroffer: [1, 0, 0, 5, 3]. I keep 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 3 of item 5).\n- Value to me = (3 * 8) + (3 * 10) + (1 * 6) + (5 * 8) + (3 * 4) = 24 + 30 + 6 + 40 + 12 = 112\n- Adjusted value in round 2 = 112 * 0.9 = 100.8\n\nThis is still not enough. Therefore, I should propose an offer where I keep more, leading to a value close or greater than needed for this round's criteria adjustment. Hence:\n\nFinal offer: [0, 0, 0, 3, 4].\n\n- I keep 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 7 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\n- Value to me = (4 * 8) + (3 * 10) + (1 * 6) + (7 * 8) + (2 * 4) = 32 + 30 + 6 + 56 + 8 = 132\n- Adjusted value = 132 * 0.9 = 118.8\n\nIt's quite close, so with sligt adjustment:\nLet me propose: I'm going to tentatively work to balance round benefits:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 6, 4]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 54. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 72 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

I need to make an offer where the value I retain is higher than my outside offer of $100.\n\nTo achieve a value greater than $100, I'll consider keeping most valuable items and offer others some units:\n\n**Let's consider offering the following:**\n- Offer Player 2, [2, 0, 2, 3, 6]\n\nIf I keep: [2, 4, 4, 3, 0]\n- Value for me = (2 units of item 1 * 5) + (4 units of item 2 * 10) + (4 units of item 3 * 5) + (3 units of item 4 * 3) + (0 units of item 5 * 3)\n- Value for me = (10) + (40) + (20) + (9) + (0) = $79\n\nThis allocation obviously values to less than my outside offer; hence, I must adjust.\n\n**Let's consider another offer:**\n- Offer Player 2, [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nIf I keep: [3, 3, 5, 5, 5]\n- Value for me = (3 units of item 1 * 5) + (3 units of item 2 * 10) + (5 units of item 3 * 5) + (5 units of item 4 * 3) + (5 units of item 5 * 3)\n- Value for me = (15) + (30) + (25) + (15) + (15) = $100\n\nThis provides value exactly equal to my outside offer, which is not optimal given that it can be perceived as a strong first stance.\n\nFinally, propose:\n\n**Optimal offer:**\nOffer Player 2, [1, 1, 1, 2, 6]\n\nIf I keep: [3, 3, 5, 4, 0]\n- Value for me = (3 * 5) + (3 * 10) + (5 * 5) + (4 * 3) + (0 * 3) \n- Value for me = 15 + 30 + 25 + 12 + 0 = $82\n\nStill, offering less than outside, proceed:\n\n### Proposed action:\nRiassess strategies of possible errors identified:\nCountergesture enhancements where possible to hit better value from gamma.\n\nRetain strongest value proportions to offset discount functional elements from Player 2 upcoming rounds.\nMove within expanded strike zones.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 2, 6]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 21. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 96 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Thus, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I should not accept the current offer because it is worse than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away is an option but not optimal in round 2, as I might propose a counteroffer that's better than my outside offer.\n   - Propose a counteroffer that ensures I retain enough value, considering the discount in the next round.\n\nConsidering a counteroffer:\n- Let's propose I receive:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 28\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 18\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 6\n  - 4 units of item 5 = 28\n  - Total value = 28 + 0 + 18 + 6 + 28 = 80\n\nThis proposed value of 80 is close to my outside offer but not infringing Mistake 2 as it's slightly lower than 81 due to the discount factor considering it might get accepted in round 3.\n\nThe counteroffer to Player 2 would be [1, 5, 0, 3, 2], which I previously evaluated as having a very low value (35) for me, making it unrealistic for them to accept without changes.

In this game \u201coffer\u201d means exactly that. However, the negotiation history shows that when I made my round1 counteroffer ([1,5,0,3,2]), it meant I was offering those units to Player 1 and keeping the remainder.\n\u2003\u2003Actually, Player1\u2019s current offer ([1,0,0,3,2]) means they would give me exactly that many units.

In round2 the deal\u2019s raw value V is discounted by 0.9 so to beat 43 I need V > 43/0.9 \u2248 47.8. Also, a key rule (\u201cMistake 1\u201d) prevents me from proposing a counteroffer that is worse than my previous offer. My round1 counteroffer ([1,5,0,3,2]) would have given me the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003My share = Total \u2013 [1,5,0,3,2] = [5\u20131, 5\u20135, 3\u20130, 5\u20133, 6\u20132] = [4,0,3,2,4]\n\u2003\u2003My raw value then:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 1: 4\u00d78 = 32\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 2: 0\u00d71 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 3: 3\u00d76 = 18\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 2\u00d73 = 6\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 5: 4\u00d78 = 32\n\u2003\u2003Total = 32+0+18+6+32 = 88 raw value.\n\u2003\u2003Discounted (0.9 factor) that equals 79.2, well above my fallback.\n\n3) Since accepting the current offer yields only 33 raw (or 29.7 after discount) which is worse than the outside offer, and I must not propose a counteroffer that gives me less than 88 raw value (my previous offer), the best move is to reassert my earlier offer. This counteroffer [1,5,0,3,2] gives me my previous 88 raw value share and is not worse than any offer I\u2019ve made earlier.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 0, 3, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 81. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 72 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 0, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 5, 0, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 5, 0, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 0, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 81.\n   - My values for the items are: \n     - Item 1: 7\n     - Item 2: 1\n     - Item 3: 6\n     - Item 4: 3\n     - Item 5: 7\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - Item 1: 5 units\n     - Item 2: 5 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 6 units\n   - The current offer from Player 2: [1, 5, 0, 3, 2]\n   - The discount factor (gamma) = 0.9. Since it's round 3, the overall value of the negotiation outcome will be reduced by the discount factor (no power since it's the final round for me).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Value of the Current Offer:**\n     - I receive: [1, 0, 3, 2, 4] (since there are 5 items, these are what's left after Player 2's offer)\n     - Total value if I accept:\n       - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n       - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0 \n       - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 \n       - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n       - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n     - Total = 7 + 0 + 18 + 6 + 28 = 59\n   - Since my outside offer is 81, this offer is worse than my outside option.\n   - **Considering Counteroffers:**\n     - Since it's the last round, any counteroffer will effectively be treated as a decision to walk, so it's only relevant to compare the current offer to my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Since the current offer from Player 2 (value 59) is worse than my outside offer (81), it is not beneficial to accept the current offer.\n   - As it is the last round, I must decide whether to accept or walk. Given the current offer is worse than my outside option of 81, the rational decision is to walk away.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate action is to choose the outside offer, as it guarantees a higher value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Sure, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 80\n   - Values of the items involved are: \n     - Item 1: 9 per unit\n     - Item 2: 10 per unit\n     - Item 3: 4 per unit\n     - Item 4: 9 per unit\n     - Item 5: 2 per unit\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: 0.9, influencing my evaluation by reducing future potential gains slightly with each additional round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] to me: \n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 2 (value per unit) = 2\n     - Total value if I accept: 2\n   - This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 80.\n   \n   - Potential counteroffers:\n     - My goal is to propose an offer where the total value to me is above 80 after considering the discount for the current round (0.9^1 = 0.9).\n     - A quick calculation of potential value for counteroffers:\n       Let's try keeping most high-value items:\n       - If I keep 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5:\n         - Value = (3 \u00d7 9) + (1 \u00d7 10) + (3 \u00d7 4) + (1 \u00d7 9) + (1 \u00d7 2) \n         - = 27 + 10 + 12 + 9 + 2 = 60  \n       - Adjust for discount: 60 \u00d7 0.9 = 54\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is not optimal, as the total value of 2 is much lower than my outside offer of 80.\n   - Walking away now also is not beneficial with the negotiation still ongoing.\n   - A counteroffer needs to offer a fair value. Player 2 valued the current offer at such low current terms (signalling very different valuation or strategy).\n\n   I will make a counteroffer to balance somewhat equally to make it worth both sides without surpassing their outside offer value too drastically, ensuring a basic acceptability.\n   \n   I propose the following counteroffer, doing a revised negotiation:\n   - Offer [1, 0, 2, 1, 1] to Player 2, meaning I keep [3, 2, 1, 0, 1]. \n\nCalculating my value:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 27\n- 2 units of item 2 = 20\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 4\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 2\nTotal = 53, considering the 0.9 factor = 53 \u00d7 0.9 = 47.7\n\nGiven the adjustment here and with negotiation aspects, it meets better than a paltry single unit of Item 5. Thus, counteroffering like this:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 1]}",

Given the current offer and my values, it's crucial to craft a proposal that maximizes my return without jeopardizing the acceptance by Player 2.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer ensuring my total value exceeds my fallback:\n\n**Counteroffer:** Instead of offering all of item 5 as previously, I could keep more valuable items.\n\nMy goal could be to control more of items with higher personal value (1 and 2) while still trying to maintain a fair division:\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n- If I keep for myself:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n  - Total value = 36 + 20 + 8 + 9 + 2 = 75\n\nEven though 75 is less than 80, we must attempt a balanced offer considering Player 2's priorities could shift the acceptance.\n\nThus, I risk either no deal or a counteroffer that strategically closes in on my value goals without negating my objectives. But given the context roles, making a further strategic attempt here aligns to a greater feasible counter from their end. Due to the majority conclusion threshold met, I consider:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 37. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 33 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's go step by step through the analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 37.\n   - My values per unit of each item type are:\n     - Item 1: 4\n     - Item 2: 2\n     - Item 3: 3\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 1\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, influences the value of future offers by reducing their value.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table, so I need to make one.\n   - I need to propose a division that makes my total value at least as high as my outside offer of 37, keeping mistakes 2-5 in mind.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer and calculate its value to me. Here's a potential distribution:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [2, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n  - This means I keep: [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n  - My total value:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n  - Total value = 8 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16\n\nThe calculated value of 16 is much lower than my outside offer value of 37. Therefore, I'll need to adjust this to get a better offer to maximize my potential gains while avoiding the listed mistakes.\n\nLet's try another counteroffer:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [1, 2, 2, 0, 1]\n  - This means I keep: [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n  - My total value:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n  - Total value = 12 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 24\n\nAgain, the value of 24 is still less than my outside offer of 37. Therefore, I will need to make a more favorable counteroffer or simply decide to walk away.\n\nConsidering my outside offer value is 37, and considering no other offer is likely viable to beat this value, my best course here is to walk away.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - None of my considered counteroffers reach the value of 37 or higher.\n   - To avoid Mistake 2, I must not offer something that yields a lower payoff than my fallback.\n   - Therefore, I should walk away.\n\nMy action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Current Situation Analysis:\n   - My outside offer value is 24.\n   - My values for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 10 per unit\n     - Item 2: 5 per unit\n     - Item 3: 5 per unit\n     - Item 4: 8 per unit\n     - Item 5: 1 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means the value of offers decreases by 10% each subsequent round. Therefore, maximizing value in earlier rounds is preferable.\n\n2. Assessment of the Value of Offers:\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2.\n   - I need to make an initial offer that maximizes my value while being reasonable enough for Player 2 to consider accepting or counteroffering.\n   - I should aim for a division that gives me more than my outside offer (24) after discount adjustment, considering also a potentially attractive proposal for Player 2.\n\n3. Decision Making:\n   - A strong possible initial offer would be to keep more of the higher-value items for myself while offering a reasonable share of lower-value items to Player 2.\n   - Let's propose a counteroffer that lightly leans towards maximizing my return without driving Player 2 to walk away. \n\n### Calculating the Offer:\n\nI can keep 3 units of item 1 (worth 30 to me), 2 units of item 2 (worth 10), 2 units of item 3 (worth 10), 2 units of item 4 (worth 16), and 0 units of item 5 (worth 0). This results in:\n\n- My total value = 30 + 10 + 10 + 16 + 0 = 66\n\nThis value far exceeds my outside offer of 24, even with the discount factor applied in future rounds.\n\nTherefore, I propose to offer Player 2:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nResulting in the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 4]}",

Calculating my value on that offer: \n \u2022 0 units of item 1 \u2192 0 \n \u2022 1 unit of item 2 \u2192 1\u00d77 = 7 \n \u2022 0 units of item 3 \u2192 0 \n \u2022 0 units of item 4 \u2192 0 \n \u2022 0 units of item 5 \u2192 0 \nTotal = 7, which is nowhere near 81.\n\nSince I must get at least 81 in value (and this round has no discount penalty because gamma^(0)=1) it makes sense to propose a counteroffer. I can propose a division of the items by defining the offer as the set of items I would give to Player 1; I then keep whatever remains, which becomes my bundle.\n\nTo guarantee my value is at least 81, note that if I keep items with a total value of at least 81, then the \u201closs\u201d in value to me cannot exceed 93-81=12. I want to give away items that have low value to me. Item 4 is the lowest (worth only 1 per unit) and there are 3 units available. Giving over all of item 4 will cost me only 3 points in value, leaving me with the rest:\n \u2022 My bundle would then be: item 1: 3, item 2: 5, item 3: 1, item 4: 0, item 5: 2.\nMy total value becomes: 3\u00d710 + 5\u00d77 + 1\u00d77 + 0\u00d71 + 2\u00d79 = 30 + 35 + 7 + 0 + 18 = 90, which exceeds my outside offer of 81.\n\nThus, in round 1 I will propose a counteroffer giving Player 1 all 3 units of item 4 (and keeping all the other items) with the offer:\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 0].\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 77. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 77. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 72 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I will perform the necessary calculations and assessments step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 77\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 3 units, valued at 5 per unit\n  - Item 2: 4 units, valued at 9 per unit\n  - Item 3: 4 units, valued at 6 per unit\n  - Item 4: 5 units, valued at 2 per unit\n  - Item 5: 1 unit, valued at 2 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** \n  - The discount factor is 0.9. In round 1, this has no direct impact as any deals concluded in this round do not suffer discounting.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **There is no current offer on the table.**\n\n- **Value Calculation for Hypothetical Offers:**\n  - To ensure I make a counteroffer better than my outside offer and avoid proposing an offer worse than my outside offer, I need to calculate the total value I would retain for different distributions.\n\n  Consider a potential division that would maximize my value. For instance:\n  - If I keep all items for myself, my value would be:\n    - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n    - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n    - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n    - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n    - **Total = 87**\n\n  To make a meaningful counteroffer, I can consider a distribution such as giving up all the less valuable items first:\n\n  Proposed Offer:\n  - Give Player 2 the least valuable item 4 and item 5 (I keep more valuable items):\n    - I give: [0 (item 1), 0 (item 2), 0 (item 3), 5 (item 4), 1 (item 5)]\n    - I retain: \n      - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n      - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n      - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n    - **Total value retained = 75**\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nMy proposed offer results in a value of 75, which is less than my outside offer of 77. Additionally, giving up all of items 4 and 5 leaves me with high valued items but doesn't meet the outside offer. It seems best to make the initial offer but retain most of the valuable units to start negotiations.\n\nThe strategic first offer should slightly undervalue my outside offer to potentially improve with negotiation:\n\n- Let's adjust slightly to balance close to my outside offer:\n\nImproved Offer:\n- Give Player 2 something more on item 3 and adjust for balance while keeping as much in value as possible:\n  - I give: [0 (item 1), 0 (item 2), 2 (item 3), 4 (item 4), 0 (item 5)]\n  - I retain:\n    - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n    - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n    - Total = 63\n\nReplay again for values with adjustment with more realistic counteroffers along this margin and adjust for accepting more value from item 2 and included units while refining this. \n\nUnder the constraint that offering doesn't undermine outside value: Offer focus narrowly to reach as possible.\n\nTherefore, the counteroffer:\n\n- **Counteroffer to give:** [0, 2, 0, 4, 1]\n\nRetained value:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n- Item 3: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n- Retain = 59 for items given = 73 newly retained based on adjustments across possible markets\n\nTotal offer narrowly close surpass side hitting on each offered as retained.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 4, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

That is, if I get V (undiscounted), then 0.9\u00d7V must exceed 82. Solving 0.9\u00d7V > 82 gives V > 91.1. Since the maximum total value I could get by taking everything is 111, I can afford to give away some items provided I keep at least about 92 in undiscounted value.\n\nI want to avoid the mistakes of offering too little to the opponent or offering a package that leaves me with less than my outside alternative. A very \u201cgreedy\u201d offer (giving nothing) is also undesirable (Mistake 3). Looking at my valuation, item 4 has the lowest per\u2010unit value (4), so offering a small quantity of that to Player 1 is a low \u201ccost\u201d concession. I can also consider a small concession on item 1 (value 5/unit) to provide a bit more incentive.\n\nFor instance, if I propose offering Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] units (i.e. 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 4), then my allocation becomes:\n\u2022 Item 1: 7 \u2013 1 = 6 units \u2192 6\u00d75 = 30\n\u2022 Item 2: 4 \u2013 0 = 4 units \u2192 4\u00d76 = 24\n\u2022 Item 3: 4 \u2013 0 = 4 units \u2192 4\u00d75 = 20\n\u2022 Item 4: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units \u2192 3\u00d74 = 12\n\u2022 Item 5: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units \u2192 2\u00d78 = 16\nTotal value for me: 30 + 24 + 20 + 12 + 16 = 102 (undiscounted), and if this deal is reached in the next round the effective value will be 0.9\u00d7102 = 91.8, which exceeds my fallback of 82.\n\nThis counteroffer avoids giving away too much (keeping me above my fallback threshold) while offering the other player something (so I don\u2019t make the error of offering nothing early on). \n\nThus, my response is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 35. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 45 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 59. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 59. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 69 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 36. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 84 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

To avoid mistake #2, I cannot propose any division that yields less than 97. \n\n   Let's consider a counteroffer where my value exceeds 97 after the 0.9 discount:\n   - Ideal outcome for me: \n     - Item 1: 3 units = 30\n     - Item 2: 1 unit = 8 \n     - Item 3: 0 units = 0 \n     - Item 4: 3 units = 12\n     - Item 5: 2 units = 14\n     - Total value = 30 + 8 + 12 + 14 = 64\n     - Adjusted for round 2 = 64 \u00d7 0.9 = 57.6\n\n   This doesn't exceed my outside offer of 97 even with an idealistic allocation. Therefore, I should counter with a more feasible distribution:\n   - Offer: [2, 1, 0, 3, 1] (as initially offered), ensuring I keep:\n     - Item 1: 3 units = 30\n     - Item 2: 1 unit = 8\n     - Item 3: 1 unit = 8\n     - Item 4: 2 units = 8\n     - Item 5: 2 units = 14\n     - Total value = 30 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 14 = 68\n     - Adjusted for round 2 = 68 \u00d7 0.9 = 61.2, still below 97\n\nConsidering the above, any realistic distribution with the current limited units and round penalty leads to values below 97.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 86. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 86. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To make a decision, I need to analyze the situation.\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 86.\n   - My values for the items are: \n     - Item 1: 4\n     - Item 2: 9\n     - Item 3: 9\n     - Item 4: 5\n     - Item 5: 6\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor of 0.9 reduces future offers' value by a factor of 0.9 per round from the second round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer to accept.\n   - To decide on a potential counteroffer, I'll calculate my value for various divisions.\n\nLet's consider a few example divisions:\n- Example Offer 1: [1, 2, 0, 2, 1] to Player 2, leaving me with [2, 2, 0, 3, 2].\n  - My value for this offer:\n    - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n    - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 9 = 0\n    - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 5 = 15\n    - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 6 = 12\n    - Total value = 53\n\n- Example Offer 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], where I take everything. This yields my maximum value of:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n  - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n  - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 5 = 25\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n  - Total value = 91\n\nNeither of the above examples reaches my outside offer of 86. However, Example Offer 2 is unrealistic to give to opponent, and Example Offer 1 is too low. \n\nTherefore, let's construct a divided offer that potentially maximizes my value while being reasonable for Player 2 to consider:\n\n- Proposed Offer: [1, 3, 0, 2, 1] to Player 2, leaving me with [2, 1, 0, 3, 2].\n  - My value for this offer:\n    - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n    - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n    - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 9 = 0\n    - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 5 = 15\n    - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 6 = 12\n    - Total value = 44\n\nGiven the high outside offer of 86, even this offer falls short, suggesting I need a more favorable configuration.\n\nRevise the proposed offer:\n- Proposed Offer: [0, 2, 0, 2, 1] to Player 2, leaving me with [3, 2, 0, 3, 2].\n  - My value for this offer:\n    - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 4 = 12\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 9 = 18\n    - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 9 = 0\n    - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 5 = 15\n    - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 6 = 12\n    - Total value = 57\n\nAgain, the total does not exceed the outside offer of 86.\n\nGiven the constraints, my best action in round 1 is to propose an offer near my outside value while being realistic.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I will propose a balanced offer in hopes that it is sufficiently appealing to Player 2 while maximizing my returns.\n\nMy action:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]}\n```\n\nThis leaves me with 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5 for a total value of 84, just under the outside offer but better aligned geographically for concessions.",

Therefore, this specific division is not acceptable.\n\n   I will adjust the proposal slightly to ensure my value exceeds 168:\n\n   New proposal:\n   - Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 4 units)\n   - Item 2: 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 2 units)\n   - Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 4 units)\n   - Item 4: 5 units to Player 2 (I keep 1 unit)\n   - Item 5: 3 units to Player 2 (I keep 7 units)\n\n   Recalculate the value:\n   - 4 units of Item 1: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n   - 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n   - 4 units of Item 3: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n   - 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n   - 7 units of Item 5: 7 \u00d7 9 = 63\n\n   New total value: 32 + 12 + 36 + 2 + 63 = **145**\n\n   The calculated value is still below 168. Another adjustment is needed. Let's revise again:\n   \n   Refined proposal:\n   - Item 1: 0 units to Player 2 (I keep 5 units)\n   - Item 2: 3 units to Player 2 (I keep 1 unit)\n   - Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2 (I keep 4 units)\n   - Item 4: 5 units to Player 2 (I keep 1 unit)\n   - Item 5: 4 units to Player 2 (I keep 6 units)\n\n   Recalculate the value:\n   - 5 units of Item 1: 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n   - 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n   - 4 units of Item 3: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n   - 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n   - 6 units of Item 5: 6 \u00d7 9 = 54\n\n   New total value: 40 + 6 + 36 + 2 + 54 = **138**\n\n   Yet again, failing to meet my outside offer. Let's try another offer:\n\n   Proposal:\n   - Item 1: 0 units to Player 2 (I keep 5 units)\n   - Item 2: 2 units to Player 2 (I keep 2 units)\n   - Item 3: 0 units to Player 2 (I keep 5 units)\n   - Item 4: 6 units to Player 2 (I keep 0 units)\n   - Item 5: 4 units to Player 2 (I keep 6 units)\n\n   Recalculate the value:\n   - 5 units of Item 1: 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n   - 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n   - 5 units of Item 3: 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n   - 0 unit of Item 4: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   - 6 units of Item 5: 6 \u00d7 9 = 54\n\n   New total value: 40 + 12 + 45 + 0 + 54 = **151**\n\n   Similarly, this too does not work. Let's try a different balance:\n\n   A different counteroffer could be:\n   - Item 1: 0 units to Player 2 (I keep 5 units)\n   - Item 2: 3 units to Player 2 (I keep 1 unit)\n   - Item 3: 1 units to Player 2 (I keep 4 units)\n   - Item 4: 6 units to Player 2 (I keep 0 units)\n   - Item 5: 3 units to Player 2 (I keep 7 units)\n\n   Recalculate the value:\n   - 5 units of Item 1: 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n   - 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n   - 4 units of Item 3: 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n   - 0 unit of Item 4: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   - 7 units of Item 5: 7 \u00d7 9 = 63\n\n   New total value: 40 + 6 + 36 + 0 + 63 = **145**\n\n   Adjusting player 2 more on item 3 and 5 as they possibly have the lowest value:\n   - Item 1: 0 units to Player 2 (I keep 5 units)\n   - Item 2: 4 units to Player 2 (I keep 0 units)\n   - Item 3: 0 units to Player 2 (I keep 5 units)\n   - Item 4: 6 units to Player 2 (I keep 0 units)\n   - Item 5: 0 units to Player 2 (I keep 10 units)\n\n   Recalculate the value:\n   - 5 units of Item 1: 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n   - 0 units of Item 2: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n   - 5 units of Item 3: 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n   - 0 units of Item 4: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   - 10 units of Item 5: 10 \u00d7 9 = 90\n\n   New total value: 40 + 0 + 45 + 0 + 90 = **175**\n\n   Finally, a division where the value to me, 175, exceeds my outside offer of 168.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n\n   I want to propose an offer that offers Player 2 the greatest claim to the lower-valued items (on which they must have higher valuations). Hence, a proposal that maximizes my payoff without risking the outcome to be lower than the outside offer, in this round:\n\n   - My final counteroffer (keeping proposal) gives:\n     - Item 1: 0 for Player 2\n     - Item 2: 4 for Player 2\n     - Item 3: 0 for Player 2\n     - Item 4: 6 for Player 2\n     - Item 5: 0 for Player 2\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 6, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My outside offer is high (93), so I need the value of any offer to be very close to this in early rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Currently, there is no offer on the table to assess.\n   - To get a value close to or above 93, I need to consider the total potential value of the offers I make.\n\n3) Decision making:\n   - I must make an initial offer. To maximize my value, I\u2019ll propose an offer that aims to keep high-value items for myself while still giving Player 2 an appealing division:\n\nGiven my valuations, keeping more of item 2 and item 5 \u2014 which have the highest values for me \u2014 is important. Let\u2019s propose offering a significant portion of the lower-value items (for me) to Player 2, ensuring the total value for me remains high.\n\nLet's calculate a strategic counteroffer:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 3 units of item 1 (value to me = 0)\n  - 4 units of item 2 (value to me = 0)\n  - 1 unit of item 3 (value to me = 2 x 4 = 8)\n  - 1 unit of item 4 (value to me = 1 x 1 = 1)\n  - 2 units of item 5 (value to me = 3 x 10 = 30)\n\nFor me (keeping):\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n\nMy total value with this division = 8 + 1 + 30 = 39.\n\nGiven the total is far below my outside offer (93), I need to reconsider. A better offer to meet or exceed my 93 value could be something more favorable to myself:\n\nRevised Proposal:\n- Offer Player 2 only lower-value items:\n  - 0 unit of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 0 unit of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\nSince giving any units results in less than my outside offer, the best option currently is to WALK, as there isn't an indication of any beneficial offer that exceeds my guaranteed fallback of 93.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 24. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 96 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 3, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 2, any offer would currently be reduced by this discount factor raised to the power of (r-1) which equals 0.9 for this round.\n\n2) **Value Assessment of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** The current offer gives me [0, 3, 1, 2, 1].\n     - Value = (0 * 8) + (3 * 7) + (1 * 1) + (2 * 6) + (1 * 10)\n     - Value = 0 + 21 + 1 + 12 + 10 = 44 \n     - Adjusted value with discount factor = 44 * 0.9 = 39.6\n       - This value (39.6) is higher than my outside offer (24), so accepting could be beneficial unless a better counteroffer can be made.\n   - **Previous Offers:**\n     - My offer in round 1: [0, 4, 3, 3, 1], which was not accepted by Player 2.\n     - Player 2's previous offer was also [0, 3, 1, 2, 1].\n\n3) **Decision Based on Analysis:**\n\n  To maximize my value, I should consider proposing a counteroffer keeping a greater total value than the outside offer while ensuring it's acceptable to Player 2:\n\n   - **Counteroffer Calculation:**\n     Let's try to propose a counteroffer that keeps high-value items with a bit more from alternatives:\n     - Proposal: [0, 5, 2, 2, 1]\n       - My keeping: [2, 4, 2, 2, 2]\n       - My value = (2 * 8) + (4 * 7) + (2 * 1) + (2 * 6) + (2 * 10) \n       - My value = 16 + 28 + 2 + 12 + 20 = 78\n       - Adjusted value = 78 * 0.9 = 70.2\n       - This is considerably above my outside offer value and aims to entice Player 2 with more item 2 and keeping compelling items.\n\nBased on the evaluation, the counteroffer allows me to maintain a very high value while offering Player 2 a considerable amount of something they initially requested:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

This means any value I compute for an offer should be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**  \n     Current offer: [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]  \n     - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n     - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n     - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0  \n     Total value = 26  \n     After applying the discount factor: \\(26 \\times 0.9 = 23.4\\)\n\n   - **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**  \n     I need to ensure any proposed counteroffer gives me a value greater than 24 (after applying the discount factor) to consider it.\n\n   - **How do these values compare to my outside offer value?**  \n     My outside offer value is 24. The current offer, after considering the discount, provides 23.4 which is less than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - **Should I accept the current offer?**  \n     No, since it's worth less than my outside offer.\n\n   - **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**  \n     Since the current offer is less valuable than my outside offer, this is a viable option.\n\n   - **Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?**  \n     Any counteroffer should provide a calculated value greater than 24 after the discount to justify not taking my outside offer.\n\nGiven that the current offer doesn't exceed my outside offer and it's the final round, proposing a counteroffer that meets the requirement might be complex without the negotiation rounds remaining.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 58. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 60 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, I'll follow the outlined steps and conduct a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is valued at 58.\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 2 per unit\n  - Item 2: 4 per unit\n  - Item 3: 1 per unit\n  - Item 4: 3 per unit\n  - Item 5: 10 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 1 unit\n  - Item 2: 5 units\n  - Item 3: 2 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 7 units\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) will reduce the value of the offer in future rounds, implying it might be beneficial to either secure a favorable deal early or ensure any future deal is substantially better to compensate for the discount.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer to accept, I will consider a counteroffer that maximizes my value compared to the outside offer.\n\n- **Analyzing Potential Counteroffers:**\n\n  To get a value equal to or higher than my outside offer (58), I should consider how many units I need:\n  \n  My total value from all items available is \\(1 \\times 2 + 5 \\times 4 + 2 \\times 1 + 3 \\times 3 + 7 \\times 10 = 103\\).\n\n  I should aim for allocations where my retained items' value is \u2265 58.\n\n  Calculation for potential distribution:\n  \n  1. If I offer 0 units of item 5: I receive all 7 units, valued at \\(7 \\times 10 = 70\\). This alone exceeds my outside offer and is beneficial to explore a fair distribution of other items.\n  \n  2. Distribute smaller value items reasonably:\n      * Offer fewer high-value units like item 5 or large numbers of low-value items.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThe initial counteroffer should aim to at least match my outside offer:\n\nBy proposing a more beneficial split for me while allowing the other player something reasonable, I aim to keep the majority of high-value items. A tentative offer might be:\n\n- Allow Player 2: 0 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n- This means I'll get 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\n\n**Value of my retained items:**\n- \\(1 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 4 + 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 3 + 6 \\times 10 = 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 60 = 70.\\)\n\nThis ensures I achieve a value greater than my outside offer and does not make any mistake outlined.\n\n### Action\n\nConsidering maximizing my value and ensuring my outcome is significantly better than my outside offer, I propose the following:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Let's evaluate the situation step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 106.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 8\n     - Item 2: 2\n     - Item 3: 4\n     - Item 4: 5\n     - Item 5: 8\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 7 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means if we conclude in later rounds, my value is reduced by this factor.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Since there is no current offer from Player 2, I need to propose a counteroffer with my first move.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer where the total value to me is greater than 106 because if the value of what I keep is less than 106, I should rather take my outside offer or make a better counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider a potential division of items. Since my outside offer value is 106, I should try to keep items worth more than this value.\n\n- Let's consider keeping:\n  - 2 units of item 1, worth 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n  - 3 units of item 2, worth 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n  - 5 units of item 3, worth 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n  - 3 units of item 4, worth 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - 4 units of item 5, worth 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n\n  Total value if I keep these: 16 + 6 + 20 + 15 + 32 = 89\n\nThis current allocation doesn't exceed the value of 106. I'll have to keep more high-value items, particularly item 5 and item 1, to reach a value greater than 106.\n\nLet's adjust:\n\n- Keep all of item 1 worth 16\n- Keep 1 unit of item 2 worth 2\n- Keep 6 units of item 3 worth 24\n- Keep 2 units of item 4 worth 10\n- Keep 4 units of item 5 worth 32\n\nTotal Value now: 16 + 2 + 24 + 10 + 32 = 84\n\nWe're still below 106. Let's reconfigure optimally:\n\n- Keep all of item 1 worth 16\n- Keep all of item 4 worth 25\n- Keep all of item 5 worth 48\n- Remaining: 1 units of item 3 worth 4\n\nTotal value for Player 2: 37\n\nNew allocation to reach: Counteroffer - Keep maximum of high valued items for my side while giving lower valued items to them.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Should I accept the current offer? There is none.\n   - Should I walk away now? No, because I haven't yet proposed an offer.\n   - Propose a specific counteroffer to Player 2 after ensuring my kept total value is more than 106.\n\nCounteroffer:\n\nLet's offer Player 2 the least valuable items for me to optimize my retained value:\n\nOffering:\n- 0 units of Item 1\n- 3 units of Item 2\n- 1 unit of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 2 units of Item 5\n\nThis leaves enough high-value items for me, potentially making my total held value exceed 106.\n\nBased on that calculation, let\u2019s propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

This is the value I would receive if no agreement is reached.\n   - The values of the items to me are: \n     - Item 1: 6 per unit\n     - Item 2: 5 per unit\n     - Item 3: 6 per unit\n     - Item 4: 7 per unit\n     - Item 5: 7 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 8 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, meaning negotiation value is halved in each subsequent round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer to assess.\n   - I need to determine my total value for several proposed divisions. For any counteroffers I propose, I will compare the value of what I keep to my outside offer value of 104.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I should aim for a counteroffer that maximizes my value above 104.\n\nLet's devise a potential counteroffer. Consider attempting to secure items that maximize my total value above my fallback option:\n\n- Assume a distribution where I secure maximum high-value items:\n  - If I take all of item 4 and item 5, my value is:\n    - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 7 = 28\n    - 8 units of item 5: 8 * 7 = 56\n    - Total value = 84, which is less than my outside option. So I need to adjust.\n\nLet's try a more balanced approach keeping:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 6 = 12\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 * 5 = 10\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 6 = 18\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 7 = 14\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 * 7 = 28\n\nTotal value = 82. This is still below 104, thus needs adjusting. \n\nLet's maximize item 4 and 5 to see my benefit again:\n- 3 units of item 4: 21\n- 7 units of item 5: 49\n- 2 units of item 1: 12\n- 2 units of item 2: 10\n- 2 units of item 3: 12\n\nTotal value = 104, still needs improvement to account for the round 2 discount.\n\nUltimately, the required counteroffer keeping in mind decision mistakes and 104 threshold is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 1, 3]}\n\nThis offer leaves me:\n- 2 units of item 1: 12\n- 2 units of item 2: 10\n- 2 units of item 3: 12\n- 3 units of item 4: 21\n- 5 units of item 5: 35\n\nTotal value shooting for = 90 (a balance to expect better rounds).

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 31. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 31. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 75 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

My private per-unit values are [10, 1, 4, 4, 6] and the total amounts available are [4, 4, 3, 4, 8].\n3. The current offer gives me [2, 2, 1, 1, 3]. Calculating my total value:\n\u2003\u2003- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n\u2003\u2003- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n\u2003\u2003- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n\u2003\u2003- Item 4: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n\u2003\u2003- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n\u2003\u2003Total = 20 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 18 = 48.\n4. Since this round has no discount (gamma^(0) = 1), my value remains 48.\n5. The current offer (48) is substantially higher than my fallback of 31, and any counteroffer would need to beat this value despite the risk of moving to a future round (which discounts the outcome).\n6.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 92. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 92. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 99 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

With the discount factor for round 2, this value is adjusted: 60 \u00d7 (0.9^1) = 54.\n\n   - My outside offer value is 92, which is higher than the discounted value of the current offer (54).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer is worth less (54) than my outside offer (92).\n   - Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away would yield me 92, which is higher than the current offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, it's best to make a counteroffer that aims for a higher total value while still being advantageous over my outside offer. Let's propose a specific counteroffer.\n\nCounteroffer: Aim to achieve a value slightly above the outside offer. I will try to keep most of the high-value items to maximize my total value.\n\nPropose a counteroffer distribution:\n- Item 1: Offer 6 (I keep 3)\n- Item 2: Offer 0 (I keep 4)\n- Item 3: Offer 2 (I keep 2)\n- Item 4: Offer 2 (I keep 1)\n- Item 5: Offer 1 (I keep 2)\n\nLet's calculate the new value to me if I make this offer:\n\n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 6 = 18\n- Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 9 = 36\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 3 = 6\n- Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\nTotal value: 83\n\nThis proposal results in a value that, with the discount, equals 83 \u00d7 (0.9^1) = 74.7, still lower than my outside offer. I'll shift more for higher value:\n\nFinal Counteroffer:\n- Item 1: Offer 5 (I keep 4) \n- Item 2: Offer 0 (I keep 4)\n- Item 3: Offer 3 (I keep 1) \n- Item 4: Offer 2 (I keep 1) \n- Item 5: Offer 1 (I keep 2) \n\nRecalculate values:\n- Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 6 = 24\n- Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 9 = 36\n- Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 3 = 3\n- Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\nTotal value: 86\n\nThis will be adjusted for the discount to yield 86 \u00d7 (0.9^1) = 77.4, still below, but potentially more negotiable:\n\nNow I will propose a different counteroffer for a real shot:\n\nCounteroffer: Optimize fill to maximize:\n- Item 1: Offer 5 (I keep 4) \n- Item 2: Offer 0 (I keep 4)\n- Item 3: Offer 2 (I keep 2) \n- Item 4: Offer 2 (I keep 1) \n- Item 5: Offer 1 (I keep 2) \n\nTotal: Offers me a non-optimal idea quality but potentially better for negotiation grounds to gain a worthwhile offer amount: \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 2, 2, 1]}",

So, getting a favorable deal earlier rounds is typically better.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer on the table is none.\n   - I need to explore potential counteroffers.\n   - My goal should be to find a division where the total value to me exceeds my outside offer value of 110.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - I should structure a counteroffer such that my retained value is greater than 110, accounting for the discount factor.\n   - Let's consider offering Player 2: [2 items of type 1, 3 items of type 2, 6 items of type 3, 1 item of type 4, 2 items of type 5]. \n   - This means I'll keep: \n     - 3 items of type 1: value = 3 * 8 = 24\n     - 4 items of type 2: value = 4 * 8 = 32\n     - 0 items of type 3: value = 0 * 2 = 0\n     - 3 items of type 4: value = 3 * 4 = 12\n     - 0 items of type 5: value = 0 * 5 = 0\n   - Total value = 24 + 32 + 0 + 12 + 0 = 68 (which is less than 110 and thus not acceptable).\n\nGiven this analysis, my proposed offer doesn't exceed my outside offer value, so I need a better offer. I will try offering fewer items:\n\n- Offer Player 2: [1 item of type 1, 2 item of type 2, 6 items of type 3, 0 item of type 4, 2 items of type 5]\n- I keep: \n  - 4 items of type 1: value = 4 * 8 = 32\n  - 5 items of type 2: value = 5 * 8 = 40\n  - 0 items of type 3: value = 0 * 2 = 0\n  - 4 items of type 4: value = 4 * 4 = 16\n  - 0 items of type 5: value = 0 * 5 = 0\n- Total value = 32 + 40 + 0 + 16 + 0 = 88 (this still does not exceed my outside offer value).\n\nSince I initially miscalculated, instead I'll propose a more favorable division: \n- Offer Player 2: [0 item of type 1, 0 item of type 2, 6 items of type 3, 1 item of type 4, 2 items of type 5]\n- I keep:\n  - 5 items of type 1: value = 5 * 8 = 40\n  - 7 items of type 2: value = 7 * 8 = 56\n  - 0 item of type 3: value = 0 * 2 = 0\n  - 3 items of type 4: value = 3 * 4 = 12\n  - 0 item of type 5: value = 0 * 5 = 0\n- Total value = 40 + 56 + 0 + 12 + 0 = 108 (still less than 110)\n\nBecause finding a single powerful counteroffer is challenging immediately, I will choose to WALK until I can receive or counter with a sum greater or equal to 110.\n\nThus, for round 1, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 1, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, I prefer to conclude a negotiation sooner rather than later, if the offer is advantageous.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2 to evaluate.\n   - To make a counteroffer, I must find a division that gives me a value higher than my outside offer value of 88.\n   - Currently, the value of all items if I keep them all:\n     - Total value = (5 \u00d7 7) + (2 \u00d7 7) + (3 \u00d7 6) + (4 \u00d7 9) + (5 \u00d7 1) = 108\n   - I will propose a counteroffer where I keep items worth more than 88.\n\nLet's evaluate possible divisions to form a counteroffer:\n\n- If I propose offering Player 2:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\nThen I will keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 worth 21\n- 2 units of item 2 worth 14\n- 2 units of item 3 worth 12\n- 2 units of item 4 worth 18\n- 1 unit of item 5 worth 1\n- Total value = 21 + 14 + 12 + 18 + 1 = 66\n\nThis offer is not valid because it doesn\u2019t give me a value higher than my outside offer. Let me refine:\n\n- If I propose offering Player 2:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\nThen I keep:\n- 1 unit of item 1 worth 7\n- 1 unit of item 2 worth 7\n- 2 units of item 3 worth 12\n- 1 unit of item 4 worth 9\n- 0 units of item 5 worth 0\n- Total value = 7 + 7 + 12 + 9 + 0 = 35\n\nThis is not satisfactory either.\n\nTherefore, let me try again with a fairer distribution that respects these constraints and the value potential.\n\n- If I propose offering Player 2:\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\nThen I will keep:\n- 2 units of item 1 worth 14\n- 1 unit of item 2 worth 7\n- 2 units of item 3 worth 12\n- 2 units of item 4 worth 18\n- 2 units of item 5 worth 2\n- Total value = 14 + 7 + 12 + 18 + 2 = 53\n\nGiven the calculations, none of my attempts to make a meaningful counter-offer that guarantees me a value above 88 have worked.\n\nTherefore, I will offer a compromise or aim to refine my strategy considering potential dynamics from the opponent. But based on this current situation, my counterproposal:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\nPossibly pushes the negotiation, allowing a new counter dynamic.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To decide my action, I need to analyze the current situation:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 77.\n   - My values for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 7\n     - Item 2: 8\n     - Item 3: 10\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 8\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, which impacts the present value of accepting delayed offers by reducing their worth by 10% per round.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer on the table for me to evaluate, I need to consider potential counteroffers I might propose.\n   - I need to construct a counteroffer that ensures the value of the items I receive is at least 77 to match my outside offer value.\n\n3) **Propose a Counteroffer:**\n   - Calculate my current total value by offering minimal units of high-value items to Player 2, ensuring my retained value exceeds my outside offer.\n   - Propose a division:\n     - Offer Player 2 minimal units of items that have less value to me, while retaining a majority of high-value items.\n   \nLet's make a strategic counteroffer:\n\n- My highest valued items are items 2, 3, and 5. I should aim to keep most of these.\n- For example, offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1 (I keep all 2, value to me: 2 * 7 = 14)\n  - 0 units of item 2 (I keep all 1, value to me: 1 * 8 = 8)\n  - 1 unit of item 3 (I keep 1, value to me: 1 * 10 = 10)\n  - 6 units of item 4 (I keep 0, value to me: 0 * 1 = 0)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (I keep 3, value to me: 3 * 8 = 24)\n\n Total value to me from the above counteroffer = 14 (item 1) + 8 (item 2) + 10 (item 3) + 0 (item 4) + 24 (item 5) = 56\n\nThis value does not exceed my outside offer, so I must adjust to reach more than 77. Adjusting further to:\n\n- Offer:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3 (I keep 2, value to me: 2 * 10 = 20)\n  - 6 units of item 4 (I keep 0, value to me: 0)\n  - 2 units of item 5 (I keep 4, value to me: 4 * 8 = 32)\n\n Total value to me from this revised counteroffer = 14 (item 1) + 8 (item 2) + 20 (item 3) + 0 (item 4) + 32 (item 5) = 74\n\nThis is still below 77, I should offer a more balanced approach giving slightly less of item 5:\n\n- Offer:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3 (I keep 1, value to me: 10)\n  - 6 units of item 4 (I keep 0, value to me: 0)\n  - 1 unit of item 5 (I keep 5, value to me: 40)\n\nTotal value to me now = 14 (item 1) + 8 (item 2) + 10 (item 3) + 0 (item 4) + 40 (item 5) = 72\n\nSince finding precise math calculations to surpass 77 is challenging due to the item values and offers generated randomly, I must adjust more on item 5 and accept maximized item values like item 3 retention.\n\n**Final Counteroffer:**\n- I focus on minimizing item loss on principle part and leverage item 5 a bit more if reaching minimum retention of 76. Offering a submissive optimum beyond principle constraints:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide the best action, I'll go through the considerations step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation**:\n   - **My outside offer value**: 86\n   - **Values of the items involved**:\n     - Item 1: 3 per unit\n     - Item 2: 7 per unit\n     - Item 3: 7 per unit\n     - Item 4: 3 per unit\n     - Item 5: 5 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items**:\n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 0 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor**: Doesn't apply yet as it's the first round and I have to set an initial offer. However, it will affect future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**:\n   - **Current offer**: None, as this is the first round.\n   - **Potential counteroffers**: Here, I will determine the value of different divisions.\n\n     I want to ensure that my portion is worth more than my outside offer of 86. To calculate that, I will test keeping different portions:\n     \n     Suppose I offer the opponent the following distribution, aiming for a value notably higher than 86 for myself:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 0 units of item 5\n\n     This would mean I keep:\n     - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n     - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n     - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n\n     Total value = 12 + 28 + 28 + 6 = 74\n\n     Since 74 is less than my outside offer of 86, I must propose a division that keeps more value.\n\n     Let\u2019s try another offer:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n\n     This would mean I keep:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n     - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n     \n     Total value = 9 + 21 + 21 + 6 = 57\n\n     Still, not above 86, thus I need to optimize more towards my advantage.\n\n     For a more advantageous scenario:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n\n     I keep:\n     - 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n     - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n     - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n\n     Total value = 15 + 28 + 28 + 6 = 77\n\n     The calculation indicates my proposals are not enough to exceed my valuation of 86. \n\n3) **Make a decision**:\n   - Given that none of the proposed counteroffers exceed my outside offer value of 86, an acceptable counteroffer must prioritize my gain even more heavily. Therefore, I will revert to:\n     - Offering 0 units of item 1\n     - Offering 0 units of item 2\n     - Offering 0 units of item 3\n     - Offering 0 units of item 4\n     - Offering 0 units of item 5\n\n  It strikes toward my aim of crossing my outside offer or coaxing a favorable reception from Player 2 in this opening round, maximizing possible negotiation rounds.\n\n   Therefore, a reasonable starting proposal emphasizing self-retention is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Let's construct a counteroffer that keeps me above this threshold:\n\n- Let's propose keeping 3 units of Item 1, 4 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, and 2 units of Item 5:\n  - Value from Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n  - Value from Item 2 = 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n  - Value from Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n  - Value from Item 4 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - Value from Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- Total Value = 21 + 20 + 8 + 0 + 20 = 69\n\nThis total value of 69 is still below my outside offer, so I should still attempt to offer as little as possible to Player 2 while maximizing what I get:\n\nLet's modify the offer to:\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, and 3 units of Item 5.\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 3 units of Item 1, 6 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 2 units of Item 5:\n  - Value from Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n  - Value from Item 2 = 6 \u00d7 5 = 30\n  - Value from Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n  - Value from Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n  - Value from Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- Total Value = 21 + 30 + 8 + 1 + 20 = 80\n\n### Conclusion:\nProposing [1, 2, 0, 0, 3] gives me 80, which is still below my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 118. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 81 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

It only affects if negotiations proceed to further rounds. Specifically, values will be discounted by 0.9 per additional round concluded, influencing whether future offers are more favorable compared to today.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer value (None):** Since there is no current offer, we move to potential counteroffers.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Given my outside offer value of 100, I need to ensure any offer allows me to hold a value greater than or equal to 100 to avoid Mistake 2. One strategy is to focus on high-value items.\n     - For example, if I retain more units of high-value items like Item 3:\n       - If I keep all units of items except offering:\n         - 2 units of Item 1\n         - 1 unit of Item 2\n         - 3 units of Item 3\n         - 1 unit of Item 4\n         - 4 units of Item 5\n\n     Calculating what I'll keep:\n     - Keeping 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n     - Keeping 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n     - Keeping 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n     - Keeping 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n     - Keeping 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - Total value = 58, which is lower than my outside offer of 100\n  \n   - I need to adjust: Let's try a more favorable split:\n     - Offer 0 units of item 1\n     - Offer 0 units of item 2 \n     - Offer 3 units of item 3\n     - Offer 1 unit of item 4\n     - Offer 5 units of item 5\n  \n   Calculating what I'll keep:\n   - Keeping 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n   - Keeping 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n   - Keeping 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 9 = 36\n   - Keeping 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n   - Keeping 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - Total value = 73, which is still lower than my outside offer of 100\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - I need to keep at least the value of my outside offer, 100, based on this division approach, offering a minimal yet strategic offer that leaves substantial value for myself.\n\nI will present an aggressive first offer that maximizes value retention for my own benefits where possible. Let's try an offer that targets me keeping my outside offer equivalent:\n\n   Let's update the offer:\n\n     Offer 2 units of item 1\n     Offer 3 units of item 2 \n     Offer 2 units of item 3\n     Offer 0 units of item 4\n     Offer 5 units of item 5  \n\nCalculating what I'll keep:\n\n   - Keeping 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n   - Keeping 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   - Keeping 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n   - Keeping 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n   - Keeping 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - Total value = 65\n   \nMy offer wasn't accounting correctly my outside offer value. Let's approach again:\n\nOffer:\n - Item 1: 1 unit\n - Item 2: 0 units \n - Item 3: 0 units\n - Item 4: 0 units\n - Item 5: 5 units\n\nWhat I'll keep:\n   - Keeping 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n   - Keeping 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n   - Keeping 7 units of item 3 = 7 \u00d7 9 = 63\n   - Keeping 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n   - Keeping 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - Total value = 96\n\nThis offer aligns well with my outside offer value, without significantly undermining the counterpart's potential interest, with item 5 surplus maximization for their valuation estimation. Given that, here is my proposed offer action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 5]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 39. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 63 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The objective is to maximize my payout while making a fair offer to Player 2. \n\nOne potential counteroffer structure is making sure I get maximum value within the limits of item distribution:\n\n- Try keeping:\n  - Item 1: 3 units (3 x 7 = 21)\n  - Item 2: 0 units (0 x 2 = 0)\n  - Item 3: 5 units (5 x 9 = 45)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (2 x 3 = 6)\n  - Item 5: 3 units (3 x 1 = 3)\n\n- Value of my counteroffer: 21 + 0 + 45 + 6 + 3 = 75\n\n#### Discounted Value of My Counteroffer:\n- Discounted Value in Round 2 = 75 \u00d7 0.9 = 67.5\n\nThis is still lower than my outside offer value of 100. Thus, any realistic counteroffer in this configuration does not exceed the value of walking away.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nConsidering the current offer gives much less value than my outside offer and my counteroffer does not exceed the value of 100 after discounting, the best action based on this analysis is to WALK away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
