If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

The current offer is worth less than my outside offer.\n   \n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     - I need to propose something where my value is greater than 148 after gamma discount.\n     - I receive:\n       - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n       - 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n       - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n       - 3 units of Item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n       - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n     - Total available without gamma discount = 141 + 80 + 92 + 276 + 59 = 648\n\n    Since it's round 1, I should try a counteroffer that maximizes my total value above 148, taking into account the discount for future rounds.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer is less than my outside offer, so I shouldn't accept it.\n   - I can try a counteroffer instead of walking away.\n\nLet's propose:\n- Give 0 units of Item 1 to Player 1 (I keep 3, which values 141)\n- Give 0 units of Item 2 to Player 1 (I keep 1, which values 80)\n- Give 0 units of Item 3 to Player 1 (I keep 2, which values 92)\n- Give 3 units of Item 4 to Player 1 (I keep 1, which values 92)\n- Give 0 units of Item 5 to Player 1 (I keep 1, which values 59)\n\nValue to me:\n- Item 1: 141\n- Item 2: 80\n- Item 3: 92\n- Item 4: 92\n- Item 5: 59\n- Total = 464 - I give away 3 units of Item 4\n\nMy new offer provides me with a value of 274, which is significantly higher than my outside offer. \n\nHere\u2019s the counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 573. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 591 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To analyze the current situation, let's go through the steps:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 573.\n   - Values of the items involved:\n       - Item 1: 48\n       - Item 2: 51\n       - Item 3: 16\n       - Item 4: 9\n       - Item 5: 73\n   - Total pool of items: \n       - Item 1: 2 units\n       - Item 2: 3 units\n       - Item 3: 3 units\n       - Item 4: 5 units\n       - Item 5: 4 units\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) affects the present value of future negotiations. A deal in round 1 maintains full value, while future rounds reduce value due to the discount.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer ([0, 0, 3, 0, 2]):\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 51 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n       - Total value of current offer = 0 + 0 + 48 + 0 + 146 = 194\n\n   - My outside offer is 573, which is much higher than the current offer value of 194. \n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer would yield a total value of 194, compared to my outside offer of 573. Therefore, Accepting would be a mistake as it provides less value than my outside offer (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away with my outside offer provides a value of 573.\n   - I can make a counteroffer to maximize value received from the items.\n\nTo avoid Mistake 2, any counteroffer should aim for a total value higher than 573. Let's determine a counteroffer with a higher value:\n\nAssuming a counteroffer where I propose the following distribution to Player 1:\n\nCounteroffer I propose: \n- [2, 2, 0, 4, 2] offering:\n\nFor myself (remaining):\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n\nTotal value to me for counteroffer: 0 + 51 + 48 + 9 + 146 = 254\n\nI realize this value isn't over 573 either. Given the challenge, I see a strong justification for walking away since achieving over 573 within constraints might be critically difficult.\n\nTherefore, the optimal action is to walk away, as I cannot make a counteroffer that objectively surpasses my fallback option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

As this is round 1, \\(\\gamma^{0} = 1\\), so the present value is not yet affected, but in future rounds, it will be reduced if the negotiation continues.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer Value:**\n     - Item 4: 7 units \u00d7 43 = 301\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Total value = 309\n   - My outside offer value is 436, which is higher than 309.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze and calculate step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 436\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 16\n  - Item 2: 56\n  - Item 3: 55\n  - Item 4: 43\n  - Item 5: 8\n- **Total Pool of Items**: [3, 3, 2, 7, 1]\n- **Current Offer**: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor impacts the value of future outcomes. Since it's round 2, the discount factor for this round is \\( \\gamma^{1} = 0.9 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**:\n   - Item 4: 7 units \u00d7 43 = 301 (value of item 4)\n   - Total Value of Current Offer to me = 301\n   - Adjusted Value with Discount: \\( 301 \\times 0.9 = 270.9 \\)\n\n2. **Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n   - My outside offer value is 436, which is significantly higher than 270.9.\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffer**: I need a division that provides me with more than my outside offer, adjusted for the discount factor.\n   - Let's maximize my value by keeping high-value items.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\nSince the current offer (270.9) is far less than my outside offer (436) even after adjusting with the discount factor, accepting it would not be wise.\n\n**Propose a Counteroffer**:\n- Aim to keep more valuable items:\n  - I can propose to take all units for Item 2 (my highest value item).\n  - And propose to give them fewer of other items.\n\nLet's draft a counteroffer maximizing my value significantly above 436:\n\n#### Counteroffer Calculations:\n\n1. **Offer Player 1**: [0, 0, 2, 5, 0]\n   - I keep: [3, 3, 0, 2, 1]\n   - My Value Calculation:\n     - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n     - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n     - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - Total Value = 48 + 168 + 0 + 86 + 8 = 310\n     - Adjusted Value: 310 \u00d7 0.9 = 279\n\nThis counteroffer would also not provide me a value greater than my outside offer.\n\nFor this negotiation to outperform my outside offer, I need to adjust even further. Let's try a different counterproposal:\n\n#### Optimal Counteroffer:\n\n- **Offer Player 1**: [1, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n  - My keep: [2, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n  - Final Value Calculation:\n    - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n    - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n    - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n    - Total Value = 32 + 168 + 110 + 0 + 8 = 318\n    - Adjusted Value: 318 \u00d7 0.9 = 286.2\n\nThis value doesn't help either, considering I can't perfectly maximize beyond 436 here; let's submit a more assertive counteroffer or decide to walk.\n\nGiven the constraints, the best course of action is to attempt one more improved counterproposal. \nHowever, considering the risks of not achieving my outside value, what I could feasibly offer:\n\n- Offer **[0, 2, 1, 5, 0]** for a potential value, but that would still lean below the outside offer after adjustments.\n\nThus the clarity arises: maximizing through another prolonged high value is not evident, so safe walkthrough structures my choices:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My outside offer is 346. I have 6 units of item 1 valued at 64 each, 3 units of item 2 valued at 55 each, 5 units of item 3 valued at 6 each, 7 units of item 4 valued at 88 each, and 8 units of item 5 valued at 20 each. That gives a total potential value of 1355 if I got every unit. Because the discount factor in round 1 is 1 (no discount yet), any deal that gives me less than my fallback of 346 is unacceptable.\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I need to propose an initial counteroffer. I want to keep as much as possible of the high-value items (items 1, 2, and 4) while making a concession on items that are of lower importance to me (especially item 3 and partly item 5). However, I do want to offer enough to the opponent so that they will consider accepting rather than risk waiting (especially given their own private outside offer and the possibility of discounting later).\n\nOne strategy is to give up very little of the high\u2010value items and concede more on those items I value less. For example, if I give the opponent 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 2 while keeping the rest, I lose 64 and 55 in my own value but that may help persuade them. I do not value item 3 much (only 6 per unit) so I can concede all 5, and for item 4 (my highest valued at 88 per unit) I may want to concede a bit more (say 3 out of 7) to make the offer more attractive. For item 5 (worth 20 each), a modest concession (2 units) still lets me keep the majority.\n\nUnder this split:\n\u2022 I offer Player 2: \n\u2003\u2013 1 unit of item 1,\n\u2003\u2013 1 unit of item 2,\n\u2003\u2013 all 5 units of item 3,\n\u2003\u2013 3 units of item 4, and \n\u2003\u2013 2 units of item 5.\n\u2022 I keep:\n\u2003\u2013 5 units of item 1 (5\u00d764 = 320),\n\u2003\u2013 2 units of item 2 (2\u00d755 = 110),\n\u2003\u2013 0 units of item 3 (0\u00d76 = 0),\n\u2003\u2013 4 units of item 4 (4\u00d788 = 352), and\n\u2003\u2013 6 units of item 5 (6\u00d720 = 120).\nThis gives me a total value of 320 + 110 + 0 + 352 + 120 = 902, which is far above my fallback of 346. While this is very favorable to me, it also concedes enough of the lower-valued items and a moderate amount of the highest valued good (item 4) to potentially give Player 2 an incentive to settle early.\n\nBased on this analysis, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 5, 3, 2]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 5, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 5, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To evaluate the current offer and decide on the best action, let's go through the analysis:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** \n  - My outside offer value is 951.\n\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 31\n  - Item 2: 10\n  - Item 3: 19\n  - Item 4: 56\n  - Item 5: 33\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 7 units of item 4\n  - 8 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:** \n  - The discount factor is 0.9. This discount factor reduces the effective value of any arrangement if more rounds are used. In round 1, this factor has no effect (0.9^0 = 1). \n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer from Player 1 (given to me):** \n  - [1, 1, 5, 3, 2]\n\n  My value for accepting this offer:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n  - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 19 = 95\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n  - **Total value of the current offer = 31 + 10 + 95 + 168 + 66 = 370**\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n  - 370 from the current offer is much lower than my outside offer of 951.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer:** \n  - Not advantageous, as 370 is less than my outside offer of 951.\n\n- **Walk Away:** \n  - Comparatively better than accepting the current offer since my outside offer gives me 951.\n\n- **Counteroffer:**\n  - To make a viable counteroffer, it must give me a value greater than 951 (or very close when considering future rounds with discount).\n\nConsidering that making a counteroffer in the first round might lead to better negotiations, but I must avoid offers yielding less than my outside value, I'll configure a counteroffer where I retain all the higher-value items, leveraging leverage associated with future rounds. \n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\n- Offer Player 1 the following (ensuring we maximize what I get currently):\n  - [3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5]\n\n**Calculation:**\n- My units:\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n  - 1 units of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n- **Total Value = 93 + 10 + 38 + 168 + 99 = 408**\n\n408 is still lower than my outside offer, and considering the discount of future rounds, a practical split would require fairness in the perspective of rounds ahead.\n\nGiven the substantial difference, it is better to WALK rather than proceed with negation that is unfavorably skewed. \n\nSo, my decision is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 981. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

To at least attempt to maximize my value above the outside offer.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer. I'll aim for a combination that gives me a higher value than 1010.\n\n### Counteroffer Calculation:\nI will need to distribute the items in a way that the sum of the values of items I receive exceeds 1010:\n\n- If I keep:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 38 = 152\n  - 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 72 = 504\n\n  The total value for me = 20 + 75 + 78 + 152 + 504 = 829\n\nThis value is still below my outside offer. Let's adjust to make a higher total:\n\n- Adjust and keep:\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 25 = 100\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 38 = 152\n  - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 72 = 432\n\n  Total value for me = 30 + 100 + 104 + 152 + 432 = 818\n\nStill under. Let's make another viable attempt since staying under won't help:\n\n- Keep:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n  - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 25 = 125\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 38 = 190\n  - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 72 = 432 \n\n  Total value for me = 40 + 125 + 104 + 190 + 432 = 891 (still struggling in calculation)\n\nIt seems that with these random divisions, achieving above 1010 may not be possible in a simple balanced distribution.\n\nI'll attempt to adjust to reach or exceed 1010 in a different manner:\n\nPotential better attempt:\n\nI will propose:\n\nKeeping:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 25 = 125\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n- 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 38 = 190\n- 8 units of item 5 = 8 \u00d7 72 = 576\n   \nThis proposal exceeds or seeks to balance equal value insightful exceeding current standards; failing this we observe re-negotiation round 2. \n\nGiven, I must provide an offer while ensuring it's optimal repostulate a marginally adjusted keep front albeit moral on factuals indicate no immediate feasible.\n\n- Here is a revision counteroffer:\n  - Offer: [3, 4, 2, 3, 5] \n  - Keep: \n    - 1 unit of item 1\n    - 4 units of item 2\n    - 2 units of item 3\n    - 2 units of item 4\n    - 6 units of item 5\n  \n- Review values for the upcoming round adjustment:\n\nThus to minimize false steps while posturing noted calculations submission renders as so. Counter proceeds firm intent on value amelioration.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 2, 3, 5]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 2, 3, 5]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n- **My outside offer value:** 1010\n- **My values for the items:**\n  - Item 1: 10\n  - Item 2: 25\n  - Item 3: 26\n  - Item 4: 38\n  - Item 5: 72\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 8 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 8 units\n- **Discount factor:** 0.9 (applied to future rounds)\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n#### Current Offer: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]\nThe current offer provides me with:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = \\(1 \\times 10 = 10\\)\n- 2 units of item 2 = \\(2 \\times 25 = 50\\)\n- 2 units of item 3 = \\(2 \\times 26 = 52\\)\n- 2 units of item 4 = \\(2 \\times 38 = 76\\)\n- 3 units of item 5 = \\(3 \\times 72 = 216\\)\n\n**Total value of the current offer to me = 10 + 50 + 52 + 76 + 216 = 404**\n\nSince we are in Round 2, we don't apply the discount yet.\n\n#### Compare to Outside Offer:\nMy outside offer value is 1010, which is significantly higher than the current offer value of 404.\n\n### 3) Decision Making:\n- **Accept the current offer:** Not rational, as 404 is much lower than my outside offer of 1010.\n- **Walk away:** I get 1010, which is clearly better than accepting 404.\n- **Counteroffer:** I should propose an offer where I receive a value higher than my outside offer. Let's calculate a counteroffer:\n\n#### Proposed Counteroffer:\nTo achieve a value close to or above 1010, let's try to keep as much of high-value items as possible. A potential offer could be:\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 3, 1, 1, 3]\n\nLet's calculate the value to me if I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 = \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\)\n- 5 units of item 2 = \\(5 \\times 25 = 125\\)\n- 3 units of item 3 = \\(3 \\times 26 = 78\\)\n- 4 units of item 4 = \\(4 \\times 38 = 152\\)\n- 5 units of item 5 = \\(5 \\times 72 = 360\\)\n\n**Total value for me = 30 + 125 + 78 + 152 + 360 = 745**\n\nThis value is still below my outside offer. Let's try another distribution.\n\n#### New Proposed Counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\nLet's calculate the value to me if I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 = \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\)\n- 6 units of item 2 = \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\)\n- 3 units of item 3 = \\(3 \\times 26 = 78\\)\n- 4 units of item 4 = \\(4 \\times 38 = 152\\)\n- 6 units of item 5 = \\(6 \\times 72 = 432\\)\n\n**Total value for me = 30 + 150 + 78 + 152 + 432 = 842**\n\nEven this distribution doesn't reach 1010. This indicates I might need to walk away if the value doesn't cross the benchmark.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the constraints and my evaluation, none of the offers or counteroffers I considered exceed my guaranteed outside offer value. Therefore, I will choose to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Any division is defined by what I give Player 2; I keep the remainder. For example, if I offer x units for an item, I keep (total \u2013 x) for that item.\n4. Knowing that my proposal must yield a retained value, computed as:\n\u2003My value = (7 \u2013 a\u2081)*48 + (5 \u2013 a\u2082)*28 + (1 \u2013 a\u2083)*38 + (6 \u2013 a\u2084)*14 + (5 \u2013 a\u2085)*52,\n\u2003I must have this \u2265 453.\n5. A straightforward strategy is to claim the items that are most valuable to me (items 1, 3, and 5) in full, and offer the other items (items 2 and 4) entirely to Player 2. In this proposal:\n\u2003\u2022 I give 0 from item 1 (so I keep all 7, worth 7\u00d748 = 336).\n\u2003\u2022 I give all 5 units of item 2 (I keep 0; conceding 5\u00d728 = 140 in value).\n\u2003\u2022 I give 0 from item 3 (keep the 1 unit worth 38).\n\u2003\u2022 I give all 6 units of item 4 (I keep 0; conceding 6\u00d714 = 84).\n\u2003\u2022 I give 0 from item 5 (keep all 5, worth 5\u00d752 = 260).\n\u2003My retained total value = 336 + 38 + 260 = 634, which is well above 453.\n6. This proposal meets the criteria of not offering a deal worse than my alternative and avoids the mistakes:\n\u2003\u2013 It gives me more than my outside offer.\n\u2003\u2013 It does not offer \u201cnothing\u201d or \u201ceverything\u201d to Player 2.\n\u2003\u2013 It maintains my high-value items while conceding items with a lower per-unit value (from my perspective).\n7.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 499. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 660 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 324. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 648 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Clearly, 290 is much higher than 16.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Should I accept the current offer? Yes, because the offer's value (290) is substantially greater than my outside offer value (16).\n   - Should I walk away? No, since the current offer is significantly better than my outside offer.\n   - Should I propose a specific counteroffer? Since the current offer is already highly favorable, there's no need for a counteroffer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best course of action is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 848. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 984 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This gives a maximum total value (if I got everything) of 904.\n   - Because we are in round 1 the discount factor (gamma = 0.9) is applied as gamma^(round-1) so it is 0, meaning no discount. Thus, delaying the deal would lower potential value in future rounds.\n   \n2) In assessing offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table, so I must make the initial proposal.\n   - I need to ensure that the deal I offer to the opponent, if accepted, gives me a total value greater than my outside offer (167). In almost any division where I keep most of the high value items, I will get well above 167.\n   - I want to maximize my own outcome by keeping as much value as possible. For instance, if I propose an offer where I give the opponent very little \u2013 while still offering them a token amount \u2013 I would keep nearly all items. For example, if I propose to give them:\n         \u2022 0 units of item1 (leaving me 3 units),\n         \u2022 0 units of item2 (none available),\n         \u2022 1 unit of item3 (leaving me 7 units),\n         \u2022 1 unit of item4 (leaving me 4 units),\n         \u2022 1 unit of item5 (leaving me 3 units);\n   then my payoff would be:\n         \u2022 Item1: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n         \u2022 Item3: 7 \u00d7 32 = 224\n         \u2022 Item4: 4 \u00d7 47 = 188\n         \u2022 Item5: 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n      Total = 45 + 224 + 188 + 276 = 733, which is much higher than the fallback of 167.\n      \n3) Based on this analysis:\n   - I should not accept any offer (since none is on the table).\n   - My outside offer is much lower than what I would achieve by an agreement following my own proposal.\n   - I want to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value by offering the opponent minimal items, so I propose giving the opponent [0, 0, 1, 1, 1] respective units.\n\nThus, my action is to propose this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}",

Waiting may reduce the overall present value of any negotiated deal.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Offer Valuation:\n\u2022 My total value if I got all items would be 905.\n\u2022 To ensure any deal is better than my outside offer, the items I keep must have a total value of at least 866.\n\u2022 This means I can \u201cafford\u201d to give away items worth up to 905 \u2013 866 = 39 (in terms of my private valuations).\n\u2022 Looking at my valuations, the item that costs me the least (per unit) is item\u202f5, valued at 32 per unit. Giving away 1 unit of item\u202f5 costs me 32 value, leaving me with 905 \u2013 32 = 873, which is above my outside offer.\n\u2022 None of the other items can be given away safely in one unit because their per-unit cost is higher than 39.\n\u2022 Therefore, a safe initial counteroffer is to offer Player 2 exactly 1 unit of item 5, keeping the remainder. This gives me a deal value of 873, which is above my guaranteed alternative of 866, and it does not commit the common mistakes.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Decision:\nI should propose the counteroffer that gives Player 2 1 unit of item\u202f5. This meets my objective of ensuring my outcome remains above my outside option while opening a negotiation possibility.\n\nFinal Action in required JSON format:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's go through the required analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 793.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 77\n     - Item 2: 68\n     - Item 3: 91\n     - Item 4: 70\n     - Item 5: 40\n   - The total pool of items:\n     - 4 units of Item 1\n     - 4 units of Item 2\n     - 4 units of Item 3\n     - 1 unit of Item 4\n     - 2 units of Item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) affects the value of accepting offers in future rounds. Currently, we are in round 1, so the gamma factor is not applied yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n     - My total value if I accept it:\n       - 0 units of Item 1 = 0\n       - 0 units of Item 2 = 0\n       - 0 units of Item 3 = 0\n       - 0 units of Item 4 = 0\n       - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n       - Total value = 40\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:**\n     - The current offer value (40) is significantly less than my outside offer (793).\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4) since its value (40) is less than my outside offer (793).\n   - Walking away is not optimal unless no better offer can be made.\n   - Propose a counteroffer that maximizes my total value above the outside offer value (793) while offering a fair share to Player 1.\n\n**Formulate a Counteroffer:**\nLet's choose a division of items to propose as a counteroffer.\n- Propose giving Player 1 a fair share while ensuring my retained value exceeds 793. For example: \n  - Offer them 2 units of Item 5 because its value to me is the least.\n  - Offer them 2 units each of Item 1 and Item 2 as a compromise, ensuring I receive a substantial value from Items 3 and 4, which are most valuable to me.\n  \n- **My value from the counteroffer** if I keep [4, 2, 2, 1, 0]:\n  - 4 units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 77 = 308\n  - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n  - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n  - 0 units of Item 5 = 0\n  - Total value = 308 + 136 + 182 + 70 = 696\n\nHere, the proposal does not exceed the outside offer value. Let's adjust it:\n- My value if I keep [3, 2, 3, 1, 0]:\n  - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n  - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n  - 3 units of Item 3 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n  - 0 units of Item 5 = 0\n  - Total value = 710\n\nThe value again doesn't meet the offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 465. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means the value of accepting an offer decreases by 10% for each subsequent round. However, since it's the first round, the full value is considered.\n\n2. **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer from Player 1 ([0, 1, 0, 0, 6]):**\n     - My units if I accept:\n       - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 38 = 76\n       - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 19 = 19\n       - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 1 = 4\n       - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 18 = 72\n       - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 25 = 0\n     - Total Value if I Accept = 76 + 19 + 4 + 72 + 0 = 171\n   - **Compare to Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 244. The current offer results in a value of 171, which is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n3. **Make a Decision:**\n   - **Should I Accept?** No, because accepting would yield a value (171) less than my outside offer (244), violating Mistake 4.\n   - **Should I Walk Away?** Not immediately, since this is the first round and there is room to negotiate a better offer.\n   - **Should I Counteroffer?** Yes, I should propose a counteroffer that provides higher value than my outside offer to avoid Mistake 2.\n\nLet's find a counteroffer that could be appealing to Player 1 while ensuring my value exceeds 244. I need a combination providing a greater aggregate value:\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer to Player 1:** [1, 1, 4, 4, 1]\n\n- **My Units if Counter Offer is Accepted:**\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 38 = 38\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 19 = 19\n  - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 18 = 0\n  - Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 25 = 125\n- **My Total Value:** 38 + 19 + 0 + 0 + 125 = 182\n\nThis still doesn't reach 244. Try a different counteroffer:\n\nPropose another counteroffer: Items Player 2 receives: [1, 1, 4, 0, 2]\n\n- **My Units if Counter Offer is Accepted:**\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 38 = 38\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 19 = 19\n  - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 18 = 72\n  - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 25 = 100\n- **My Total Value:** 38 + 19 + 72 + 100 = 229\n\nTry final change:\n\nPropose another counteroffer: Items Player 2 receives: [1, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\n- **My Units if Counter Offer is Accepted:**\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 38 = 38\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 19 = 38\n  - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 18 = 72\n  - Item 5: 6 units \u00d7 25 = 150\n- **My Total Value:** 38 + 38 + 72 + 150 = 289\n\nSubmit best attempt with above proposal:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 4, 0, 0]}",

Thus reaching an agreement in round 1 avoids any discounting.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Evaluating potential offers:\n\u2022 I must ensure that the deal I propose gives me a present value at least as high as my fallback value of 1157.\n\u2022 I can concede at most 1328 \u2013 1157 = 171 in my own value.\n\u2022 Since I want to maximize my gain, I should keep the high\u2010value items (item 3 with 84 per unit and item 5 with 95 per unit) and concede items I value less.\n\u2022 Item 2 (only 1 available) and item 4 (value 13 each) are low in my valuation. Conceding these completely would give the opponent a total \u201ccost\u201d for me of 18 + 2\u00d713 = 44.\n\u2022 I could also concede one unit of item 1 (52 per unit) because although it isn\u2019t as low as items 2 and 4, it still helps the other party without costing me too much. Conceding one unit of item 1 adds 52, for a running total concession of 44 + 52 = 96, which is well below the maximum concession margin of 171.\n\u2022 With that offer, I keep: one unit of item 1 (52), all of item 3 (5 units \u2192 420), and all of item 5 (8 units \u2192 760).

My counteroffer will be based on retaining high-value items for myself. I should focus on item 1 and item 5, as they are the highest value items for me.\n\nLet's keep item 1 and item 5 while giving away less valuable items:\n\n- Offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 5, 2, 6]\n  - This means I keep:\n    - Item 1: 2 units\n    - Item 2: 1 unit\n    - Item 3: 0 units\n    - Item 4: 0 units\n    - Item 5: 2 units\n  - Value to me:\n    - Item 1: 2 units = 94 \u00d7 2 = 188\n    - Item 2: 1 unit = 65 \u00d7 1 = 65\n    - Item 5: 2 units = 94 \u00d7 2 = 188\n  - Total = 188 + 65 + 188 = 441\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer, suggesting I should continue negotiating.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "My reasoning:\n\n1. Current situation:\n\u2003\u2022 My outside offer value is 1157 (guaranteed if I walk away).\n\u2003\u2022 My private per\u2010unit values are: item1 = 52, item2 = 18, item3 = 84, item4 = 13, item5 = 95. The totals available for each item are: [2, 1, 5, 2, 8].\n\u2003\u2022 If I took all items, my raw total value would be 1328. In round 2 the deal is discounted by \u03b3^(2\u20131)=0.9, so a full\u2010allocation deal gives 0.9\u00d71328 = 1195.2. Thus, unless I get nearly all of the available value, accepting a deal in round 2 could be worse than my 1157 outside offer.\n\u2003\u2022 The current offer on the table is [0, 0, 3, 0, 1] (meaning I\u2019d get those units). That would give me only 3\u00d784 + 1\u00d795 = 252+95 = 347 raw value, which discounted (347\u00d70.9 \u2248 312) is far below my fallback.\n\n2. Assessing a counteroffer:\n\u2003\u2022 Since I value a deal in round 2 only if my raw value is at least 1157/0.9 \u2248 1286, I must keep at least 1286 of our total available 1328 value (a margin of only 42 points to concede).\n\u2003\u2022 To optimize my share, I want to give away items that are least valuable to me. My ranking from \u201cleast\u201d to \u201cmost\u201d valuable per unit is: item4 (13), item2 (18), then item1 (52), item3 (84), and item5 (95).\n\u2003\u2022 If I gave nothing, my share would be 1328 raw (1195.2 discounted) but offering nothing (i.e. a completely stingy offer) could lead Player 2 to reject the deal (this is one of the common mistakes, \u201coffering no items to the opponent\u201d).\n\u2003\u2022 A minimal concession strategy is to give a small amount from the low\u2010value items while keeping my own raw total at least 1286. For example:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Giving away 1 unit of item4 (worth 13) would leave me with 1328 \u2013 13 = 1315 raw (1183.5 discounted), but that offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] might be perceived as too stingy.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Instead, by giving away 1 unit of item2 (worth 18) and 1 unit of item4 (worth 13), I concede 18 + 13 = 31 raw points. This leaves me with 1328 \u2013 31 = 1297 raw which, when discounted, is 0.9\u00d71297 = 1167.3\u2014slightly above my outside offer.\n\u2003\u2022 This counteroffer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] (meaning I offer Player 2 1 unit of item2 and 1 unit of item4) maximizes my benefit while giving a minimal concession to encourage agreement.\n\n3. Decision:\n\u2003Since the current offer gives me far less than my fallback value, and the counteroffer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] yields me a discounted value of 1167.3 (which is better than 1157) while not \u201cwasting\u201d valuable items, I will propose that as my counteroffer.\n\nThe final action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}",

In round 1, this discount factor does not apply since \\((\\text{r-1}) = 0\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value**: The current offer gives me:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = \\(0 \\times 90 = 0\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = \\(1 \\times 17 = 17\\)\n  - 0 units of item 3 = \\(0 \\times 37 = 0\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = \\(1 \\times 34 = 34\\)\n  - 0 units of item 5 = \\(0 \\times 95 = 0\\)\n\n  Total value of the current offer = \\(17 + 34 = 51\\)\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: My outside offer is 364, which is significantly higher than the value of the current offer (51).\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to consider a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 364. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n  - Keeping 3 units of item 1 and 1 unit of item 5:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = \\(3 \\times 90 = 270\\)\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = \\(1 \\times 95 = 95\\)\n    - Total value = \\(270 + 95 = 365\\)\n  \n  This counteroffer just barely exceeds my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nBased on the analysis above, the current offer is not satisfactory since its value (51) is well below my outside offer value (364).

Since we're in round 1, the discount effect is minimal now but grows as rounds increase.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current offer to me [1, 1, 0, 6, 0]**:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n  - 0 unit of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 40 = 0\n  - 6 unit of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 28 = 168\n  - 0 unit of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 82 = 0\n  - **Total value if I accept the offer**: 5 + 70 + 0 + 168 + 0 = 243\n\n- **Comparison to outside offer value**:\n  - The value from accepting the current offer is 243, which is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 1021.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n- **Accepting**: Accepting yields only 243, which is far lower than 1021; thus, it's worse than my outside offer.\n- **Walking away**: This will give me 1021 instantly.\n- **Counteroffer**: I need to propose a counteroffer better than my outside offer value.\n\nLet's construct a possible counteroffer that aims to improve my position. I'll prioritize high-value items and propose a division where my total value exceeds my outside offer, while still being reasonable for Player 1 to consider. \n\nConsidering the total pool and my value per unit, I will aim for a configuration that maximizes my high-value items (e.g., Item 2 and Item 5).\n\n#### Possible Counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 1:\n  - Item 1: 4\n  - Item 2: 2\n  - Item 3: 1\n  - Item 4: 0\n  - Item 5: 1\n\nThis reserves the high-value items for me while being more balanced.\n\nMy potential allocation:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 40 = 80\n- 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 28 = 168\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n- **Total value**: 10 + 350 + 80 + 168 + 246 = 854 (which is still less than my outside offer)\n\nBalancing a higher value configuration with the risk that Player 1 may not accept is key.

Since we are in round 2, any accepted offer value will be multiplied by 0.9 to adjust for the discount. Walking away does not incur a discount.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]\n     - My total value if I accept it:\n       - Item 4: 6 units x 28 (value per unit) = 168\n     - Total value = 168\n     - After applying the discount factor for round 2: 168 x 0.9 = 151.2\n     - This is well below my outside offer of 1021.\n   - **Previous Offers:**\n     - My initial offer to Player 1: [4, 2, 1, 0, 1], giving me:\n       - Item 1: 2 units x 5 = 10\n       - Item 2: 5 units x 70 = 350\n       - Item 3: 2 units x 40 = 80\n       - Item 4: 6 units x 28 = 0\n       - Item 5: 3 units x 82 = 246\n     - Total value = 686, adjusted for round 1, its value was 686.\n   - Aiming for a value greater than 1021, I should be retaining the most valuable items, especially item 5.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Current Offer: It provides a very low value, less than both my outside offer and has a discount applied.\n   - I could propose a counteroffer to maximize retained high-value items.\n\nLet's go for a counteroffer optimizing my highest value items:\n\n- I'll keep all units of item 5 (to maximize value from high value item).\n- Allocate minimal items without making the mistake of offering nothing.\n- Proposed counteroffer: [1, 1, 0, 6, 0]\n\n- **Ensuring No Mistake:** My counteroffer helps me retain more items to maximize retained value.\n   \nTotal value under my retention would be: \n- Item 1: 5 units x 5 = 25\n- Item 2: 6 units x 70 = 420\n- Item 3: 3 units x 40 = 120\n- Item 5: 4 units x 82 = 328\nTotal value = 893, still discounted (893 x 0.9 in final value consideration = 803.7) but better positioning than prior offer for healthy negotiations, still maximizing Item 5.\n\nGiven this approach maximizes my interests yet considers potential collaboration, it's justified to propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 6, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. My outside offer guarantees me 590 in utility. My own total \u201cfull value\u201d (if I got every item) is 873. In any deal I propose, I must ensure that my share (the items I keep, which are the pool minus the offer to Player 2) gives me a value \u2265590.\n\n2. My per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 8\u2003\u2003\u2013 total available 5 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 80\u2003\u2003\u2013 total available 4 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 40\u2003\u2003\u2013 total available 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 15\u2003\u2003\u2013 total available 3 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 87\u2003\u2003\u2013 total available 4 units\n\nIf I took everything, I\u2019d have:\n\u2003\u20035\u00d78 + 4\u00d780 + 3\u00d740 + 3\u00d715 + 4\u00d787 = 873.\nThus, to secure a deal that is better than my fallback, I need to \u201chold\u201d at least 590 in value. In round 1 there is no discount (\u03b3^(r\u20131)=1).\n\n3. A good strategy is to \u201cconcede\u201d items that I value relatively less while keeping the high\u2010value items (item 2 and item 5) for myself. One natural idea is to offer Player 2 all of the items that give me low value (items 1, 3, and 4) and keep the high\u2010value ones (items 2 and 5) for myself. Checking that:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Items I keep: item 2: 4 units (4\u00d780=320) and item 5: 4 units (4\u00d787=348). Their total value = 320+348 = 668.\n\u2003\u2003668 is safely above my fallback of 590.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Items I concede to Player 2: item 1: all 5 units, item 3: all 3 units, and item 4: all 3 units.\n\u2003\u2003This gives Player 2 the offer [5, 0, 3, 3, 0] (i.e. nothing of item 2 and item 5).\n\n4. This proposed counteroffer avoids the mistakes of offering a deal that would leave me with less than my fallback (Mistake 2) or \u201ccaving in\u201d too much. Although I cannot be sure what value this gives Player 2 (their private values are unknown), by offering them items that I value less I am at least making a division that gives me 668, which is a strict improvement over my outside option, yet leaves something seemingly attractive to the other party.\n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to offer the division where Player 2 gets: item 1: 5, item 2: 0, item 3: 3, item 4: 3, and item 5: 0.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 3, 3, 0]}",

Currently, since it's the first round, gamma doesn't influence the current calculation.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer**: [1, 0, 1, 1, 2] (This is the offer made to me)\n  - My value for this current offer:\n    - 1 unit of Item 1: 92 \u00d7 1 = 92\n    - 0 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 0 = 0\n    - 1 unit of Item 3: 15 \u00d7 1 = 15\n    - 1 unit of Item 4: 76 \u00d7 1 = 76\n    - 2 units of Item 5: 96 \u00d7 2 = 192\n    - Total value = 92 + 0 + 15 + 76 + 192 = 375\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer Value**: \n  - Current offer value (375) < Outside offer value (674)\n\nSince the current offer value to me is lower than my outside offer value, accepting the current offer would be worse than my outside fallback option (Mistake 4). Therefore, I should not accept the current offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nGiven the current offer is worse than my outside offer and considering I should aim for a better deal, a counteroffer should be formulated to ensure it provides a better value than my outside offer:\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer**:\n  - Aim to retain a larger amount of high-value items (Items 1, 4, and 5) while considering a reasonable division.\n  - For example, propose the following distribution to the opponent: [3, 0, 2, 3, 4]\u2014meaning I offer Player 1:\n    - 3 units of Item 1\n    - 0 units of Item 2\n    - 2 units of Item 3\n    - 3 units of Item 4\n    - 4 units of Item 5\n  - My retained amount would therefore be: [3, 0, 2, 2, 4].\n  - Calculate corresponding value:\n    - Value of 3 units Item 1: 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n    - Value of 0 units of Item 2: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n    - Value of 2 units Item 3: 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n    - Value of 2 units Item 4: 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n    - Value of 4 units Item 5: 4 \u00d7 96 = 384\n    - Total retained value = 276 + 0 + 30 + 152 + 384 = 842\n\nAs this offer yields a total value (842) greater than my outside offer (674), it's a strategic counteroffer that maximizes my utility while ensuring it remains acceptable.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer. Here it is in the correct format:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 3, 4]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

Since it is round 2, this factor will start influencing the evaluation of future offers if there is a third round.\n\n2) **Value Assessment:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** [1, 0, 4, 1, 1] (Offered to me)\n     - Value of accepting the offer:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 92 = 92\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n       - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 15 = 60\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n     - Total value if I accept = 92 + 0 + 60 + 76 + 96 = 324\n\n     This value of 324 is less than my outside offer of 674, so accepting this offer is not an option.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a total value exceeding 674.\n     - Consider possible divisions keeping in mind avoiding mistakes, especially Mistake 2 (offering so much that my value falls below 674).\n\n     A potentially good offer for me could be achieving a total value above 674. Let's try a counteroffer where Player 1 gets less:\n     - **Counteroffer Proposal:** [3, 0, 2, 2, 4] (to Player 1)\n       - My keeps = [3, 0, 2, 3, 4]\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228\n       - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 96 = 384\n       - Total value = 276 + 0 + 30 + 228 + 384 = 918\n\n     This value exceeds my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decide on Action:**\n\n   - The current offer provides me a lower value (324) compared to my outside offer (674), so I will not accept it.\n   - A counteroffer that exceeds the value of my outside offer should be made. The calculated counteroffer gives me a value of 918, which is better than both the current offer and my outside offer.\n   - Therefore, I will propose the counteroffer [3, 0, 2, 2, 4].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 2, 4]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 674. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 843 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My analysis is as follows:\n\n1. Our fallback (\u201coutside offer\u201d) gives us 1011 points and is guaranteed. In contrast, the current offer (receiving [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]) gives value computed as:\n\u2003\u20030\u00d787 + 1\u00d782 + 2\u00d788 + 2\u00d731 + 3\u00d758 = 0 + 82 + 176 + 62 + 174 = 494.\nSince we are in round 2, the discount factor 0.9 is applied, so accepting would yield 494\u00d70.9 \u2248 444.6 \u2013 which is far lower than 1011.\n\n2. If we consider making a counteroffer, we must ensure that the raw (undiscounted) value we end up with is high enough so that when discounted (0.9\u00d7 our kept amount) its value exceeds our outside offer of 1011. In fact, we\u2019d need to secure raw value of at least about 1124 (since 1124\u00d70.9 \u2248 1011.6) from the items we keep. Given that the total raw value from all items is 1332, we could only afford to \u201cgive up\u201d at most 1332\u20131124 = 208 raw value units. In designing such a counteroffer, we must also avoid giving nothing away to Player 2 (mistake 3) and not risk asking for too much, which could lead to a breakdown in negotiations. \n\n3. However, given that our current offer gives us a much lower value than our fallback and that negotiating further (with discounting and potential back-and-forth) risks not reaching a deal that beats our fallback, the safest and best option is to secure our outside offer of 1011.\n\nThus, my decision is to WALK away rather than accept the current offer or risk a counteroffer that might not be accepted.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

At round 1, gamma = 0.9 is not applied yet.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n  - My Value if Accepted:\n    - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 85 = 85\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 85 = 85\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 55 = 55\n  - **Total Value**: 85 + 85 + 94 + 55 = 319\n\n- **Comparing to Outside Offer**: \n  - 319 (current offer) < 850 (outside offer)\n\nSince the value of the current offer is less than my outside offer, accepting it would be a mistake as per Mistake 4.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n- **Accept the Current Offer?** No, because the value is lower than my outside offer.\n- **Walk Away?** This guarantees me a value of 850 from my outside offer.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?** I need to ensure the counteroffer provides a value greater than 850 to myself.\n\nLet's construct a counteroffer prioritizing my highest value items and ensuring the total exceeds 850.\n\n### Potential Counteroffer\nI gain the most value from:\n- Keeping as many units of item 4 (94 per unit) and item 1 (86 per unit).\n\n#### My Target:\n- Aim for total value **over 850**.\n- Let's try a fair but advantageous split, keeping high-value items.\n\nPropose:\n- Give Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\n**Vesting Result to Me**:\n- Keep: [3, 1, 3, 1, 2]\n  - My Total Value = (3\u00d786) + (1\u00d785) + (3\u00d785) + (1\u00d794) + (2\u00d755) = 258 + 85 + 255 + 94 + 110 = 802\n\nThis proposed value is still under my outside offer. I have to try a better combination. \n\n- How about:\n  - Give Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n\n**Vesting Result to Me**:\n- Keep: [4, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n  - My Total Value = (4\u00d786) + (1\u00d785) + (3\u00d785) + (1\u00d794) + (0\u00d755) = 344 + 85 + 255 + 94 + 0 = 778\n\nAttempting to maximize further still doesn't reach or exceed 850 without involving my higher valued item 4.

That leaves me with a retained share worth 1189 \u2212 82 = 1107 in my own valuation; discounted by 0.9 yields 1107 \u00d7 0.9 = 996.3 \u2013 safely above my outside offer of 956.\n\nThus, my counteroffer is to give Player\u00a02: 0 units of item\u202f1, 1 unit of item\u202f2, 0 units of item\u202f3, 1 unit of item\u202f4, and 1 unit of item\u202f5. This is both aggressive (securing a high retained value for me) and leaves a modest but hopefully acceptable share for Player\u00a02.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,1,0,1,1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 286. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 714 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

A deal in the later rounds will be worth less due to the discount factor, which decreases the value by 10% each round after the first.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] (I receive one unit each of item 1 and item 2)\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n     - Total value of current offer = 90 + 93 = 183\n   - Compare the value of the current offer to my outside offer: 183 is significantly less than 1014.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Should I accept the current offer? No, because 183 is much less than my outside offer of 1014.\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer immediately? No need to walk away immediately since this is the first round and there is still room for negotiation.\n   - Should I propose a specific counteroffer? Yes, I should aim for an offer where my total value is at least closer to my outside offer value to maximize my outcome.\n\nLet\u2019s consider a counteroffer:\n\nSince accepting the current offer is not beneficial, I can propose a counteroffer minimizing what I give to get as close to my outside offer value. Let's attempt to maximize our retention of high-value items.\n\nTo do this, I will consider a division that keeps a high value on my side without outrightly rejecting negotiation possibilities. I should aim to keep items that together give me a higher value. Here's a potential counteroffer:\n\n- Offer 0 units of item 1 (keeping 5)\n- Offer 0 units of item 2 (keeping 3)\n- Offer 2 units of item 3 (offering half)\n- Offer 1 unit of item 4 (offering half)\n- Offer 1 unit of item 5 (offering half)\n\nNow, calculate the retained value with the proposed counteroffer:\n- Value of 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 90 = 450\n- Value of 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n- Value of 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n- Value of 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n- Value of 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n\nTotal value with the counteroffer: 450 + 279 + 38 + 71 + 59 = 897\n\n897 is still below my outside offer of 1014, but given the discount factor, it might still develop into a workable negotiation starting point.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the following counteroffer: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1014. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1014. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 996 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In round 2, the value received is multiplied by \\(\\gamma^{(2-1)} = 0.9\\).\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - Current offer to me: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n     - Calculation for current offer:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n     - Total value = 90 + 93 + 0 + 71 + 59 = 313\n     - Discounted value = 313 \u00d7 0.9 = 281.7\n\n   - Compare to outside offer: 281.7 vs 1014\n   - Clearly, the current offer provides a value much lower than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a Decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me a value significantly lower than my outside offer, so it wouldn't be a good decision.\n   - Walking away would ensure I receive my outside offer value (1014), which is preferable to the current offer.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer: To create a counteroffer that is better than both the current offer and at least close to my outside value, I need to keep a significant portion of high-value items.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that keeps more high-value items:\n\n- My counteroffer to Player 1: [2, 2, 4, 0, 0]\n  - I keep [3, 1, 0, 2, 2]:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n  - Total value = 270 + 93 + 0 + 142 + 118 = 623\n  - Discounted value = 623 \u00d7 0.9 = 560.7\n\nGiven this analysis, any counteroffer I can make that is even remotely close to my outside value may not meet it due to the restriction of total items and discounting. It may therefore be prudent to walk away and secure my guaranteed outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

The main impact of the discount would be seen in subsequent rounds, reducing future values.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n     - Value to me if accepted would be:\n       - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n       - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 69 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 93 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 92 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n     - Total value = 87 + 31 = 118\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** Accepting this offer would give me a value of 118 which is much less than my outside offer value of 696.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer. \n   - I should not accept this offer.\n   - Walking away would give me a value of 696.

In round 2, the value is multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9, so any agreement reached now will have its value reduced by 10%.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer on the table: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n     - Value of accepting this offer: \n       - 0 units of item 1 -> 0 \u00d7 87 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 -> 0 \u00d7 69 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 3 -> 0 \u00d7 93 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 4 -> 0 \u00d7 92 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 5 -> 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n     - Total value = 31\n     - Present value considering gamma = 31 \u00d7 0.9 = 27.9, which is far worse than my outside offer of 696.\n   - Potential counteroffers:\n     - I could analyze potential divisions to maximize my value, aiming for deals that exceed my outside offer value.\n     - For example, if I propose to give Player 1: [1, 0, 1, 0, 2], I get: \n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 92 = 0\n       - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 31 = 186\n     - Total value = 684.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's evaluate the current state of the negotiation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value = 601.\n   - My values for the items are: \n     - Item 1: 80\n     - Item 2: 58\n     - Item 3: 15\n     - Item 4: 35\n     - Item 5: 10\n   - Total pool of items: 2 of Item 1, 5 of Item 2, 4 of Item 3, 2 of Item 4, 3 of Item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) affects the value of offers as the rounds progress, applying more weighting to earlier rounds as negotiations extend into later rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]:**\n     - My value from the offer: \n       - Item 1: 0 x 80 = 0\n       - Item 2: 1 x 58 = 58\n       - Item 3: 0 x 15 = 0\n       - Item 4: 0 x 35 = 0\n       - Item 5: 1 x 10 = 10\n     - Total value if I accept = 58 + 10 = 68\n\n   - **Comparison to my outside offer:**\n     - Value of 68 < Outside offer value of 601.\n\n   Given the calculations above, the value of the current offer (68) is significantly less than my outside offer (601), even when factoring potential gamma reduction later on.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer is much worse than my outside value, so accepting it would not be beneficial.\n   - Walking away stops negotiations, giving me my outside offer value of 601.\n   - A counteroffer needs to propose a division where my retained value exceeds 601 when considering the discount factor if not accepted immediately. Since it is round 1, offering a demanding counteroffer with my highest value items might be strategic, maybe aiming for value close to or beyond 601 in expectation of future counteroffers from Player 1.\n\nConsidering all of the above, the current offer doesn't benefit me when compared to the outside option. I will propose a counteroffer that aims to maximize my possible value, staying above 601 even with minor adjustments or potential acceptance. \n\n**Counteroffer strategy:**\nLet's aim to hold onto high-value items (like Item 1 and Item 2). I'll propose a counteroffer giving Player 1 minimal amounts of high-value items to maximize my retained value: [1, 2, 4, 2, 3].\n\nCalculate the retained value:\n- My kept items: [1, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n- Value: (1 x 80) + (3 x 58) + (0 x 15) + (0 x 35) + (0 x 10) = 80 + 174 = 254\n\nThis doesn't reach 601. Let's try another counterstrategy.\n\nAnother plan: I give Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], meaning I keep more items. Checking this keeps feasibility:\n- My kept items: [2, 5, 4, 2, 2]\n- Value: (2 x 80) + (5 x 58) + (4 x 15) + (2 x 35) + (2 x 10) = 160 + 290 + 60 + 70 + 20 = 600\n\nThe value gets close to my outside offer. Instead attempt another balance.\n\nAfter recalculating feasible counteroffers for optimal value above 601 or near with positional leverage focus:\n\nAttempting another feasible split, offer:\n \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 2]}\n\nThis keeps high-value items like 1 fully and most of 4 and ensures large section claim beyond original early rounds, however ensuring even near errors below threshold as a slightly multisided move adjustment fails initially again helps readjust or revamp offers in multi-matching leveraging attempts.",

Thus, if the negotiation concludes in this round, the value I receive will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]:** \n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n     - Total value = 15 + 35 = 50\n     - Discounted value for this round = 50 \u00d7 0.9 = 45\n\n   - **Compare this to my outside offer value of 601:**\n     - 45 is significantly less than my outside offer of 601. \n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Should I accept the current offer? No, because the discounted value of 45 is much less than my outside offer of 601.\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer? This is a possibility since 601 is higher than any value received so far.\n   - Should I propose a specific counteroffer? Let's try to find a counteroffer that gives more than 601.\n\n   Let's evaluate a possible counteroffer where I get maximum value:\n   - If I keep all units of items 1, 2, and 4:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n     - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 58 = 290\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n     - Initial sum = 160 + 290 + 70 = 520\n     \n   Now, balance with remaining items:\n   - If I offer Player 1, 0 units of item 3 and 0 units of item 5 and recalculate what I keep:\n     - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 15 = 60\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n     - Total value kept = 520 + 60 + 30 = 610\n\n   However, this just matches my current outside offer with no discount applied, which under the discount factor of 0.9, turns into 549. I need to ensure my counteroffer reflects this discount:\n   \n   Therefore, I am very close to being just better off walking away with my outside offer of 601 due to the discount. \n\nGiven this analysis, I should make a calculated counteroffer that gives away a little more on the low-value items, favoring the highest value items or consider walking away if not feasible.\n\nHence, I will make the decision to walk away as no combination seems plausible given the constraints to rival the outside offer due to discounts.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let\u2019s consider an alternative:\n       - Let's say I keep most of the high-value items (items 2, 3, 4, and 5) due to very high valuations.\n       - Propose offering Player 1 a division like [5, 6, 1, 1, 4]. So I keep [2, 0, 1, 1, 4].\n         - Value of my share:\n           - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n           - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n           - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n           - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 64 = 256\n         - Total value = 354 (this is to optimize my benefits but is not sufficient to surpass 1021; must redo counteroffer)\n\n3) **Decision Based on Analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer of [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] is not viable because it provides only 4 in value compared to my outside offer of 1021.\n   - I should formulate a counteroffer that optimizes high-value items for me. Let\u2019s try a more favorable division like:\n     - Offer Player 1: [5, 1, 0, 0, 4], so I keep [2, 5, 2, 2, 4].\n     - Value:\n       - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n       - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n       - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 64 = 256\n       - Total value = 794\n     - This still doesn\u2019t exceed 1021 but allocates high-value items more in my favor for negotiations to boost remaining rounds.\n\nMy action will be to counteroffer with [5, 1, 0, 0, 4].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 1, 0, 0, 4]}",

Calculating the value of what I would keep:\n\n   - Value of 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n   - Value of 0 units of Item 2: 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n   - Value of 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 79 = 237\n   - Value of 0 units of Item 4: 0 \u00d7 40 = 0\n   - Value of 0 units of Item 5: 0 \u00d7 69 = 0\n\nTotal Value: 174 + 0 + 237 = 411\n\nThe proposed offer gives me 411 value, which is still below my outside offer, but it provides Player 1 with a decent amount of diversity, potentially making it attractive to them.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 9, 1, 3, 1]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

No, because 531 is less than my outside offer of 918.\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer? Not yet, since this is only round 1 and I can propose a counteroffer.\n   - Propose a specific counteroffer? Yes, aim for an outcome better than my outside offer and fair enough to be considered by Player 1.\n\nGiven my total pool of items and values, I will make a counteroffer ensuring that I receive a value greater than 918. Let's focus on maximizing high-value items (item 4) and assess a reasonable offer by retaining more of items 1 and 4, which are of higher value to me.\n\nProposed counteroffer:\n- [1, 1, 0, 1, 4] to Player 1 (I keep [1, 1, 1, 6, 4])\n\nValue of what I keep:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n- Item 4: 6 \u00d7 77 = 462\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n\nTotal value = 62 + 69 + 25 + 462 + 144 = 762\n\nWhile this is still below my outside offer, it is a starting point for negotiation that might persuade Player 1 to make a more favorable counteroffer since I'm giving less than half of the high-value item 4, which I hope Player 1 values enough to continue negotiations rather than walk.\n\nBased on this analysis, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 4]}\n```",

However, whether it is currently optimal to wait or accept depends on the comparison with the outside offer and the value the deal brings after discounting.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer from Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 4, 4]\n     - Value for Item 1 = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n     - Value for Item 2 = 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n     - Value for Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n     - Value for Item 4 = 4 \u00d7 77 = 308\n     - Value for Item 5 = 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n     - Total value = 62 + 69 + 25 + 308 + 144 = 608\n     - Discounted value (since it's round 2): 608 \u00d7 (0.9)^1 = 547.2\n\n   - My outside offer is 918, which is higher than 547.2, the discounted value of the current offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n   - The current offer gives me a discounted value of 547.2, which is less than my outside offer of 918.\n   - Accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4) since it is worse than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away is currently more beneficial than accepting this offer.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer is an option, but it should provide more than my outside offer once the discount is applied.\n\nGiven this analysis, my best action given the current offer and its value compared to my outside offer is to WALK away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1233. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1068 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer. \n\nTo maximize my value while considering the potential negotiation dynamics, a reasonable counterproposal should be more favorable to me and closer to the middle point of the items available:\n\n#### Potential Counteroffer Calculation:\n\n- **Proposed Counteroffer**: Offering Player 1 two of the less valuable items (for me) and keeping more valuable items:\n  - Offer [1, 3, 1, 2, 1], I keep [3, 1, 3, 2, 3]\n\n  **My Value**:\n  - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 84 = 252\n  - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 40 = 40\n  - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 89 = 267\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 84 = 168\n  - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 59 = 177\n  - **Total Value**: 252 + 40 + 267 + 168 + 177 = 904\n\nAs the calculated counteroffer still provides a value below my outside offer (1233), it is a strategic move to continue negotiating without accepting an initial low-value offer.\n\nGiven these calculations, I will propose the counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My total value is the sum of (units kept \u00d7 my unit values).\n\u2022 Even a small concession that costs me little value is more than enough to beat my fallback of 78, because my full potential value (if I got everything) is 995.\n\u2022 I want to give away items that are low in value to me.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 367. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

It's best to assess the real value of the offers in this round as there is no discounting applied yet.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** The offer on the table gives me [1, 1, 2, 4, 6].\n     - Value from 1 unit of item 1: \\(1 \\times 66 = 66\\)\n     - Value from 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 96 = 96\\)\n     - Value from 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 96 = 192\\)\n     - Value from 4 units of item 4: \\(4 \\times 13 = 52\\)\n     - Value from 6 units of item 5: \\(6 \\times 57 = 342\\)\n     - Total Value = \\(66 + 96 + 192 + 52 + 342 = 748\\)\n\n   - **Comparison to My Outside Offer:** My outside offer value is 31, which is much lower than the value of the current offer (748).

In this instance, the value remains full for the first round but would be multiplied by 0.9, 0.9\u00b2 for subsequent rounds as we proceed.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer value to me:\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n\n   - Compare with outside offer value:\n     - Current offer value = 82\n     - Outside offer value = 202\n\n   Since the current offer value is less than my outside offer value, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for me than my outside offer).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   As the current offer is not satisfactory because its value (82) is less than my outside offer (202), I should not accept it. Also, since it's still round 1, we have time for further negotiation, and walking away isn't optimal. Therefore, the best course of action is to make a counteroffer.\n\nLet's create a counteroffer where my retained items are worth more than 202:\n\n   Consider offering:\n   - Keep all 2 units of item 3 since they have a high value at 72 each.\n   - Keep 3 units of item 4 also high value since they are worth 82 each.\n   - Keep 1 unit of item 2 as compromise.\n\nCalculation:\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n\nRemaining for Player 1:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis offer guarantees my value remains substantially above my outside offer (246 + 144 + 69 = 459), which is more than twice my outside offer value ensuring the discount factor effect is minimized.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 0, 1, 3]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The items I'm offered are:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 x 68 = 68\n     - 5 units of item 2 = 5 x 67 = 335\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n     - Total value = 68 + 335 = 403\n   - Since 403 > 338 (my outside offer), not accepting this offer would be a Mistake 5.\n   \n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer provides me a value of 403 which is greater than my outside offer of 338. Accepting this offer avoids Mistake 5 (walking away from a better offer than my outside option). The discount factor consideration will come into play more significantly in later rounds, but currently, the offer is already beneficial without considering further discounting.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best action for me is to accept the current offer, as it provides a higher value than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let\u2019s craft a counteroffer that benefits me significantly.\n\n   - If I keep most units with the highest value to me (especially items 5 and 1) while possibly giving more of lower value items to Player 1, I could find an optimal division.\n\n   Counteroffer strategy:\n   - Keep most units of item 1 and 5 because they're highest value\n   - Be willing to give away more of items with lower valuation to me\n\n   I will propose the following distribution:\n   - Give Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\n   Let\u2019s calculate the value for myself in this counteroffer:\n   - My items: [5, 5, 2, 3, 7]\n   - Value for myself: \n     - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 88 = 440\n     - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n     - 7 units of item 5 = 7 \u00d7 97 = 679\n   - Total Value: 440 + 300 + 112 + 126 + 679 = 1657\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of 1657, which is greater than my outside offer of 1619. This makes it a valid counteroffer and maximizes my value without exceeding my fallback option.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make the counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "My analysis is as follows:\n\n1. My outside offer guarantees me a value of 519. In the current round the deal is subject to a discount of 0.9 (since we are in round 2), so if I conclude a deal my achieved value is multiplied by 0.9. In order for any negotiation deal to beat my fallback, my undiscounted outcome value needs to be at least about 519/0.9 \u2248 577. In other words, I must secure items that (at my private values) sum to at least 577.\n\n2. The total pool of items (with my private values) is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 units at 33 each = 165\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 6 units at 31 each = 186\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 units at 3 each = 6\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 5 units at 20 each = 100\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 7 units at 20 each = 140\n\u2003\u2003Total = 597.\nIf I keep everything I\u2019d get 597, but discounted that is 597 \u00d7 0.9 = 537.3, which is above my fallback. So I can only afford to give away items with a total value of at most 597 \u2013 577 = 20 (undiscounted).\n\n3. The current offer on the table gives me [0, 1, 0, 2, 0] units. Calculating my value:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 0 \u00d7 33 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n\u2003\u2003Total = 71, and with discount 71 \u00d7 0.9 \u2248 63.9, which is far below my fallback of 519.\nThus, accepting the current offer is not acceptable.\n\n4. To secure a deal that beats my outside option, I need to keep nearly everything. I want to propose a counteroffer that gives the opponent some items (to avoid the mistake of offering nothing early) but only \u201csacrifices\u201d items that have minimal value to me. Since the available \u201ccheap\u201d items for me are item 3 (worth 3 each), I can give away both units (total cost 6). This results in me keeping:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: all 5 (value 165)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: all 6 (value 186)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 units (value 0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: all 5 (value 100)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: all 7 (value 140)\n\u2003\u2003Total kept = 165 + 186 + 0 + 100 + 140 = 591, and discounted it is 591 \u00d7 0.9 = 531.9, which exceeds my fallback.\n\n5. This counteroffer [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] does not give away more than 20 value (only 6 value is sacrificed), is strictly better for me than the fallback, and gives the opponent something (thus avoiding the mistake of offering zero). \n\nBased on the above, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 3, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 3, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, let's analyze each step.\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation**:\n   - My outside offer value is 753.\n   - My values per item and the total pool of items are:\n     - Item 1: 76, total 3 units\n     - Item 2: 65, total 6 units\n     - Item 3: 1, total 6 units\n     - Item 4: 34, total 5 units\n     - Item 5: 18, total 8 units\n   - The discount factor, gamma, is 0.9. As the negotiation process extends into further rounds, the value of any outcome is multiplied by a factor of gamma raised to the power of (r-1). So, the sooner a deal is reached, the better the outcome value.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers**:\n   - **Current Offer**: The current offer to me is [1, 3, 3, 1, 4]. \n     - My total value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 76 = 76\n       - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 65 = 195\n       - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 1 = 3\n       - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 34 = 34\n       - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 18 = 72\n     - Total value = 76 + 195 + 3 + 34 + 72 = 380\n   - My value from the current offer is 380. Since 380 is less than my outside offer value (753), accepting this offer would imply a loss of potential value.\n\n3) **Make a Decision**:\n   - Accepting the current offer would be inappropriate because it holds a value lower than my outside offer (which violates Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away is currently not advantageous unless a better offer is not possible.\n   - Considering the above information, I should make a counteroffer aiming to retain valuables items that can maximize my return above my outside offer. Hence, I must make a reasonable counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider a distribution where I improve my value:\n\n   Proposal: [1, 0, 0, 0, 3] to Player 1\n   - This means I give Player 1 the minimal required items, and I retain:\n     - 2 units of item 1 \u00d7 76 = 152\n     - 6 units of item 2 \u00d7 65 = 390\n     - 6 units of item 3 \u00d7 1 = 6\n     - 5 units of item 4 \u00d7 34 = 170\n     - 5 units of item 5 \u00d7 18 = 90\n   - New total value = 152 + 390 + 6 + 170 + 90 = 808, which is more than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the counteroffer above.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

Current situation:\n\u2003\u2022 My outside offer value is 508.\n\u2003\u2022 The full pool is: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\u2003\u2022 My per\u2010unit values are: 74, 80, 79, 90, and 56 respectively.\n\u2003\u2022 If I were to keep all items I\u2019d have a total of 1197, but I need to propose an offer that gives Player 2 enough to make an agreement attractive while ensuring my retained value is greater than 508.\n\u2003\u2022 With a discount factor of 0.9 per round (and we are in round 1 so no discount yet), settling early is beneficial.\n\n2. Offer evaluation:\n\u2003\u2022 In any division, my kept value must be at least 508.\n\u2003\u2022 For instance, if I propose giving Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1] units for items 1\u20135:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 I keep: item 1: 2\u20131 = 1 unit, item 2: 1 unit, item 3: 2 units, item 4: 6\u20132 = 4 units, item 5: 1 unit.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 My value becomes: (1\u00d774) + (1\u00d780) + (2\u00d779) + (4\u00d790) + (1\u00d756) = 74 + 80 + 158 + 360 + 56 = 728.\n\u2003\u2022 This 728 is well above my outside offer of 508, avoiding mistake 2.\n\u2003\u2022 The allocation isn\u2019t lopsided (avoiding mistakes 3 and 5) and provides a credible starting point while keeping a high value for me.\n\n3. Decision:\n\u2003\u2022 As no current offer has been proposed, and since my retained value (728) is comfortably higher than my fallback, I choose to offer [1, 1, 1, 2, 1] to Player 2 as my initial proposal.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 506. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To determine my action, I will go through the provided structured steps:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 506.\n   - My values for the items involved are:\n     - Item 1: 55\n     - Item 2: 89\n     - Item 3: 87\n     - Item 4: 32\n     - Item 5: 39\n   - The total pool of items: \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means in future rounds, the value of offers would be reduced by this factor, so it's better to consider whether current offers exceed my outside offer or should prefer to negotiate.\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer:\n   - Currently offered to me: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n   - Value of current offer:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 55 = 55\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n   - Total value if I accept the current offer = 55 + 89 + 87 + 64 + 39 = 334\n\n3) Compare this to my outside offer of 506:\n   - The current offer value (334) is less than my outside offer value (506).\n   \nConsidering these points, I should evaluate a counteroffer that maximizes my value above 506 or take my outside offer.\n\n4) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 334, less than my outside offer, which conflicts with my objectives.\n   - Walking away ensures a value of 506.\n   \nA potential counteroffer should offer higher value retained for myself than 506:\n\n   Counteroffer: [0, 0, 2, 5, 1] gives me:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n   - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n   - Total value for me = 110 + 178 + 87 + 32 + 39 = 446\n   \nThis counteroffer (446) still doesn't exceed my outside offer of 506, but it's near. Therefore, this isn't a calculation suited to maximizing my overall outcome in the negotiation within the first round, and it's likely to retain at least as much as I seek.\n\nBased on these considerations:\n- I will choose to WALK as the current offer doesn't meet my outside offer\u2019s value and there\u2019s no sufficient counteroffer available that does without invalidating due assumptions or rules.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "To decide the best course of action, I will analyze the current offer and its value to me compared to my outside offer value.\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1206.\n   - My values for the items are as follows: item 1 (93), item 2 (77), item 3 (75), item 4 (61), item 5 (45).\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 11 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor of 0.9 only influences the value if I wait for future rounds. However, since this is round 1, I will consider the immediate value of the offer to determine if it's better than my outside offer.\n\n2) Assessing the value of the current offer:\n   - The current offer to me is: [1, 1, 1, 2, 0].\n   - Calculating the value:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n   - Total value for the current offer = 93 + 77 + 75 + 122 + 0 = 367\n\n3) Decision making:\n   - The value of accepting the current offer (367) is much lower than my outside offer value (1206). Accepting this would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n   - I will propose a counteroffer that gives me a higher value while also being fair. I need the sum to be above 1206 after the discount factor for round 1 (no discount applied since it's the initial round):\n\nTo calculate possible counteroffers, let's initialy aim to receive:\n   - 2 units of item 1 (value: 2 * 93 = 186)\n   - 2 units of item 2 (value: 2 * 77 = 154)\n   - 3 units of item 3 (value: 3 * 75 = 225)\n   - 7 units of item 4 (value: 7 * 61 = 427)\n   - Total: 186 + 154 + 225 + 427 = 992\n\n   It seems difficult to reach precisely 1206 immediately. Therefore, I need to reallocate some items keeping in mind the potential values in future rounds would bring lower payoffs due to the discount factor.\n\nLet's try reaching a value closer to or above 1206:\n - Conclusion: to avoid cutting too deep into my guaranteed fallback value, I will make a conservative counteroffer.\n - Calculating a counteroffer:\n     - Let's give Player 1 a considerable but fair share.\n     - Counteroffer: [1, 0, 2, 4, 0], my result: [3, 4, 3, 7, 2, 0]\n     - Value to me: \n         - 3 \u00d7 93 (item 1) = 279\n         - 4 \u00d7 77 (item 2) = 308\n         - 3 \u00d7 75 (item 3) = 225\n         - 7 \u00d7 61 (item 4) = 427\n         - 2 \u00d7 45 (item 5) = 90\n         Total = 279 + 308 + 225 + 427 + 90 = 1329\n     - This satisfies the condition of being above 1206, given the negotiation dynamic.\n\nNow, I will make a counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 4, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

In the first round, this doesn't yet influence calculations.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   **Current offer:** [0, 0, 0, 8, 2] (offered to me)\n   - My value for this offer:\n     - Item 4: 8 units \u00d7 62 = 496\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 47 = 94\n     - Total value = 496 + 94 = 590\n\n   This offer has a total value of 590, which is less than my outside offer of 881. Accepting this would be a mistake as it is less valuable than my guaranteed fallback.\n\n   **Potential counteroffer:** Consider a distribution that could provide a higher value than my outside offer.\n\n   Let's try offering Player 1: [2, 1, 0, 4, 0] (meaning I keep the rest: [5, 2, 2, 4, 2])\n\n   - My value for the items I keep:\n     - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 73 = 365\n     - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 71 = 142\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 63 = 126\n     - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 62 = 248\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 47 = 94\n     - Total value = 365 + 142 + 126 + 248 + 94 = 975\n\n   This is above my outside offer value of 881, making it a favorable division for me.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is a mistake because its value (590) is less than my outside offer (881).\n   - Walking away is not advisable since I can propose a counteroffer with a higher value than my outside offer.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that provides me more value than my outside offer.\n\n   Given this analysis, I will make the counteroffer [2, 1, 0, 4, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 4, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 38. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 70. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Since item 2 is worth only 27 per unit for me (the lowest among my values), offering them all 5 units of item 2 means I keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 2: 5\u20135=0  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 3: 1  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 4  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 5: 1  \n\u2003\u2003My allocation value then becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u20033\u00d789 = 267  \n\u2003\u2003\u20031\u00d777 = 77  \n\u2003\u2003\u20034\u00d774 = 296  \n\u2003\u2003\u20031\u00d755 = 55  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 267 + 77 + 296 + 55 = 695 (raw value)\n\u2003\u2003Discounted value = 695\u00d70.9 = 625.5, which is much higher than 481.\n\n4. This counteroffer is better for me than accepting the current offer and is also an improvement over my previous proposal, avoiding the listed negotiation mistakes.\n\nBased on the above analysis, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,5,0,0,0]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 122. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 336 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I will aim to keep high-value items.\n\n- Let's aim for around 3 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 3 units of Item 5 which maximizes my overall value while potentially being accepted by Player 1.\n\nMy Counteroffer Calculation:\n- 1 unit of Item 1 = 77 (it means I offer Player 1 three of Item 1)\n- 0 units of Item 2 (offer Player 1 both of Item 2)\n- 0 unit of Item 3 (I take it all)\n- 1 unit of Item 4 = 30 (I take one)\n- 2 units of Item 5 = 138 (I offer three)\n- Total value to me = (3\u00d777) + (0\u00d755) + (0\u00d726) + (1\u00d730) + (2\u00d769) = 231 + 0 + 0 + 30 + 138 = 399\n\nLet's solidify the offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]}\n```\n\nThis offer keeps the value above my outside offer once adjusted for potential future round calculation and will likely elicit a more favorable response from Player 1 than the previous offer.",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 843. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 843. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For this, I need to construct an offer that ensures I attain a value above 843.\n\n   Let's construct a counteroffer:\n   - I must ensure high value items are retained.\n   - Proposed distribution: [0, 4, 1, 4, 0] to Player 1 (ensuring I get full value from the important items).\n\n   - Calculation for my retained items:\n     - Retaining 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 68 = 340\n     - Retaining 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n     - Retaining 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n     - Retaining 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 55 = 0\n     - Retaining 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n     - Total value I retain = 340 + 86 + 27 + 0 + 90 = 543\n\n   - This total retained value (543) is still significantly below my outside offer (843), indicating I need a stronger counteroffer. Let's attempt a better distribution:\n\n   Update counteroffer:\n   - Let's try keeping more high value items: [1, 5, 4, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n   - New Calculation for my retained items:\n     - Retaining 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\n     - Retaining 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n     - Retaining 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n     - Retaining 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 55 = 220\n     - Retaining 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n     - Total value I retain = 272 + 43 + 0 + 220 + 90 = 625\n\n   This is still less than my outside offer, so I cannot make this counteroffer without it being suboptimal.\n\n   Final Attempt: \n   - Full-value concentrated counteroffer: [1, 3, 4, 0, 0] to Player 1\n\n   - Final Value Calculation:\n     - Retaining 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\n     - Retaining 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n     - Retaining 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n     - Retaining 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 55 = 220\n     - Retaining 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n     - Total value I retain = 272 + 129 + 0 + 220 + 90 = 711\n\nIt appears a meaningful counter cannot exceed my outside offer given the high value I place on the single unit of item 5.

Let's propose:\n- Offer 0 units of item 1 to Player 1.\n- Offer 2 units of item 2 to Player 1.\n- Offer 4 units of item 3 to Player 1.\n- Offer 0 units of item 4 to Player 1.\n- Offer 0 units of item 5 to Player 1.\n\n#### Value for Me in This Offer:\n- Keeping 5 units of Item 1: 5 \u00d7 68 = 340\n- Keeping 4 units of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 43 = 172\n- Keeping 0 units of Item 3: 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n- Keeping 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 55 = 220\n- Keeping 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n- Total Value: \\(340 + 172 + 0 + 220 + 90 = 822\\)\n\nI'll propose creatively striking a balance above my outside offer's round value:\n- Given the round discount factor, the next round would have a discount rate of gamma^3.\n  \nFinal counteroffer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 605. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Therefore, accepting the current offer would be less beneficial than taking my outside offer.\n\n3) **Proposal and Strategy:**\n   - Since the current offer is not better than my outside offer, I should counteroffer.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that is better for me, ideally getting my value over 605.\n   - Considering my high value for items 1 and 2, I might aim to secure those, and especially focus on items 4 and 5 as well.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer where I keep more valuable items based on my value:\n   - Offer [1, 1, 3, 2, 3] to Player 1, meaning I keep:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 73 = 73\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n     - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n     - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 64 = 256\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n   - Total value with this counteroffer = 73 + 146 + 256 + 90 = 565\n\n   Unfortunately, this is still less than my outside offer. Given that we are in round 1, I should aim even higher than 605 adjusted by a slight negotiation margin to allure them.\n\n   Adjust to:\n   - Offer [2, 1, 3, 2, 4] to Player 1, meaning I keep:\n     - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 73 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n     - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n     - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 64 = 256\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n   - Total value with this new counteroffer = 146 + 256 + 45 = 447, not optimal, need to refine further.\n   \n   Finally Adjust to (Idealized Setting To Avoid Iteration Error):\n   - Offer [0, 2, 3, 3, 4] to Player 1, keeping:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n     - 1 units of item 2: 1 \u00d7 73 = 73\n     - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n   - Total value with this further optimized counteroffer = 146 + 73 + 192 + 45 = 456, still not effective.\n\n   I will aim for:\n   Keeping both units of item 1 and all three units of either item 2 or 5:\n   - Offer [0, 0, 3, 3, 4]: Optimal value recalculation.\n\n   After such convoluted endeavor and failure to exceed outside value in repeatedly alternating sets, propose basic ideal\n   - Offer [1, 2, 1, 0, 1], entailing:\n       - 1 of item 1: 73.\n       - 1 of item 2: 73.\n       - 1 of item 3: 34.\n       - 3 of item 4: 192.\n       - 4 of item 5: 180.\n       - Total Value: 554 with concessions on initially underdelivered meta.\n\n3) **Decision to Counteroffer:**\n   - Finally:\n     {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 82. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If I decide to negotiate further into future rounds, any deal I strike will be worth less because it will be multiplied by 0.9 raised to the power of (rounds - 1).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer to me is [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]. Let's calculate the total value of this offer to me:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 64 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 67 = 67\n     - Total value = 44 + 0 + 8 + 23 + 67 = 142\n   - Compare this with my outside offer value of 228. The current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer gives me 142, which is much less than my outside offer of 228. It would be a mistake to accept this offer.\n   - Walking away now, I would gain 228, which is more than the current offer.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that gives me more value than 228 (to be more beneficial than my outside offer) without compromising on making it worse for player 1.\n\nTo create a beneficial counteroffer, I will aim to keep items that are more valuable to me and make sure the total value is greater than 228.\n\nLet's try the following counteroffer:\n- I will keep all units of item 2 as it's very valuable to me, and item 5 which is also high in value.\n- Let's test a division of [1, 4, 1, 2, 0] (offering to give player 1)\n\nMy kept items would thus be:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 64 = 256\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 23 = 46\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n\nTotal value = 44 + 256 + 8 + 46 + 134 = 488, which is more than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a counteroffer {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 151. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 288 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, if we get to round 2 or 3 without an agreement, the present value of any negotiated outcome will be reduced.\n\n### 2) Assessing the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value to Me**: The offer on the table provides me:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 * 55 = 220\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 40 = 120\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n\n  Total value if I accept this offer = 220 + 120 = 340\n\n  Since 340 is less than my outside offer value of 352, accepting this offer would result in less value than taking my outside offer.\n\n- **Decision Based on Current Offer**:\n  - Accepting this offer would be less beneficial than my guaranteed outside offer. Therefore, the current offer is not acceptable as it stands.\n\n### 3) Making a Decision\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?** No, because it provides me with a value of 340, which is less than my outside option of 352.\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?** Not yet, because I still have the opportunity to negotiate a better offer that exceeds my outside value.\n\n- **Propose a Counteroffer**: I need to propose a counteroffer that would provide me with a value greater than 352. \n\nLet's consider a counteroffer:\n- Offer player 1: [1, 0, 3, 0, 2]\n- My allocation under this offer:\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 55 = 165\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 40 = 120\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 10 = 30\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 * 82 = 410\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 * 9 = 0\n\nTotal value to me = 165 + 120 + 30 + 410 = 725\n\nThis counteroffer ensures I get a value of 725, significantly greater than my outside offer of 352, and does not violate any mistake condition.\n\nTherefore, here's my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 0, 2]}\n```",

E.g., if we accept an offer in round 2, the value would be multiplied by gamma (0.9).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n     - Value to me: \n       - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 66 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 52 = 0\n       - 7 units of item 4: 7 \u00d7 5 = 35\n       - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 31 = 0\n     - Total value = 35\n   - This is significantly lower than my outside offer of 575.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Should I accept the current offer? No, because the value (35) is much lower than my outside offer (575).\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer? Not yet, because it's only the first round and there's room for negotiation to achieve a better offer.\n   - Should I propose a counteroffer?\n     - I need a counteroffer where the value to me is higher than my outside offer.\n     - Let me propose keeping the items most valuable to me: item 1, item 3, and some of item 2 and 5. \n     - So, let's say I offer Player 1: [1, 3, 3, 1, 1] - I give most of item 4 which is the least valuable to me and a portion of other items.\n     - My value for this counteroffer:\n       - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n       - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n       - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n       - 6 units of item 4 (left for me): 6 \u00d7 5 = 30\n       - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n     - Total value = 66 + 52 + 104 + 30 + 31 = 283\n\n   Unfortunately, this value is still lower than my outside offer (575). I'll modify my counteroffer to increase my outcome.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer of: [0, 2, 2, 5, 0] where I maximize the value by keeping all of item 1, item 5, most of items 2 and 3, allowing most of item 4 to Player 1.\n\n   - Value to me:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n     - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 52 = 156\n     - 2 units of item 4 (left for me): 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n   - Total value = 132 + 78 + 156 + 10 + 62 = 438\n\n   This counteroffer is still less than the outside offer, thus let me adjust once more for best possible scenario:\n\n   Another Counteroffer: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1]\n\n   - Value to me:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n     - 2 unit of item 3: 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n     - 3 units of item 4 (left for me): 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n     - 1 units of item 5: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n   - Total value = 66 + 78 + 104 + 15 + 31 = 294\n\n   Given the outside offer is 575, making another review and I\u2019ve realized it is hard to create a better offer without more information about Player 1 values leading to only valid option where max value is being same value as current still below 575 thus only valid choice is to take my outside offer instead or induce one more counter offer.\n\nFinal choice is to WALK as values not achievable combining counteroffers without knowledge of opponents max values per item:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

As Player 2 in round 2, this means if I go to round 3, and propose a counteroffer, it will end the negotiation. Thus, I should consider proposing something keeping in mind my value and possible acceptance.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer:\n- Offering [2, 1, 0, 0, 3] means I get:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n  - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n  - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 99 = 495\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n  - Total value = 1332 \n\nLet's try an offer that improves my situation but may also be acceptable to Player 1. Offering [3, 4, 1, 2, 2] results in:\n\n- I get:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n  - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 99 = 396\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n  - Total value = 782\n\n### 3) Make a decision\n\nSince the counteroffer of [3, 4, 1, 2, 2] leaves me with a value of 782, which is slightly better than my outside offer, I'll propose this counteroffer aiming to get a deal slightly above my fallback.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My analysis is as follows:\n\n1. The current offer (Player 2\u2019s proposal) gives you 3,4,1,2,2. When you calculate your raw value at your private per\u2010unit values, you get:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3\u00d725 = 75  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 4\u00d733 = 132  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 1\u00d752 = 52  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 2\u00d755 = 110  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2\u00d739 = 78  \n\u2003\u2003Total raw value = 75+132+52+110+78 = 447  \nDiscounted in round 3 (multiplier 0.81), that comes to roughly 362. This is much lower than your outside offer of 594.\n\n2. In round 3 the discount factor (0.9\u00b2 = 0.81) means any deal you agree to is \u201cdiscounted\u201d well below its raw value. Thus, you must be sure that if you try to negotiate a counteroffer, your raw value (what you keep) multiplied by 0.81 is greater than 594. That means your raw value must be at least 594 / 0.81 \u2248 734.\n\n3. Considering that the total raw available to you is 832, you can \u201csacrifice\u201d at most 832 \u2013 734 = 98 raw value for the opponent. In order to maximize your own payoff you want to give away as little as possible. For instance, offering them just one item from types where your value is low minimizes your loss in your own valuation.\n\u2003\u2003One candidate is offering them a package that, in your value terms, costs less than 98. For example, if you offer Player 2 one unit of item 2 (worth 33 to you) and one unit of item 5 (worth 39), the total \u201ccost\u201d is 33+39 = 72 in your value. This means you keep the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 5\u20131 = 4 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: all 5 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: all 3 units  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 3\u20131 = 2 units  \n\u2003\u2003Your raw value then becomes: 5\u00d725 + 4\u00d733 + 5\u00d752 + 3\u00d755 + 2\u00d739 = 125 + 132 + 260 + 165 + 78 = 760.  \n\u2003\u2003Discounted to round 3, that is 760\u00d70.81 \u2248 615.6, which is above your fallback of 594.  \n\n4. This counteroffer [0,1,0,0,1] (meaning you give Player 2 0 of item1, 1 of item2, 0 of item3, 0 of item4, and 1 of item5) maximizes your value while still providing a nonzero offer to the opponent. Although it is very \u201clean\u201d relative to previous offers in the history, it ensures that if Player 2 accepts, you get a discounted value from the agreement of approximately 615.6\u2014better than your outside alternative. If they reject (or counter in a way that ends the round) you still get your fallback 594, but you avoid locking in the current offer which is far worse for you.\n\nBased on this analysis, my decision is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "My analysis is as follows:\n\n1. Current situation:\n\u2003- My outside offer value is 802 (with no discount).\n\u2003- My per\u2010unit values are: item1 = 52, item2 = 4, item3 = 60, item4 = 93, item5 = 62.\n\u2003- The total items available are: [6, 2, 2, 6, 1] (so total undiscounted value to me is 1060).\n\u2003- Since we\u2019re in round 2, any deal reached now is discounted by a factor of 0.9 (i.e. value = 0.9 \u00d7 undiscounted value). In order for a deal to be better than my outside offer, my undiscouted share must be at least about 802/0.9 \u2248 892.\n\u2003\n2. Evaluating offers:\n\u2003- The current offer on the table (from Player 2) gives me [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]. Its undiscounted worth to me is 1\u00d752 + 3\u00d793 = 52 + 279 = 331, which when discounted gives about 297 \u2013 much worse than my 802 fallback.\n\u2003- My earlier offer in round 1 was [3, 2, 0, 0, 0] (i.e. giving opponent 3 of item1 and 2 of item2) which leaves me with a share of [3, 0, 2, 6, 1]. That yields an undiscounted value of 896 (since 3\u00d752 + 2\u00d760 + 6\u00d793 + 1\u00d762 = 896) and a discounted value of 896\u00d70.9 = 806.4, just above 802.\n\u2003- To avoid mistake 1 (making a new offer that\u2019s worse than my previous offer) and mistake 2 (proposing a split that leaves me with less than my outside offer), I must secure an offer where the total \u201ccost\u201d in my items (i.e. what I give away) is at most 1060 \u2013 896 = 164 (using my value weights).\n\u2003\n3. Designing a counteroffer:\n\u2003- To maximize my payoff I want to keep most items, but to induce Player 2 to agree I must grant them \u201cenough\u201d so that their anticipated outcome (or outside offer) seems attractive.\n\u2003- My values vary widely. I prefer not to give away high\u2010value items. Item2 is \u201ccheap\u201d (only 4 per unit) so awarding them full item2 (2 units) uses only 8 of my \u201cvalue budget.\u201d In contrast, item4 is the most \u201cexpensive\u201d for me (93 per unit) so I want to limit any concessions there.\n\u2003- My previous offer gave away 3 of item1 (3\u00d752=156) plus 2 of item2 (2\u00d74=8) for a total of 164 \u201ccost.\u201d To improve my own share and also to make the division appear enticing to Player 2 (who in his own last offer obtained a share heavy on item4), I can shift some of the concessions toward item4 while reducing what I give of item1.\n\u2003- For example, if I give Player 2 1 unit of item1 (cost 52), full 2 units of item2 (cost 8), and 1 unit of item4 (cost 93), the total cost given is 52 + 8 + 93 = 153, which is within my maximum allowed.\n\u2003- Under that counteroffer, my share becomes the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item1: 6 \u2013 1 = 5 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item2: 2 \u2013 2 = 0 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item3: 2 \u2013 0 = 2 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item4: 6 \u2013 1 = 5 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item5: 1 \u2013 0 = 1 unit\n\u2003- My total undiscounted value then is:\n\u2003\u20035\u00d752 + 0\u00d74 + 2\u00d760 + 5\u00d793 + 1\u00d762 = 260 + 0 + 120 + 465 + 62 = 907,\n\u2003\u2003and discounted value = 907 \u00d7 0.9 \u2248 816.3, which is safely above my outside offer.\n\u2003- This offer [1, 2, 0, 1, 0] (the amount I give to Player 2) is an improvement over my previous offer (giving me 907 vs 896 undiscounted) while also granting Player 2 a share that includes 1 unit of item1, full item2, and 1 unit of item4 \u2013 possibly more attractive given their earlier counteroffer.\n\u2003\nBased on this analysis, my decision is to propose the counteroffer that gives Player 2 [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,2,0,1,0]}",

However I can't get an offer above my outside offer value because of the constraint of units.\n\nDecision: WALK. Even if I try to allocate the items optimally, my outside offer remains superior.\n\nIn this situation, since I cannot construct a counteroffer that maximizes my outcome above 935, it is more logical for me to walk away and secure the offer of 935.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 551. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 912 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 184. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1335. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 843 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Thus, accepting it would be a mistake according to mistake 4.\n   - Walking away ensures I receive my outside offer value of 554.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer where I receive more value than 132, ideally more than my outside offer of 554 after considering the discount in later rounds, would be beneficial. For example, if I aim for a total value significantly above my outside offer, my proposition needs to ensure a higher value return.\n\nLet's calculate a potential counteroffer with better division:\n- If I keep most valuable items according to my preferences, while ensuring the offer value exceeds my outside fallback, let's try the following counteroffer where I propose something better for me.\n  - Counteroffer calculation:\n    - Offer player 1: [3, 2, 6, 0, 3], keeping [2, 3, 0, 3, 1] for me.\n    - Value for me:\n      - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n      - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n      - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n      - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123\n      - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n      - Total value = 30 + 267 + 123 + 9 = 429\n\nThis value if accepted in round 1 would still be lower than my outside offer, so the strategy should ensure incrementally appealing to Player 1 to negotiate further optimally in future rounds, while securing more for risk of deterioration.\n\nGiven these calculations, the current offer is less favorable at this moment, I will make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 6, 0, 3]}\n```",

This means in subsequent rounds, the value of the offer diminishes. Thus, if we reach the third round, the value of any agreement to me will be multiplied by 0.9^(2) = 0.81.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: I am offered 2 units of item 1.\n     - Value to me: 2 units * 89 = 178\n   - Accepting the current offer yields 178, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 1065.\n   - To make a comparison: \n     - I would need an offer from Player 1 with a total value to me greater than 1065 to consider accepting.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer is not an option because it is way below my outside offer.\n   - Walking away guarantees me 1065, which is better than the current offer.\n   - I can propose a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better deal. A counteroffer should aim to maximize the value I receive while leaving enough value for Player 1 to consider accepting.\n\nLet's devise a counteroffer that ensures I receive more than my outside offer value or at least enough value to consider negotiating further in subsequent rounds.\n\nOne possible counteroffer could be to give Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 5 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 2 units of item 1 (2 * 89 = 178)\n- 5 units of item 2 (5 * 25 = 125)\n- 2 units of item 3 (2 * 76 = 152)\n- 2 units of item 4 (2 * 44 = 88)\n- 2 units of item 5 (2 * 84 = 168)\n\nThe total value to me with this allocation is 178 + 125 + 152 + 88 + 168 = 711.\n\nEven this allocation doesn't reach my outside offer, but it might make it a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing some flexibility to Player 1.\n\nHowever, given the game dynamics and my strong outside offer, this counterproposal is more strategic to influence future rounds as I still prefer my outside offer.\n\nBased on these considerations, I will proceed with proposing a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

If I kept all items I\u2019d get 926.\n\u2022 The discount factor (\u03b3 = 0.9) means that any delay reduces total value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 394. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's follow the guided questions:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 394.\n   - Values of the items involved:\n     - Item 1: 45\n     - Item 2: 31\n     - Item 3: 62\n     - Item 4: 54\n     - Item 5: 63\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This affects future rounds, making an immediate higher value offer more valuable as rounds progress (due to the discounting).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (These are the units I am being offered).\n     - Value calculation if I accept:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 45 = 45\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 31 = 31\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 62 = 62\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 54 = 54\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 63 = 63\n     - Total value = 45 + 31 + 62 + 54 + 63 = 255\n     - This is less than my outside offer of 394.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** \n     - I need to propose a division that gives me a total value greater than 394.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer gives a total value of 255, which is less than my outside offer of 394. Therefore:\n     - Accepting this offer would be mistake 4.\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that would provide me more value than my outside offer:\n     - Consider keeping more of higher value items like item 3 and item 5, since they provide the highest value to me.\n     - Let's try to keep all units of items 3 and 5, while offering fewer units of items 2, 3, 4 as a counteroffer. \n\nHere's a counteroffer:\n\n- Counteroffer: [0, 2, 0, 2, 1] (I give away 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5)\n\nMy kept units:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 45 = 45\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 31 = 31\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 62 = 186\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 54 = 54\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 63 = 63\n- Total value = 45 + 31 + 186 + 54 + 63 = 379\n\nAlthough 379 is slightly less than 394 due to discount factor consideration in future rounds, making assertive offers now might ensure a better position. However, an direct value of over 394 isn't being achieved so consider pushing a bit on the middle rounds.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, as rounds progress, the value would be multiplied by lower factors. Thus, it is advantageous to reach an agreement sooner if the deal is attractive.\n\nStep 2: Assessing potential offers\n\u2022 I need to ensure my obtained value exceeds my safe fallback of 103.\n\u2022 Since my best values are from items 1, 2, and 4, I want to keep them. Items with lower value for me are item 3 (13 per unit) and especially item 5 (4 per unit).\n\u2022 A reasonable plan is to concede only low\u2010value items to Player 2 so that I give them something of potential interest while preserving nearly all of my own high\u2010value items.\n\u2022 For example, if I give away 1 unit of item 3 and all 2 units of item 5, I keep:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 5 units \u2192 5 \u00d7 81 = 405\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: (4 \u2013 1 =) 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: (2 \u2013 2 =) 0 units \u2192 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n\u2003Total kept value = 174 + 405 + 39 + 82 = 700, which is far above my fallback of 103.\n\u2022 This counteroffer avoids mistakes by:\n\u2003\u2013 Not offering no items (mistake 3) and not offering a division worse for me than my outside offer (mistake 2).\n\u2003\u2013 It leaves me with a highly attractive share.\n\nStep 3: Decision\n\u2022 I will propose an offer to Player 2 where I give them 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\u2022 This is my first move in round 1.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]}",

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's evaluate the current offer and consider any counteroffers based on the details provided:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 571.\n   - The values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 50 per unit\n     - Item 2: 51 per unit\n     - Item 3: 21 per unit\n     - Item 4: 23 per unit\n     - Item 5: 47 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is: 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor influences the value, potentially reducing the value of future rounds. However, this is round 1, so the discount does not yet apply.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   *Current Offer Evaluation:*\n   - Current offer to me is [0, 0, 1, 0, 2].\n   - My value from accepting this offer is calculated as:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 51 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 23 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n   - Total value = 21 + 94 = 115\n\n   *Comparison with Outside Offer:*\n   - The current offer value (115) is much less than my outside offer value (571).\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - Accepting the current offer yields a value (115) worse than my outside offer (571), so I shouldn't accept it.\n   - Walking away would guarantee my outside offer value (571), providing a better value than the current offer. However, it's only round 1 and counteroffers can still be made.\n   - I should make a counteroffer that is likely to maximize my value from the items, ensuring it exceeds my outside offer value (571).\n\n   *Counteroffer Strategy:*\n   - My aim is to keep as many high-value items to myself as possible to exceed my outside offer.\n   - Let's evaluate one potential counteroffer, ensuring the total value exceeds 571.\n\n   For example, I'll counteroffer by giving away: [1, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n   - My remaining allocation would be: [2, 3, 4, 1, 2]\n   - Calculating this value:\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n     - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n     - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 21 = 84\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n   - Total value = 100 + 153 + 84 + 23 + 94 = 454\n   - This does not exceed 571, let's try a slightly different combination.\n\n   A more accurate counteroffer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n   - My remaining allocation would be: [2, 4, 3, 1, 2]\n   - Calculating this value:\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n     - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 51 = 204\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n   - Total value = 100 + 204 + 63 + 23 + 94 = 484\n\nThis also does not exceed 571. Let's adjust it again for a better distribution. [0, 1, 2, 1, 0] \n\n   - My remaining allocation would be: [3, 4, 2, 1, 2]\n   - Calculating this value:\n     - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n     - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 51 = 204\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n     - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n   - Total value = 150 + 204 + 42 + 23 + 94 = 513\n\nIt still doesn\u2019t work. Instead, given the drawn-out trial process, it's possible that a maximal benefit isn't possible beyond 571 with counteroffers that are acceptable. Given the other needs to increase also, it may be sensible to simply walk, given this data construction.\n\nTherefore, I will walk away because no counteroffer was getting closer to 571 in this construction without a complete cross-examine iterating a highly tuned comb, which given previous suggested attempts seemed fruitless.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 243. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 630 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

However, future rounds would involve a 0.9 discount factor per round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer:** Player 1 has offered me [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]. Let's calculate my value for this:\n  - 2 units of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n  - 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n  - 0 units of Item 3 = 0\n  - 2 units of Item 4: 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n  - 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n  - **Total Value of Current Offer:** 78 + 82 + 38 + 65 = 263\n\n**The current offer is greater than my outside offer of 243.**\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** If proposing a counteroffer, it should have a value greater than 263 given discounts affect future rounds.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Accept the Offer:** Since the current offer gives me a total value of 263, which is greater than my outside offer value of 243, accepting it avoids the risk associated with future rounds where the discount will diminish the value progressively.\n- **Walk Away:** Not an optimal choice as the current offer is better than my fallback.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer:** Should only be considered if a better offer can be secured without substantial risk or if more rounds improve negotiation leverage.\n\n**Decision:** Accept the current offer because it provides a benefit exceeding my outside offer, aligning with mistake avoidance (Mistake 5 in particular).\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
