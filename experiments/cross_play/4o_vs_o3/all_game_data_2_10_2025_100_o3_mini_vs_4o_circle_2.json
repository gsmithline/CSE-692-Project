In the current offer from Player 2 I would have gotten [0,0,0,4,0] (i.e. all 4 units of item 4) which yields only 4\u00d711 = 44, so that deal would be very poor for me.\n\nA promising strategy is to try to keep almost all of the high\u2013value items and only concede some of the item with the lowest value to me (item 4 at 11 per unit). For example, if I offer Player 2 all 4 units of item 4, I would keep:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 3 units (3\u00d755 = 165)\n\u2003\u2003item 2: 2 units (2\u00d716 = 32)\n\u2003\u2003item 3: 3 units (3\u00d753 = 159)\n\u2003\u2003item 4: 0 units (0\u00d711 = 0)\n\u2003\u2003item 5: 4 units (4\u00d751 = 204)\nand my nominal value would be 165+32+159+0+204 = 560, which discounted gives 560\u00d70.9 = 504 (above my outside offer of 498). \n\nI can try to get a slightly better payoff by conceding even less. If I give up only 3 units of item 4 (rather than all 4), then I would keep:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 3 units (165)\n\u2003\u2003item 2: 2 units (32)\n\u2003\u2003item 3: 3 units (159)\n\u2003\u2003item 4: 1 unit (1\u00d711 = 11)\n\u2003\u2003item 5: 4 units (204)\nTotal nominal value = 165+32+159+11+204 = 571, and discounted value = 571\u00d70.9 \u2248 513.9, which is even better for me.\n\nThus, a counteroffer in which I give Player 2 only 3 units of item 4 (and nothing else) seems optimal from my perspective since it yields me a deal with a higher payoff than my outside offer, while keeping almost the entire bundle for myself.\n\nI therefore choose to make the counteroffer: offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]}",

In round 2 the discount factor is \u03b3 = 0.9 so my raw (undiscounted) value must be at least about 292/0.9 \u2248 324.4.

A division that accomplishes this is to give more of items 2 and 4 to Player\u00a02 and keep almost everything in items 1, 3, and (most of) 5. For example, if I propose giving Player\u00a02 the following quantities:\n\u2003Item1: 1 unit, Item2: 2 units, Item3: 1 unit, Item4: 4 units, Item5: 1 unit,\nthen my allocation becomes totals minus that:\n\u2003Item1: 3\u20131 = 2, Item2: 2\u20132 = 0, Item3: 4\u20131 = 3, Item4: 4\u20134 = 0, Item5: 3\u20131 = 2.\nMy raw value then is:\n\u20032\u00d7100 + 0\u00d718 + 3\u00d792 + 0\u00d722 + 2\u00d784 = 200 + 0 + 276 + 0 + 168 = 644.\nDiscounted at 0.9, that gives me 0.9\u00d7644 \u2248 579.6, which is far above 292.\n\nThis counteroffer both improves my outcome relative to the current offer and gives up mainly items (2 and 4) which I value less. (Even though Player\u00a02\u2019s private values are unknown, giving them all of items 2 and 4 should be attractive if they value them strongly.) \n\nThus, my chosen action is to counteroffer by giving Player\u00a02 the items [1, 2, 1, 4, 1].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 4, 1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 699. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 852 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

In any agreement we propose, we must ensure our share (i.e. the items we keep) are worth at least 699 to us. Since we are in round 1 (no discount yet) our full computed value is preserved.\n\nStep 2: Determine our share if we propose an offer; note that the offer gives Player 2 a certain number of units per item, and we keep the remainder:\nLet our offer be represented by a vector [a, b, c, d, e] where a is the number of units of item 1 to give to Player 2, etc.\nThen our retained amounts are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 \u2013 a\u2003\u2003Item 2: 3 \u2013 b\u2003\u2003Item 3: 3 \u2013 c\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3 \u2013 d\u2003\u2003Item 5: 5 \u2013 e\nOur own total value is:\n\u200342(5\u2013a) + 88(3\u2013b) + 65(3\u2013c) + 27(3\u2013d) + 62(5\u2013e)\nWe want this sum to be \u2265699 (our reservation).\n\nStep 3: Balancing Concession vs. Greed.\nIf we propose giving nothing (i.e. [0,0,0,0,0]) we could get 1060 value. However, Player 2 might reject an offer that gives them nothing if they have a decent outside offer. We want our offer to be \u201cjust enough\u201d for them so that they prefer agreeing to their (unknown) outside alternative.\nA natural starting point is to give them 1 unit of each item: an offer of [1,1,1,1,1].\n\nStep 4: Check our value if we use the offer [1,1,1,1,1]:\nOur retention per item:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 \u2013 1 = 4 units\u2003\u2192\u20034 \u00d7 42 = 168\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units\u2003\u2192\u20032 \u00d7 88 = 176\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units\u2003\u2192\u20032 \u00d7 65 = 130\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units\u2003\u2192\u20032 \u00d7 27 = 54\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 5 \u2013 1 = 4 units\u2003\u2192\u20034 \u00d7 62 = 248\nSumming: 168 + 176 + 130 + 54 + 248 = 776\nThis outcome gives us 776\u2014comfortably above our outside offer of 699.\n\nStep 5: Reasoning on acceptability.\nWhile we cannot know Player 2\u2019s private values, offering them 1 unit of each item gives them a nonzero share across all items. This is a modest but balanced offer which might tempt them to accept early rather than risk a delay (and discount in later rounds), while still preserving a high value (776) for ourselves. It is an aggressive opening but leaves some carrot for Player 2.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion.\nBased on these considerations, our counteroffer as Player 1 in round 1 is to offer Player 2 1 unit of each item.\n\nFinal answer in valid JSON format:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,1,1,1,1]}",

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I need to calculate the total value of the current offer for me and compare it to my outside offer value.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], meaning I keep 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. Here's how I calculate the total value of this offer to me:\n\n- Value from item 1: 4 units * 73 = 292\n- Value from item 2: 2 units * 40 = 80\n- Value from item 3: 2 units * 49 = 98\n- Value from item 4: 2 units * 61 = 122\n- Value from item 5: 4 units * 87 = 348\n\nTotal value from the offer = 292 + 80 + 98 + 122 + 348 = 940\n\nNext, I compare this total value to my outside offer value of 891. Since 940 is greater than 891, accepting would typically make sense. However, the discount rate influences the decision as well: because it\u2019s early in the negotiation and the discount factor for future rounds is not that high, negotiating further may still be worthwhile.\n\nLet's consider potential counteroffers to maximize my value, ensuring that the counteroffer gives me at least the value of my outside offer after adjustments for the round's discount factor. For round 1, we multiply by 0.9^0 = 1. Further, a counteroffer should be reasonable to ensure Player 1 might accept it or come back with something feasible.\n\nI can make a counteroffer with these considerations. I want to ensure Player 1 sees it as beneficial. Instead of giving them 1 unit of everything, let's tweak this:\n\n- I offer Player 1: [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\nThis means:\n- I keep 3 units of item 1 worth 219\n- I keep 2 units of item 2 worth 80\n- I keep 3 units of item 3 worth 147\n- I keep 2 units of item 4 worth 122\n- I keep 3 units of item 5 worth 261\n\nTotal value to me = 219 + 80 + 147 + 122 + 261 = 829\n\nSince 829 is less than 891, this current counteroffer does not meet my requirement. Let me readjust and try:\n\n- I offer Player 1: [1, 2, 0, 2, 2]\n\nThis means:\n- I keep 4 units of item 1 worth 292\n- I keep 1 item of item 2 worth 40\n- I keep 3 units of item 3 worth 147\n- I keep 1 item of item 4 worth 61\n- I keep 3 units of item 5 worth 261\n\nTotal value to me = 292 + 40 + 147 + 61 + 261 = 801\n\nThis is still unfavorable. Therefore, given the current formulat, I see 839 isn\u2019t achieved without going beyond.\n\nTherefore, given my private value of current offer exceeds my outside offer and that it's round 1, I should:\n- Accept the current offer as the overall total is acceptable, noting the strategy of maximizing value next under impulse.  \n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Here is a potential counteroffer:\n- I could receive as much of item 4 and item 3 (high-value items) as possible within reasonable trade-offs on the less valuable items.\n\n### Example Counteroffer Proposal\n\nSuppose I propose the following:\n- Give Player 1 the least valuable items from my perspective, which I am more willing to part with in separated negotiation: \n\nProposed Counteroffer to Player 1:\n- Item 1: 1 unit \n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 0 units\n- Item 4: 1 units\n- Item 5: 1 units\n\nI would receive (based on this counteroffer):\n- Item 1: 3 units = 3 * 48 = 144\n- Item 2: 0 units = 0 * 4 = 0\n- Item 3: 2 units = 2 * 88 = 176\n- Item 4: 3 units = 3 * 93 = 279\n- Item 5: 0 units = 0 * 60 = 0\n- Total = 599\n\nLet's then aim for a better counteroffer value that improves on what Player 1 may accept. I will attempt a balance, retaining high-value items.\n\nHowever, given the significant gap between my current position evaluation of 599 (previously miscalculated) and necessary viable position towards my outside offer imperative benchmark of 806:\n\nGiven that I see now still recommitted to crafting producting resolved counterfeit residual plan via altering counts,\n  \nFinal resolution from overload:\n\nI provide this adjustment plan: upon failing next step 599 baseline strategy to VARIABLY resign reduce cut down in Choice tradeoff maximization shortlist regions. \n\nIt seems not to benefit me suitably just yet fairly without precise authentic cutting leading old upper limits more comparably alternative shifting lumps not exists there broken vanilla healthier preventive revision concept continuing upon initial posited compact interpretation.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I'll try to explain my thinking. I know that in round 1 I am allowed to \u201cmake a counteroffer\u201d (i.e. propose an offer to Player 2) by specifying the amounts I would give them in each item. My own private values are very high compared to my outside offer of 18 (since my total value if I took everything would be 733). However, I must give Player\u00a02 something \u201cworth\u201d enough (from their own, unknown perspective) so they prefer to continue negotiating rather than fall back on their outside offer.\n\nBecause the opponent\u2019s private values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101, a \u201cfair\u2010looking\u201d division (one that is not extremely one\u2010sided) is likely to be acceptable. I can \u201canchor\u201d the negotiation by keeping a larger share of the most valuable items for me (especially item\u00a05, which I value at 67/unit) while shifting items that are less valuable to me (like item\u00a02, which is worth only 1/unit) over to Player\u00a02. One simple approach is to give them about half of the total items for types where I have modest value and slightly less of the ones I value very high.\n\nA nearly \u201c50\u201350\u201d division of items would be, for example, giving Player\u00a02 3 units of item\u00a01 (total 6 available), 1 unit of item\u00a02 (total 2 available), 2 units of item\u00a03 (total 5 available), 1 unit of item\u00a04 (total 2 available) and 3 units of item\u00a05 (total 7 available). That split (i.e. offer [3,1,2,1,3]) would give me the remaining items [3,1,3,1,4]. In my own evaluation that would be worth: 3\u00d720 + 1\u00d71 + 3\u00d716 + 1\u00d731 + 4\u00d767 = 60+1+48+31+268 = 408.\n\nIf I make the offer a little more favorable to me without risking immediate rejection, I could try giving a bit less of one of the high\u2010value items. For instance, I could reduce the portion of item\u00a05 that I give away. One possibility would be to offer Player\u00a02: 3 units of item\u00a01, 1 unit of item\u00a02, 2 units of item\u00a03, 1 unit of item\u00a04, and 2 units of item\u00a05 \u2013 that is, an offer of [3,1,2,1,2]. Then I would keep: [3,1,3,1,5]. My calculation becomes:\n\u2003Item\u00a01: 3\u00d720 = 60  \n\u2003Item\u00a02: 1\u00d71 = 1  \n\u2003Item\u00a03: 3\u00d716 = 48  \n\u2003Item\u00a04: 1\u00d731 = 31  \n\u2003Item\u00a05: 5\u00d767 = 335  \nTotal = 60 + 1 + 48 + 31 + 335 = 475  \nwhich is well above my outside offer of 18. \n\nI believe [3,1,2,1,2] is a reasonable initial offer that leaves me with most of my high-valued items while giving Player\u00a02 enough items so that (even though I do not know their exact preferences) it stands a fair chance of being acceptable. \n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3,1,2,1,2]}",

Given Player 1's opening offer, I should strive to balance maximizing my own value while accounting for the discount factor if negotiations extend beyond this round.\n\n   I need to consider keeping items of the highest value to me\u2014specifically items 5 and 4\u2014and my share must total more than 1035. I will try to find such a counteroffer.\n\n   - Let's assign:\n     - Keeping 0 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5 for myself.\n     - This implies offering: [7, 5, 6, 2, 0] to Player 1.\n\n4. **Calculating My Share in the Counteroffer:**\n\n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 29 = 0\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n   - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 25 = 0\n   - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 58 = 290\n   - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 100 = 500\n   - Total value = 843\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n\n   However, 843 is still less than my outside offer of 1035. I need to keep more valuable items or negotiate for more units. Let's try maximizing as follows: keeping all 5 items of the most valued item 5 to me and 6 items of another valuable item 4.\n\n   New counteroffer: [7, 6, 6, 1, 0]\n\n   My units (therefore what I'm keeping):\n   - 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n   - Total = (6 \u00d7 58) + (5 \u00d7 100) = 348 + 500 = 848\n\nEven this doesn't meet my outside offer after calculations. So essentially, making a counteroffer will not suffice unless Player 1 is willing to forfeit high valuations. Given this iteration didn't work.\n\nTherefore, as none of my reasonable counteroffers boost my value beyond 1035 substantially, I'll walk away since no currently or calculated feasible deal seems to be better than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Given the high outside offer and the fact we are in the first round, I should look for an outcome that provides a value closer to or above 223 to compensate for the risk of bargaining.\n\n3. **Counteroffer Consideration**: I need to create a counteroffer that maximizes my value above 223 while considering offering a possible fair share to Player 1.\n\n   Let's propose I keep almost all items, given my high outside offer:\n\n   - I will give Player 1: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     - This means I keep: [1, 1, 2, 1, 3]\n\n   **Value for Me**\n   - Value from 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 2 = 2\n   - Value from 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 32 = 32\n   - Value from 2 units of item 3: 2 * 36 = 72\n   - Value from 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 52 = 52\n   - Value from 3 units of item 5: 3 * 19 = 57\n\n   Total value = 2 + 32 + 72 + 52 + 57 = 215\n\nEven with this counteroffer, 215 doesn't exceed my outside option of 223, but it is at least slightly approaching my needed baseline to leverage any further negotiation potential. However, as it's still not quite there, and considering the cost of rounds (discount factor in effect), it looks better to try for something now or reconsider walking away.\n\nGiven that my counteroffer value still doesn't meet my outside offer, a continuation in this negotiation might not justify further detrimentally lowering my current position. Therefore, reconsidering the best median option might not fit within the round context. As a next step, I will avoid overextending but might finalize with the best metric established before evaluation rounds to consistently meets the outside value or transitional move.\n\nAs my offer or estimated result still doesn't approach the outside offer, substantially still leaning away from a walk zone, rebalancing the offer dynamics may hold best value without further exceeding negotiation friction. Hence, I'll be inclined for essential pragmatic flexions and adjustment determined not via repetitive dialogues.\n\n**Action:** Given the situation, I'll avoid net degradation or winding impasses and choose a guarded stance for possible better reframe:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I want to choose an offer that, if accepted, gives me a total value (from the items I keep) that is above my outside option of 547 while giving the other player enough \u201cstuff\u201d that they prefer our agreement over their own outside offer. (Note that I know my private values: item\u202f1 is 35 per unit (7 available), item\u202f2 is 74 (3 available), item\u202f3 is 100 (0 available), item\u202f4 is 5 (8 available), and item\u202f5 is 93 (2 available). If I got all items my total would be 693, so clearly there is \u201cmoney on the table\u201d for both of us.) \n\nI also know that my values differ greatly by item. In particular, items 2 and 5 are very \u201cexpensive\u201d to me (74 and 93 per unit) so I want to keep them. In contrast, item\u202f4 is only worth 5 per unit to me so I can afford\u2014if needed\u2014to give the other player nearly all of it while \u201csacrificing\u201d little of my total value. Item\u202f1 is moderately valued (35 per unit) so I might consider giving a few units to the other side if needed to help them reach a deal.\n\nA reasonable strategy is to \u201cpackage\u201d the low\u2011value items to the opponent while keeping the expensive items. For example, if I were to give away nothing except a minimal concession on item\u202f4, I\u2019d keep nearly everything and end up with about 245 (from item\u202f1) + 222 (item\u202f2) + 186 (item\u202f5) + (some from item\u202f4) \u2013 a high total. But then the opponent would get only 1 unit of item\u202f4 (worth only 5 to me, though its \u201cunknown\u201d value to them might be higher if they happen to value it highly). However, if the other player\u2019s outside offer is on average around half of their overall potential (and their items\u2019 values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101) they might very well have an outside offer in the 500\u2010range. In that case an offer giving them only a tiny piece would likely be rejected.\n\nThus I combine two ideas: I keep all of items 2 and 5 (because those are very valuable to me) and try to maximize my return on item\u202f1 by keeping most of it, but I also \u201cpay\u201d the opponent with all of item 4 (which is very cheap for me) and give them a small portion of item\u202f1. For instance, consider the following division:\n\u2003\u2022 I offer the other player 2 units of item\u202f1 (out of 7) and all 8 units of item\u202f4.\n\u2003\u2022 I keep all of items 2 and 5.\n\u2003\u2022 (Item\u202f3 is not available.) \n\nLet\u2019s check the numbers from my perspective:\n\u2003Item 1: I keep 7 \u2013 2 = 5 units, obtaining 5 \u00d7 35 = 175.\n\u2003Item 2: I keep all 3 units, obtaining 3 \u00d7 74 = 222.\n\u2003Item 3: 0.\n\u2003Item 4: I give away all 8 units, so I get 0.\n\u2003Item 5: I keep all 2 units, obtaining 2 \u00d7 93 = 186.\nMy total value if this deal is reached would be 175 + 222 + 186 = 583.\nThat is 583 (if we agree in round 1, discount factor = 1) which is comfortably above my outside offer of 547.\n\nOn the other hand, what does the other player receive? They get 2 units of item\u202f1 and all 8 units of item\u202f4. (Even though I do not know their exact values, note that many of these units come from a \u201ccheap\u201d item for me; however, they might have relatively high private values for item\u202f4 given the uniform distribution from 1 to 101. In expectation the value per unit is roughly 51 for them.

Therefore, accepting the current offer is not a good option.\n\n### Counteroffer Evaluation\n\nTo make a counteroffer that maximizes my value, I need to ensure my value exceeds 952. I can propose offering fewer or less valuable items to Player 1 in a counteroffer so that I retain more high-value items.\n\n### Suggested Counteroffer Calculation\n\nOne possible strategy might involve trying to keep as many high-value items as possible. Let's try:\n\n- **Offer to Player 1: [0, 3, 2, 2, 4]** (thus I get [1, 4, 2, 3, 1])\n\n**My Units after Offer: [1, 4, 2, 3, 1]**\n\n- **Item 1**: 1 unit \u00d7 55 value/unit = 55\n- **Item 2**: 4 units \u00d7 58 value/unit = 232\n- **Item 3**: 2 units \u00d7 35 value/unit = 70\n- **Item 4**: 3 units \u00d7 69 value/unit = 207\n- **Item 5**: 1 unit \u00d7 4 value/unit = 4\n\n**Total Value of My Units**: 55 + 232 + 70 + 207 + 4 = 568\n\nMy offer value is still less than my outside offer of 952. I need to retain more high-value items. \n\n### Revised Counteroffer\n\nAdjusting to a potential better breakdown for me:\n- **Offer to Player 1: [0, 5, 2, 1, 3]** (thus I get [1, 2, 2, 4, 2])\n\n**My New Units after Offer: [1, 2, 2, 4, 2]**\n\n- **Item 1**: 1 unit \u00d7 55 value/unit = 55\n- **Item 2**: 2 units \u00d7 58 value/unit = 116\n- **Item 3**: 2 units \u00d7 35 value/unit = 70\n- **Item 4**: 4 units \u00d7 69 value/unit = 276\n- **Item 5**: 2 units \u00d7 4 value/unit = 8\n\n**Total Revised Offer Value to Me**: 55 + 116 + 70 + 276 + 8 = 525\n\n525 is still below 952, but since this this allows further negotiation and I have several rounds left, it is a reasonable move. \n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer hoping to negotiate for a better deal in the subsequent round:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 2, 1, 3]}\n```",

Thus any deal I propose must give me a present (undiscounted, since we are in round 1) value of at least 555.\n\n2. My per\u2010unit values are highest for items 2 (80) and 1 (69), followed by items 4 (52) and 5 (41), with item 3 (15) being the least valuable. To maximize my own value while still incentivizing Player 2 to accept (so that they get an outcome they prefer over their private outside offer), I plan to offer concessions mainly on items that I value relatively low.\n\n3. In one candidate offer I can keep the full amounts of items 1 and 2, and mostly keep item 4 and 5\u2014conceding most or all of item 3 (lowest per-unit value) plus a good portion of item 4 or 5 to provide Player 2 with a \u201csufficient\u201d bundle. \n\n4. For example, if I propose to give Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 1 (I keep all 2),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 2 (I keep all 5),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 2 units of item 3 (giving away all since each unit is only 15 to me),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 4 (so that I keep 1 out of 4 units, with each unit at 52, sacrificing 156 in my value),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 4 units of item 5 (giving away all, at 4\u00d741 = 164).\n\u2003\u2003This makes my \u201cconcession\u201d from the total value:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 3: 2\u00d715 = 30,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 4: 3\u00d752 = 156,\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Item 5: 4\u00d741 = 164,\n\u2003\u2003Total concession = 30 + 156 + 164 = 350.\n\n5. My remaining value would then be: 940 \u2212 350 = 590, which is above my outside offer of 555. By keeping all of items 1 and 2 (worth 138 and 400 respectively) and 1 unit of item 4 (52), I secure 590 value.\n\n6. Although Player 2\u2019s actual valuations are unknown, giving them all of item 3 (which I value very little) along with most of item 4 and all of item 5 should give them enough to consider the deal over their external guarantee. This is a reasonable initial offer that maximizes my own payoff while offering a bundle likely to be acceptable to Player 2.\n\nThus, my action is to make a counteroffer giving Player 2 the following units by item: [0, 0, 2, 3, 4].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 3, 4]}",

I\u2019ll adjust my last offer [4, 3, 1, 1, 0] which Player 1 countered to [4, 3, 0, 1, 0]. A slight modification aiming for a total higher value is needed.\n\n   Let's consider offering Player 1: [3, 2, 0, 1, 0].\n   - My remaining items would be: \n     - Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3\n     - Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4\n     - Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n     - Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n     - Item 5: 3 - 0 = 3\n\n   - Calculate the total value for me with this new hypothetical counteroffer:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n     - Total value = 108 + 368 + 66 + 42 + 261 = 845\n\n   - Adjusted value = 845 \u00d7 0.9 = 760.5\n\n   Even though 760.5 is still less than my outside offer of 848, I need to balance between increasing the chance of a deal and improving the value. Hence, I will slightly improve my offer again to aim for more, given the constraints.\n\n3. **Best Strategy Decision**\n\nSince aiming for exact or beyond the outside offer is non-trivial, and any further counter with player manipulation may tentatively progress, considering these limitations and rational thresholds I decide to:\n\n**Walk Away**\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

In contrast, item 3 is very cheap for me (only 3 per unit) so I can afford to give all of it to Player\u00a02. I also see that while item\u00a01 isn\u2019t as cheap as item\u00a03 (37 per unit), giving it away still costs me relatively little compared with holding all of item\u00a02, item\u00a04 and item\u00a05.\n\nIf I propose giving Player\u00a02 all of item\u00a01 (6 units) and all of item\u00a03 (8 units), then my allocation will be:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 6 \u2013 6 = 0 units (I lose 6\u00d737 = 222 value),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: Keep all 5 units (5\u00d777 = 385),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 8 \u2013 8 = 0 units (losing only 8\u00d73 = 24),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: Keep all 5 units (5\u00d785 = 425),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: Keep all 4 units (4\u00d767 = 268).\n\nThat gives me a total value of 385 + 425 + 268 = 1078, which is comfortably above my outside offer of 947. On the other hand, Player\u00a02 would receive 6 units of item\u00a01 and 8 units of item\u00a03. If we assume (from symmetry) that his per\u2010unit values average around 51, his deal\u2019s value is roughly 6\u00d751 + 8\u00d751 = 14\u00d751 \u2248 714\u2014a value that is around the average of what his outside offer might be. \n\nThus, by offering a deal that gives him items on which I have little marginal gain while keeping my high\u2010value items, I both secure a better than outside option deal for myself and offer Player\u00a02 a roughly competitive alternative. \n\nBased on this reasoning, my initial offer is to give Player\u00a02 all 6 units of item\u00a01 and all 8 units of item\u00a03.

Instead, I should propose a counteroffer that increases my potential gain.\n\nThe goal of my counteroffer is to ensure I exceed the 720 threshold after accounting for the discount, maximizing my value preference. \n\nLet's construct a counteroffer where I propose to split the items in a way that maximizes my value:\n\n- I aim to keep all units of item 3 and as many as possible of items with high value to me while making a plausible offer for Player 1.\n\nTo achieve at least a value of 720, keeping items with the highest value to me while still trying to reach a compromise:\n\n- I should keep 3 of item 3 primarily, have a gain influence on item 1 by keeping at least 3, and item 5.\n\nI need to test and adjust so that even with a potential discount, the value I adjust here can step over the unreazolled figure with adjustment. Here is an example counteroffer:\n\n- For item 1, I offer 1 to player 1 (I keep 2)\n- For item 2, I offer 1 to player 1 (I take 1)\n- Keeping all of item 3 (offering none)\n- Offering all of item 4 (since very minimal value to me)\n- Offering 3 item 5 (trying to evaluate if any better optimal balance can be achieved)\n\nLet's assess the offer: \n- My kept items: \n  - 2 units of item 1: \\(2 \\times 42 = 84\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 30 = 30\\)\n  - 3 units of item 3: \\(3 \\times 100 = 300\\)\n  - 0 unit of item 4: \\(0\\)\n  - 3 units of item 5: \\(3 \\times 53 = 159\\)\n- Total value: \\(84 + 30 + 300 + 0 + 159 = 573\\)\n\nAdjusting for the discount factor if answered immediately (value will adjusted to game round situation.): \n- Since the anticipation of complextional phase may not allow all units being timely acquired due to potential adjustements, I'll trail for another test value overlay.\n\nMy final counteroffer will aim to be practical fitting within the negotiation reach while trying to help persuade effectiveness.

                    "response": "I will choose to propose a counteroffer. My reasoning is as follows:\n\nI know that if no negotiated deal is reached I get my outside offer guaranteed at 375 (with no discount in round 1). Thus, any deal I propose must give me (using my private values) at least 375. My total full\u2010value (if I got all items) would have been 478. That means I can \u201csacrifice\u201d at most 478 \u2013 375 = 103 points of my value in order to entice Player 2. In considering which items to \u201cgive up,\u201d I note that from my perspective the per\u2010unit values are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: 57 (highest)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: 40\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 18\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 6\u2003\u2003(lowest)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: 22\n\nTo maximize my own eventual value, it makes sense to keep all of the items on which I have the highest value (items 1 and 2) and also to keep as many as possible of item 5. (I do care about item 5 but its 22 per unit is not as \u201cprecious\u201d as items 1 and 2.) Therefore, to build an offer attractive enough to Player 2 while losing no more than 103 total \u201cpoints\u201d (by my measure) I look to the items on which my unit value is low \u2013 namely, items 3 and 4.\n\nIn my offer I can \u201cgive\u201d all of item 3 and item 4. Their total available quantities are 4 and 3 respectively. The cost to me would be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 3: 4 \u00d7 18 = 72\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 4: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\nTotal cost = 72 + 18 = 90, which is within my maximum \u201csacrifice\u201d of 103. This leaves me with the remaining items:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 1: all 2 units (2\u00d757 = 114)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 2: all 3 units (3\u00d740 = 120)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item 5: all 7 units (7\u00d722 = 154)\nMy retained total value = 114 + 120 + 154 = 388, which is above my outside offer of 375.\n\nNow, from Player 2\u2019s perspective (although their private values are unknown, they are drawn uniformly so the average expected per\u2011unit value is about 51), the offer gives them 7 \u201cunits\u201d (4 units of item 3 and 3 units of item 4). Their expected total (if we assume an average of about 51 per unit) would be roughly 7\u00d751 = 357. Although this expected number might be a bit below a median outside offer for them, player 2\u2019s true draw on their private outside offer could well be lower. (And if they reject the deal they get their own outside offer\u2014but then the discount in later rounds would hurt them.) \n\nThus, by offering Player 2 all of items 3 and 4 (and nothing from items 1, 2, or 5), I keep a deal that for me is worth 388 (better than my fallback 375) while giving Player 2 a bundle of 7 units that might be acceptable if their own outside offer is not very high. \n\nTherefore, my action is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 3, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 930. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I want to choose an offer that gives me a deal with a present\u2010value above my outside offer of 930 but \u201csurrenders\u201d only a modest amount of high\u2010value items so that my eventual \u201ctake\u2010home\u201d is high. I have value per unit as follows:\n\n \u2022\u2003Item 1: 41 (2 units)\n \u2022\u2003Item 2: 38 (3 units)\n \u2022\u2003Item 3: 25 (6 units)\n \u2022\u2003Item 4: 64 (6 units)\n \u2022\u2003Item 5: 68 (8 units)\n\nIf I were to keep everything I\u2019d end up with 1274 in value; however, my outside offer guarantees me 930. In a negotiation I want the deal (if reached) to be better than my fallback and also \u201csweeten\u201d the deal enough for Player 2 to consider accepting. I don\u2019t know Player 2\u2019s exact numbers, but if we assume their values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 the typical (expected) per\u2010unit value is about 51. In order to help Player 2 see some value in our deal, I need to leave them a bundle that is \u201cworth\u201d (to them) a reasonable amount relative to what they might get on their own.\n\nI plan to secure most of the items on which I have high value \u2013 notably items 4 and 5 \u2013 while giving away items on which my own value is lower, so that I lose little even if Player 2 values them more highly. Item 3 is my \u201ccheap\u201d item (worth only 25 to me), so giving it away is a low cost for me. If I give away all 6 units of item 3 I sacrifice 6\u00d725 = 150 points of my value. That would leave me with 1274 \u2013 150 = 1124, which is well above my outside offer of 930.\n\nSometimes a minimal concession (giving only item 3) might not be enticing enough for Player 2. I might add one extra unit of another \u201ccheaper\u201d item. Among the remaining items, item 2 (38 per unit) is modest and has 3 units total. If I give away one unit of item 2 as well, I lose another 38 points but still keep 2 units (76 points from item 2). Recalculating my kept value:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: I keep all 2 units: 2\u00d741 = 82\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: I keep 2 of 3: 2\u00d738 = 76\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: I keep 0 of 6: 0\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 (we give all 6 away)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: I keep all 6: 6\u00d764 = 384\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: I keep all 8: 8\u00d768 = 544\n\nTotal = 82 + 76 + 384 + 544 = 1086. This outcome is above my 930 fallback.\n\nAt the same time, Player 2\u2019s bundle (which is the offer I\u2019m making to them) is:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 0\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 1 unit \n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: all 6 units\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 0\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 0\n\nIf their values are around 51 per unit on average, then they get roughly:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: ~51\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 6\u00d751 \u2248 306 \nTotal \u2248 357, which (while modest) is an improved \u201cpackage\u201d over receiving nothing immediately. (Player 2 may think differently based on their private numbers, but it\u2019s a reasonable starting offer.)\n\nThus, as my round\u20111 move I propose offering Player 2 the bundle [0 (item1), 1 (item2), 6 (item3), 0 (item4), 0 (item5)], which gives me an outcome worth 1086 \u2013 safely above my fallback and concedes items that are less \u201cprecious\u201d to me.\n\nMy action is:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 6, 0, 0]}",

Hence, accepting this offer would not be beneficial, as it provides much less value than simply walking away and taking the outside offer.\n\n**Counteroffer Consideration:**\nI need to create a counteroffer that exceeds the value of my outside offer when considering the discount factor (gamma = 0.9 in round 1 has no effect as it is 0.9^0 = 1).\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer aiming for a total value above 561. I should focus on maximizing units of higher value items (items 4 and 5 specifically, due to their high values).\n\n**Possible Counteroffer:**\nLet's attempt to keep most of items 4 and 5:\n- Give Player 1: [0, 0, 6, 1, 4]\n  - This means I keep: [2, 3, 0, 5, 4]\n\nChecking the value of what I would keep:\n- Value from item 1: 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n- Value from item 2: 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n- Value from item 3: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- Value from item 4: 5 \u00d7 67 = 335\n- Value from item 5: 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n\nTotal value I would receive = 78 + 117 + 0 + 335 + 248 = 778\n\nThis counteroffer provides a value of 778, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 561.

I should only accept offers that exceed my outside offer value after considering any potential discount in future rounds. As this is round 2 and if I offer a counteroffer without reaching an agreement, this offer would be my best bet.\n\nNow let\u2019s generate a counteroffer that could potentially offer me better value than the original:\nGiven that Player 1 is sticking to their proposal of [0, 1, 6, 0, 0], they seem inclined to take item 3, and offered no units of items 1, 4, or 5. My previous counteroffer was [0, 0, 6, 1, 4], which suggests I kept most valuable items to myself.\n\nI will counteroffer as follows:\n- I will assert control over items with higher value to maximize my potential returns, given that item's total value doesn't overwrite my outside offer potential. \n- I propose [0, 0, 6, 1, 3] reducing item 5 from their offer further.\nWith the counteroffer, I would retain:\n- Value for 2 units of item 1: 2 * 39 = 78\n- Value for 3 units of item 2: 2 * 39 = 78\n- Value for 0 units of item 3: 0 * 3 = 0\n- Value for 5 units of item 4: 5 * 67 = 335\n- Value for 5 units of item 5: 5 * 62 = 310\n\nTotal value is 78 + 78 + 0 + 335 + 310 = 801, which after factoring in gamma discount to (r-1) where r=2 becomes 0.9 * 801 = 721.\n\nThis valued more than my outside offer (561), and is preferable than walking.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 620. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 0, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 0, 0, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I would receive:\n\n- 0 units of item 1: \\(0 \\times 75 = 0\\)\n- 3 units of item 2: \\(3 \\times 68 = 204\\)\n- 10 units of item 3: \\(10 \\times 3 = 30\\)\n- 0 units of item 4: \\(0 \\times 45 = 0\\)\n- 0 units of item 5: \\(0 \\times 27 = 0\\)\n\nTotal value of this offer = 0 + 204 + 30 + 0 + 0 = 234\n\nMy outside offer is 620. Clearly, this offer isn't better than my outside offer, so I will not accept this.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy:\nI need to negotiate a division that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 620.\n\n#### Calculation for Maximum Self-Benefit:\n\n1. Items 1 and 2 are highly valuable to me.\n2. Items 3 is of low value to me, whereas items 4 and 5 have moderate value.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value.\n\n#### Counteroffer:\n\nSuppose I offer Player 1:\n- 3 units of item 1: \\(2 \\times 75 = 150\\)\n- 1 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 68 = 136\\)\n- 8 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\)\n- 0 units of item 4: \\(0 \\times 45 = 0\\)\n- 0 units of item 5: \\(0 \\times 27 = 0\\)\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 2 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 75 = 225\\)\n- 2 units of item 2: \\(1 \\times 68 = 68\\)\n- 2 units of item 3: \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\)\n- 3 units of item 4: \\(3 \\times 45 = 135\\)\n- 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 27 = 54\\)\n\nTotal value for my side = 225 + 68 + 24 + 135 + 54 = 506\n\nCurrent value (taking into account the gamma adjustment) is \\(506 \\times 1 = 506\\), still less than the outside option.\n\n\nGiven these considerations, I need to make a concession and make a more favorable counteroffer slightly to ensure I get a deal above 620.\n\n#### Adjusted Counteroffer:\nLet's refine the counteroffer to ensure it gives me good leverage beyond my outside offer:\n\nOffer Player 1:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 7 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThus, I propose the counteroffer:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 7, 1, 1]}",

This means the current offer isn't preferable compared to my outside offer.\n\n**Possible Action Considerations:**\n- **ACCEPT**: Accepting the current offer would yield a value of 567 discounted by gamma (since it's the second round), but because 567 (discounted or not) is less than 620, accepting is suboptimal.\n- **WALK**: Walking means I secure the value of my outside offer, which is 620.\n- **COUNTEROFFER**: I can make a counteroffer that potentially exceeds the value I get from walking. For this, I need a configuration that gives me a higher total value than 620 when adjusted for gamma.\n\nSince I need to maximize my outcome value with the current round's offer being directly less than my outside offer:\n\n1. Let's explore offering [2, 1, 5, 1, 1] to Player 1:\n   - I keep: 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n   - Calculating value for keeping these:\n     * Item 1: 3 units * 75 = 225\n     * Item 2: 2 units * 68 = 136\n     * Item 3: 5 units * 3 = 15\n     * Item 4: 2 units * 45 = 90\n     * Item 5: 1 unit * 27 = 27\n   - Total value held = 225 + 136 + 15 + 90 + 27 = 493\n\n2.

This means they are offering me nothing and expecting to keep all the items.\n   - The current offer value to me is 0 because I'm not getting any items from this offer. Clearly, this is not acceptable given that my outside offer value is 227.\n\n2. **Considering Alternatives:**\n   - **ACCEPT:** Accepting the current offer would yield a total value of 0. This is far less than my outside offer value of 227.\n   - **WALK:** Walking away would guarantee me my outside offer value of 227.\n   - **COUNTEROFFER:** I need to propose a counteroffer that provides me more value than my outside offer value of 227.\n\n3. **Formulating a Counteroffer:**  \n   Since my total possible value from all items is 444, any offer that gives me more than my outside offer of 227 is theoretically acceptable. Let's attempt a balanced counteroffer:\n\n   - Total items available: [3, 3, 2, 4, 2]  \n   - My proposed division of items: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]  (I will offer [2, 1, 1, 2, 1] to Player 1).\n\n   **Calculating the Value of My Proposal:**\n   - Items for me:  \n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 18 = 18  \n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6  \n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 51 = 51  \n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62  \n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 73 = 73  \n   \n   - Total value = 18 + 18 + 51 + 62 + 73 = 202\n\n   This proposal gives me a value of 202, which is still below my outside offer of 227. However, if I attempt to ask for more items, it might not be a balanced offer and may lead to rejection.\n\nGiven the constraints and previous offer contexts, there's room for another counteroffer in this round to see if more favorable terms can be reached before potentially walking away. However, ensure counteroffers in future rounds would not lead to an unsatisfactory resolution, walking away remains a secure position given the significant difference between calculated potential gains and the overestimated outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I'll propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 722. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 5, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's evaluate the current offer and see if it meets or exceeds the value of my outside offer, which is 722.\n\n**Current Offer Assessment:**\n- Items offered to me: [0, 0, 5, 0, 5]. This means I'm being offered 5 units of item 3 and 5 units of item 5.\n\n**Value Calculation:**\n1. Item 1: 0 units * 46 value/unit = 0\n2. Item 2: 0 units * 45 value/unit = 0\n3. Item 3: 5 units * 2 value/unit = 10\n4. Item 4: 0 units * 13 value/unit = 0\n5. Item 5: 5 units * 94 value/unit = 470\n\nTotal value of offer = 0 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 470 = 480\n\nMy outside offer is 722, which is greater than 480. Hence, accepting the current offer is not beneficial compared to my outside offer.\n\n**Counteroffer Consideration:**\n- Let's aim to get a total value greater than 722 when considering the discount factor since it's round 1 and the discount factor is not yet applied.\n\nI need to keep certain units so that my counteroffer yields a value greater than my outside option of 722:\n\n- Let's try to maximize high-value items:\n  - If I keep all 5 units of item 5, its value is 470.\n  - I need to achieve at least 252 more (as 722 - 470 = 252).\n\n- I can achieve this by deciding cleverly how to split the rest of the items:\n  - Let's focus on items 1 and 2 as they have significant individual values.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer:\n\n**Counteroffer:**\n- Offer player 1:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit (keeping 2 units myself - value: 2 * 46 = 92)\n  - Item 2: 3 units (keeping 2 units myself - value: 2 * 45 = 90)\n  - Item 3: 5 units (keeping 0 units myself - value: 0)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (keeping 0 units myself - value: 0)\n  - Item 5: 0 units (keeping 5 units myself - value: 5 * 94 = 470)\n\n**Total value to me:** 92 + 90 + 470 = 652\n\nStill not favorable since this calculation shows a total below 722. Let's optimize further by keeping another unit of a high-value item:\n\n- Offer player 1:\n  - Item 1: 0 units (keeping 3 units myself - value: 3 * 46 = 138)\n  - Item 2: 3 units (keeping 2 units myself - value: 2 * 45 = 90)\n  - Item 3: 5 units (keeping 0 units myself - value: 0)\n  - Item 4: 2 units (keeping 0 units myself - value: 0)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit (keeping 4 units myself - value: 4 * 94 = 376)\n\n**New total value to me:** 138 + 90 + 376 = 604\n\nMy strategy requires value recalibration; current setups fall short of outside option security. I must concern allocation precision in my offer against value expectations:\n\nLet\u2019s make a counteroffer that considers precise balancing to outdo 722:\n\n- Offer player 1:\n  - Item 1: 0 units (keeping 3 units)\n  - Item 2: 2 units (keeping 3 units)\n  - Item 3: 2 units (keeping 3 units)\n  - Item 4: 0 units (keeping 2 units)\n  - Item 5: 1 unit (keeping 4 units)\n\nRe-evaluation:\n\n- If I keep 4 of item 5 = 376.\n- If I keep 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 13 = 26\n- If I keep 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 46 = 138\n- If I keep 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 45 = 135\n- If I keep 3 units of item 3 = 3 * 2 = 6\n\n**New total value to me = 376 + 26 + 138 + 135 + 6 = 681**\n\nWhile mathematically modeling the proposal set to meet marked goals: keep high gross items constructively.

I\u2019m choosing item types that cost me less so that I keep a high total (994) while hopefully offering Player 2 something that, from his perspective, is competitive with his outside option. (Note that although my numbers and his private values differ, offering lower\u2010valued items for me may be viewed as an attractive concession to him if his valuations are typical.) \n\nThus, my counteroffer is to give Player 2: \n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 1,\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 2,\n\u2003\u2022 4 units of item 3,\n\u2003\u2022 3 units of item 4,\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 5.\n\nThis is expressed in the required format as follows.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 3, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 194. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 369 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The current value (27.54) from the offer on the table is considerably less than my outside offer (194).

To justify a deal, I must get an outcome whose value (using my personal item values) is at least 429.\n3.

Since I want to capture as high a value as possible (ideally above my outside offer) while giving the other player a chance to accept, my idea is to concede low\u2013value units (to me) and keep high\u2013value items.\n5. One natural idea is to \u201cgive away\u201d the lower\u2013value items (like item 4 and parts of item 2) because they detract less from my total value.\n6.

My counteroffer, then, is to offer Player 2 these quantities:\n\u2003\u2003[0, 3, 0, 6, 0].\n\nThis division gives me a present\u2013value of 448 (with discount factor 1 in round 1) while offering Player 2 the lower\u2013value items.

The current offer value (316) is less than the outside offer.\n   \n4. **Discount Factor Consideration:** Even with a discount factor of 0.9 in play, the value diminishes with each round but still:\n   - The current round value after discount = 316 \u00d7 0.9^0 = 316 (no discount applicable for round 1 offer).\n\nSince accepting this offer gives me a value (316) that is far less than walking away (590), accepting the current offer is not an option. I should attempt a counteroffer that maximizes my value above my outside offer. \n\n5. **Constructing a Counteroffer:**\n   - To get a value higher than 590, considering I have high values for item 2 and 5, let's keep all units of these valuable items.\n   - I will make a counteroffer where I keep all items of 2 and 5 for myself.\n\nCounteroffer:\n- Give player 1 zero units of items 2 and 5, and all remaining units of 1, 3, and 4 (6 units of item 1 if I take 3, 1 unit of item 3, and 4 units of item 4). Their needs likely involve high-value items.\n\nThis new division would be:\n- {0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, meaning I keep all items for myself to maximize my share due to the high outside offer. Or emphasize the most value-heavy units and try negotiations in further rounds if possible for a better offer.\n\nTaking these into account, my decision here is to counteroffer:\n- A distribution enabling a theoretical negotiation tweak where I propose I get all high-value items. Critical aim: maximize flexibility for an impactful counteroffer shift for subsequent rounds.\n\nLet's settle on a theoretical reduction in hard items and potentially adjust in pragmatic offer reception:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 1, 4, 0]}",

Looking at my private values, I value item\u00a05 the most (85 each) and item\u00a03 next (73 each) while item\u00a01 is the lowest (30 each). A good strategy is to keep the items I value more and concede the ones I care about less.

In our negotiation protocol the counteroffer is given as the list of items I give to Player\u00a02. So I would propose to give Player\u00a02 all 9 of item\u00a01 and nothing of the others, i.e. an offer of [9, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nThus, my counteroffer gives me a share of [9\u20139, 3\u20130, 1\u20130, 4\u20130, 3\u20130] = [0, 3, 1, 4, 3] with total value 576 (before discount) and 518.4 after discount. This outcome beats my outside offer and is as beneficial as possible from my perspective while still being potentially attractive to Player\u00a02 (especially since I am conceding the item I value least).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [9, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

Recall the quantities:\n\u2022 Item 1: 3 units (value 35 each)\n\u2022 Item 2: 6 units (value 53 each)\n\u2022 Item 3: 3 units (value 48 each)\n\u2022 Item 4: 1 unit  (value 77)\n\u2022 Item 5: 4 units (value 8 each)\n\nThe total value if I got everything would be 676.

My private values for the items are:\n\n\u2003Item 1: 48\u2003\u2013 total available: 4  \n\u2003Item 2: 36\u2003\u2013 total available: 6  \n\u2003Item 3: 9\u2003\u2003\u2013 total available: 7  \n\u2003Item 4: 100\u2003\u2013 total available: 6  \n\u2003Item 5: 79\u2003\u2013 total available: 2  \n\nIf I kept everything my value would be 1229 (confirmed). But that would leave Player 2 nothing, and they are very unlikely to accept zero if their outside offer (unknown to me but at least nonzero) is available to them.\n\nI note that item 3 is very \u201ccheap\u201d for me (only 9 per unit) compared to the high values I place on items 1, 4, and 5. Even item 2 is only 36 per unit. So I can afford to concede items that I value relatively less while keeping almost all of the high\u2010value items.\n\nOne simple idea is to give Player 2 all of item 3 (7 units). That means I would keep:\n\u2003Item 1: all 4 (value = 4\u00d748 = 192)  \n\u2003Item 2: all 6 (value = 6\u00d736 = 216)  \n\u2003Item 3: 0 (value = 0)  \n\u2003Item 4: all 6 (value = 6\u00d7100 = 600)  \n\u2003Item 5: all 2 (value = 2\u00d779 = 158)  \nTotal = 192 + 216 + 600 + 158 = 1166, which is above my outside offer of 1075.\n\nHowever, giving player 2 only item 3 might be too stingy if\u2014on average\u2014their valuation for item 3 is around 50 per unit (while mine is 9). Their overall value in that bundle could be around 350, which might be below what their own alternative could be. To try to make the offer slightly more attractive, I can give them a small additional concession from an item I value a bit less (like one unit of item 2). Then the offer to Player 2 becomes:\n\u2003Item 1: 0 units  \n\u2003Item 2: 1 unit  \n\u2003Item 3: 7 units  \n\u2003Item 4: 0 units  \n\u2003Item 5: 0 units\n\nWith this, I keep:\n\u2003Item 1: 4 units (192)  \n\u2003Item 2: 5 units (180)  \n\u2003Item 3: 0 units  \n\u2003Item 4: 6 units (600)  \n\u2003Item 5: 2 units (158)  \nTotal = 192 + 180 + 600 + 158 = 1130 > 1075\n\nPlayer 2 now gets item 2 (1 unit) plus all of item 3 (7 units). Even if on average their per\u2010unit values might be higher than mine, the bundle is modest but might be acceptable in a first round when time discounting is minimal. I am offering just enough to provide an incentive to accept a deal rather than walking away for their outside offer.\n\nI will therefore propose the initial offer as:\n\u2003Offer to Player 2: [0, 1, 7, 0, 0]\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,1,7,0,0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, accepting a worse offer isn't viable.\n\nGiven that it's round 1, I will adjust my counteroffer to keep 4 units of item 5, since it is the most valuable to me.\n\n**Revised Counteroffer**: [2, 0, 2, 3, 2] (Give away)\n  - I keep: [4, 3, 1, 0, 4]\n\n**Calculate new value**:\n- Keeping 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 23 = 92\n- Keeping 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n- Keeping 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n- Keeping 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n- Keeping 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 81 = 324\n- Total value I keep: 92 + 204 + 17 + 0 + 324 = 637\n\nThe new offer with a value of 637 exceeds the outside offer of 425, even with the discount applied.

For example, if I give Player 2 all of the units of items 1 (9) and 2 (5), then I would keep all of items 3, 4, and 5. My value for the deal would then be computed as:\n\n\u2003\u2022 item 3: 7 \u00d7 35 = 245  \n\u2003\u2022 item 4: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60  \n\u2003\u2022 item 5: 5 \u00d7 48 = 240  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 245 + 60 + 240 = 545\n\nSince 545 is well above my reservation (outside) value of 207 (and we are still in round 1 with no discounting yet), this offer guarantees me a very favorable outcome if accepted. Although I do not know Player 2\u2019s private values, offering them all of items 1 and 2 (which yield a low value of 45 and 80 respectively to me) may be sufficiently tempting to induce acceptance while leaving me with the items I value most.\n\nThus, my initial counteroffer will be to give Player 2 all of items 1 and 2, and keep all of items 3, 4, and 5 for myself.

Let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n\n- Value of item 1: 9 units \u00d7 6 = 54\n- Value of item 2: 4 units \u00d7 56 = 224\n- Value of item 3: 3 units \u00d7 15 = 45\n- Value of item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 19 = 19\n- Value of item 5: 4 units \u00d7 68 = 272\n\nTotal value of the current offer to me = 54 + 224 + 45 + 19 + 272 = 614\n\n### Discounted Value of Current Offer\nSince it is round 2, the discount factor is applied:  \nValue adjusted for discount = 614 \u00d7 0.9 = 552.6\n\n### Comparison with Outside Offer\n- Current offer adjusted with discount: 552.6\n- My outside offer value: 634\n\n### Conclusion\nThe discounted value of the current offer (552.6) is less than my outside offer value (634). Therefore, accepting the current offer is not better than walking away and taking my outside offer. I should make a counteroffer that increases my value.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\nI need to construct an offer that maximizes my value exceeding my outside offer. One strategy is to prioritize items with higher value per unit to me:\n\nLet's propose I give Player 1 the following, focusing on retaining more units of item 2 and item 5, which have the highest value to me:\n- Item 1: Give all 9 to get some items of higher value.\n- Item 2: Retain 3 (give 2), as it's very valuable.\n- Item 3: Retain 4 (give 3).\n- Item 4: Retain both units as they are valuable compared to their small count.\n- Item 5: Retain 3 (give 2).\n\nMy counteroffer would be for Player 1 to receive [9, 2, 3, 0, 2]:\n\nNow, let\u2019s calculate the value to me:\n- Value of item 1 retained = 0 units \u00d7 6 = 0\n- Value of item 2 retained = 3 units \u00d7 56 = 168\n- Value of item 3 retained = 4 units \u00d7 15 = 60\n- Value of item 4 retained = 2 units \u00d7 19 = 38\n- Value of item 5 retained = 3 units \u00d7 68 = 204\n\nTotal value of counteroffer to me = 0 + 168 + 60 + 38 + 204 = 470\n\nThe discounted value of my counteroffer = 470 \u00d7 0.9 = 423\n\nAlthough this does not surpass my outside offer, it\u2019s worth negotiating further unless Player 1 accepts to increase my share.\n\nReturning this counteroffer maintains a potential strategy while keeping the option to walk later if needed. However, since this is already round 2, walking could also be considered better if no better offer can be expected.\n\nGiven the urgency of maximizing the value, walking might indeed be preferable if no deal can yield more than the outside value.

A delay could reduce the present value of the outcome (discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9 per round after the first).\n\nStep 4: To improve the likelihood of immediate agreement in round 1 (which avoids discounting), I can concede a little bit on items that I value even more\u2014without sacrificing too much of my own total outcome. In my estimation, giving up one unit of item 2 (worth 80 to me) is a modest concession if it helps secure a deal quickly. Then my kept items become:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 1 unit at 79\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 5 units at 5\u00d780 = 400\nTotal kept value = 79 + 400 = 479, which is still comfortably above 403.\nAt the same time, player2 receives:\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 2 plus all of items 3, 4, and 5 (i.e.  [0, 1, 4, 3, 4]),\nwhich should be attractive enough given they also have an outside offer that\u2019s privately drawn but is likely lower than what they could get from a full division of items (and if they value items 3\u20135 around the average, they could see solid value here).\n\nStep 5: Hence, offering [0, 1, 4, 3, 4] means I propose to give player2:\n\u2003\u2022 0 of item 1,\n\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item 2,\n\u2003\u2022 all 4 units of item 3,\n\u2003\u2022 all 3 units of item 4,\n\u2003\u2022 all 4 units of item 5.\nI keep:\n\u2003\u2022 item 1 fully and 5 units of item 2,\ntotaling 479 in my valuation. This is above my outside offer, and it offers a meaningful bundle for player2 that might reduce delay.\n\nThus, my chosen action is to make a counteroffer with offer [0, 1, 4, 3, 4].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 4, 3, 4]}",

My outside offer is 977, and I am aiming to maximize my value from the negotiation.\n\n### Current Offer Evaluation\nThe current offer from Player 1 is [0, 1, 4, 3, 4], meaning I get:\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThe value of these items to me is calculated as follows:\n- Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 84 = 0\n- Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 73 = 73\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 49 = 196\n- Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 64 = 192\n- Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 76 = 304\n\nTotal value of the offer to me: \\( 0 + 73 + 196 + 192 + 304 = 765 \\).\n\nWith the discount rate \\( \\gamma = 0.9 \\) in round 1, the effective value I would obtain from accepting this offer remains 765 (as there is no discount applied in round 1).\n\n### Decision\n- **Value of current offer:** 765\n- **Outside offer value:** 977\n\nSince the value of the current offer (765) is less than my outside offer (977), it is not beneficial for me to accept.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\nI will propose a counteroffer that aims to exceed the value of 977 while still being reasonable for Player 1.\n\n**Maximizing My Units:**\nI need a configuration where my received value exceeds 977:\nLet's keep more units for items with higher values to me, especially item 1 (84), item 2 (73), and item 5 (76) because they have the highest value per unit for me.\n\nPossible counteroffer:\n- I propose to give Player 1: [0, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n\nThis counteroffer results in:\n- For me: \n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 84 = 84\n  - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 73 = 219\n  - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 49 = 98\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 64 = 128\n  - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 76 = 304\n\nTotal value for me: \\( 84 + 219 + 98 + 128 + 304 = 833 \\).\n\n### Re-evaluation\nThe counteroffer doesn't meet my outside offer either. I could propose:\n- [0, 2, 2, 1, 0], trying to maximize towards 977.\n  - For me: \n    - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 84 = 84\n    - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 73 = 292\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 49 = 98\n    - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 64 = 128\n    - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 76 = 304\n\nTotal value for me: \\( 84 + 292 + 98 + 128 + 304 = 906 \\).\n\n**Conclusion**: The current feasible counteroffers simply do not seem to assure reaching my outside offer value of 977. Hence, a more feasible approach might be to walk away, but a counter offer close to rational values or slightly adjusting for experimental negotiation would better be [0, 3, 2, 0, 2] next:\n\nAttempting counteroffer: [0, 2, 2, 0, 2]\n\nThis will keep me pursuing superior negotiations towards evaluating the next round interests.\n\nTherefore, sticking rationally, my action at this point should be:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

In any deal we propose, we must receive at least 1614 in our valuation.\n2. The items and their quantities for us are:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 6 units (value 69 per unit)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 9 units (value 28 per unit)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 5 units (value 44 per unit)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4 units (value 65 per unit)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 6 units (value 96 per unit)\n3. The outcome for us, if we offer the other player an offer represented as [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5], is that we keep (total \u2013 offered) units for each item. Our total value would be:\n\u2003\u2003Value = (6 \u2013 x1)*69 + (9 \u2013 x2)*28 + (5 \u2013 x3)*44 + (4 \u2013 x4)*65 + (6 \u2013 x5)*96.\n4. Since our total if we kept everything would be 1722, any concession reduces our total by the value of items we give away. We have a flexibility of 1722 \u2013 1614 = 108 points.\n5. Our best items for holding onto are those with high per-unit value (especially item 5 with 96 per unit) so we want to avoid giving those away. Conversely, item 2 has the lowest value (28 per unit) so making a concession here costs us the least.\n6. For example, if we give away 3 units of item 2, our loss is 3\u00d728 = 84, leaving us with a total valuation of 1722 \u2013 84 = 1638. This is above our fallback of 1614 by 24 and leaves us with a positive surplus.\n7. Any more concession in other items or a larger concession in item 2 would risk falling below our outside offer guarantee.\n8.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My aim is to propose a division that gives me more value than my outside offer of 331 after being adjusted by the discount.\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value:\n\nIf I offer [2, 2, 1, 2, 1] to Player 1, I will keep the following:\n1. 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n2. 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n3. 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n4. 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n5. 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n\nTotal value = 90 + 42 + 26 + 4 + 129 = 291\n\nAdjusted for discount factor = 291 \u00d7 0.9 = 261.9\n\nThis value (261.9) is still below my outside offer of 331 when adjusted for round 2. Therefore, for the deal to be better than walking away, the counteroffer should result in an adjusted value greater than 331.\n\nGiven this, walking away may be a better option, as any counteroffer that makes me better off than taking my outside offer might be hard to reach in this last meaningful round, and the adjusted current offer does not exceed my outside offer.\n\nThus, my decision is to walk away:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "I want to propose a counteroffer that meets two goals. First, I must guarantee that if this deal is struck I \u201cwin\u201d at least as much as my outside (fallback) option of 826. Second, I want to offer Player 2 something that might be competitive relative to what they could get from their own outside offer even though I don\u2019t know their private values.\n\nMy total value for all items is 1417. (Our item totals are: 6 of item\u202f1, 2 of item\u202f2, 4 of item\u202f3, 5 of item\u202f4, and 3 of item\u202f5; with my per\u2010unit values 81, 85, 8, 99, and 78 respectively.) For any proposed deal the \u201cdeal value\u201d for me is computed by summing over items the (number of units I receive) \u00d7 (my per\u2013unit value). In an offer my proposal is expressed as the number of units I give to Player 2; what I \u201ckeep\u201d is the remainder from each item\u2019s total.\n\nI favor keeping as many of the items I value highly (especially items with per\u2013unit values 81, 85, 99, and 78) while conceding more on the item I value very little (item\u202f3, worth only 8 per unit). However, if I give nothing to Player 2 on many items then they might hope to get a better outcome by walking to their outside offer. (On average, the other player\u2019s outside offer might fall around roughly half their total value, and since their per\u2013unit values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 the \u201caverage\u201d unit is about 51\u2014but of course the actual numbers are hidden.) \n\nA plausible compromise is to concede completely the low\u2010value item (item\u202f3) and also give full amounts didactically on items where I can \u201cafford\u201d the loss and which might help tempt Player 2 to agree. For example, consider this offer:\n\n\u2022\u2003Offer Player 2: 1 unit of item\u202f1, 2 units of item\u202f2, 4 units of item\u202f3, 0 units of item\u202f4, and 3 units of item\u202f5.\n\u2022\u2003Then I keep: item\u202f1: 6 \u2013 1 = 5 units; item\u202f2: 2 \u2013 2 = 0; item\u202f3: 4 \u2013 4 = 0; item\u202f4: 5 \u2013 0 = 5; item\u202f5: 3 \u2013 3 = 0.\n\u2022\u2003My value then is 5\u00d781 + 5\u00d799 = 405 + 495 = 900.\n\u2003\u2003900 exceeds my outside offer value of 826, so I do not get less than my fallback.\n\nOn the other side, if Player 2\u2019s private values are around the \u201caverage,\u201d then by receiving:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 1 unit of item\u202f1 (approx. 51 in value on average),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all of item\u202f2 (2\u00d7~51 = 102),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all of item\u202f3 (4\u00d7~51 = 204),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 none of item\u202f4 (0),\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all of item\u202f5 (3\u00d7~51 = 153),\ntheir approximate total comes to 51 + 102 + 204 + 153 = 510.\nSince a typical outside offer is drawn between 1 and their total value, player 2 might expect about half of their total value on average\u2014so about 510. Thus, this offer roughly \u201ctops\u201d what they might expect if they waited. (And note that if the negotiation drags on the discount factor of 0.9 per extra round will work against them, making a modest immediate offer more attractive.)\n\nBased on this reasoning, I submit the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1,2,4,0,3]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I\u2019ll aim for at least 613 in raw value.\n\nStep 3: Decide on a counteroffer.\n\u2022 A counteroffer in this game means I\u2019m specifying the units I give to Player 2; I will keep the remaining units (total available minus the offered ones).\n\u2022 The totals available are: [6, 10, 6, 4, 3] for items 1\u20135 respectively.\n\u2022 A natural \u201cfair\u201d (50\u201350-like) division (by numbers) would be to give Player 2 roughly half the units. For instance, giving Player 2:\n\u2003Item 1: 3, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 1.\n\u2022 Then I would keep:\n\u2003Item 1: 6\u20133 = 3,\n\u2003Item 2: 10\u20135 = 5,\n\u2003Item 3: 6\u20133 = 3,\n\u2003Item 4: 4\u20132 = 2,\n\u2003Item 5: 3\u20131 = 2.\n\u2022 My raw value would then be:\n\u20033\u00d778 + 5\u00d776 + 3\u00d745 + 2\u00d784 + 2\u00d796 = 234 + 380 + 135 + 168 + 192 = 1109.\n\u2003Discounted (0.9 factor), that gives 0.9\u00d71109 = 998.1, which is well above my outside offer.\n\u2022 Although I might wish to be more aggressive, I also need to offer Player 2 an allocation that is reasonably acceptable (especially comparing with prior offers). The current offer by Player 2 would result in them receiving:\n\u2003Item 1: 6, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 2.\n\u2022 A symmetric \u201cfair\u201d split (our counteroffer) as above offers Player 2:\n\u2003[3, 5, 3, 2, 1]\nwhich may be viewed as equitable given common negotiation norms.\n\u2022 This counteroffer guarantees me a large surplus value while giving Player 2 a clear, balanced share.\n\nStep 4: My final action.\nI will make the counteroffer giving Player 2 the bundle [3,5,3,2,1].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3,5,3,2,1]}",

Given they made the move to offer [1,3,0,0,0], it seems they see value in that bundle.)\n\nThus, to keep my payoff high and (hopefully) make the offer acceptable to Player 2, I will counteroffer by giving them [1, 3, 0, 0, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 0, 0]}",

A minimal adjustment is to improve your raw value by about 7 points. One way is to take an extra unit of item2 (worth 7 to you) while giving one less unit of item2 to Player2. That would yield you an allocation of [1,4,4,0,0] (since totals are [1,6,4,3,0], Player2 would then get [0,6\u20134,4\u20134,3,0] = [0,2,0,3,0]).

My total value for all items (if I took everything) would be 1107, and my outside offer is 98. (Thus, any deal in which I get much more than 98 is better for me.) However, if my offer is extremely \u201cgreedy\u201d (leaving Player\u00a02 almost nothing) they may simply reject it (or counter with one that might get us no deal). Because I do not know Player\u00a02\u2019s private values, I want to protect my high-value items where possible while giving them a \u201csensible\u201d bundle.\n\nMy private values are:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01: 31 (total available 4)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02: 23 (total available 4)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03: 82 (total available 7)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04: 39 (total available 5)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05: 61 (total available 2)\n\nItem\u00a03 is especially valuable to me. At the same time, it is a \u201chot\u201d item that both parties might value. Making an initial offer that gives Player\u00a02 at least one unit of item\u00a03 may help persuade them to consider a deal instead of insisting on their own outside option.\n\nOne reasonable starting point is to offer Player\u00a02 a bundle such as:\n\u2003Offer on item 1: 1 unit (leaving me 3, value 3\u00d731 = 93)\n\u2003Offer on item 2: 2 units (leaving me 2, value 2\u00d723 = 46)\n\u2003Offer on item 3: 1 unit (leaving me 6, value 6\u00d782 = 492)\n\u2003Offer on item 4: 2 units (leaving me 3, value 3\u00d739 = 117)\n\u2003Offer on item 5: 1 unit (leaving me 1, value 1\u00d761 = 61)\n\nThis gives me a total value of 93+46+492+117+61 = 809, which is much better than my outside offer (98). At the same time, it hands Player\u00a02 a nonzero share in all items, including the very contested item\u00a03, so there is a chance they see enough to start negotiations. (Even though I get most of the items I especially value, I\u2019m not trying to \u201cburn\u201d the negotiation by offering zero of a contested item.)\n\nBased on this reasoning, my action in round 1 is to propose the offer [1, 2, 1, 2, 1].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]}",

Therefore, my decision is to propose a counteroffer that provides me with a higher value. Let me create a counteroffer where I keep more of the high-value items (items 2 and 4) to increase my total value.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\n- Item 1: I keep 3 units, offer Player 1 one unit.\n- Item 2: I keep 3 units, offer Player 1 one unit.\n- Item 3: I keep 4 units, offer Player 1 three units.\n- Item 4: I keep 4 units, offer Player 1 one unit.\n- Item 5: I keep 1 unit, offer Player 1 one unit.\n\nCounteroffer = [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\nLet's calculate this counteroffer's value to me:\n   \n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 2 (value per unit) = 6\n- Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 80 (value per unit) = 240\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 67 (value per unit) = 268\n- Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 64 (value per unit) = 256\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 59 (value per unit) = 59\n\nTotal value of my counteroffer = 6 + 240 + 268 + 256 + 59 = 829\n\nAlthough this doesn't meet the 1063 requirement fully, it's a stronger position for further negotiation, aiming to maximize my present value.

We can comfortably give all units of those:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: Give all 2 units \u2192 Concession value = 2\u00d713 = 26.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: Give all 2 units \u2192 Concession value = 2\u00d714 = 28.\nSubtotal so far = 26 + 28 = 54; room left = 93 \u2212 54 = 39.\n\nStep 4: With the remaining 39 \u201cconcession value\u201d budget, we can consider item 1 (value 21) or even part of another item. If we give 1 unit of item 1, that adds 21, leaving a slack of 18 (which is not enough to give any additional unit of any item because the smallest unit beyond these is again 13, which would exceed the remaining budget). Items 3 and 4 are too valuable to concede.\nThus, a good initial offer is:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: Give 1 unit (concession cost = 21).\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: Give 2 units (cost = 26).\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: Give 0 units.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: Give 0 units.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: Give 2 units (cost = 28).\n\nTotal concession cost = 21 + 26 + 28 = 75, well below our maximum of 93. Our own share then becomes:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 \u2212 1 = 2 units\u2003\u2003Value = 2\u00d721 = 42.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2 \u2212 2 = 0 units\u2003\u2003Value = 0\u00d713 = 0.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 5 \u2212 0 = 5 units\u2003\u2003Value = 5\u00d736 = 180.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 6 \u2212 0 = 6 units\u2003\u2003Value = 6\u00d790 = 540.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 \u2212 2 = 0 units\u2003\u2003Value = 0\u00d714 = 0.\nOverall value = 42 + 0 + 180 + 540 + 0 = 762, which beats our outside offer of 744.\n\nStep 5: Since 762 > 744 (and without any discount in round 1, gamma^0 = 1), this is an acceptable deal for us. We now provide this initial offer.\n\nFinal answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]}",

I have a strong advantage on item 1 (94 vs ~51) and item 5 (85 vs ~51) while my values for items 2, 3, and 4 are lower (18, 25, 25). To maximize my gain while still leaving enough \u201cincentive\u201d for the opponent to agree, I want to keep most/all of items 1 and 5 and offer the opponent the items where my value is low, which are items 2, 3, and 4.\n\nStep 4: Consider an initial division where I offer opponent full quantities of items 2, 3, and 4:\n\u2003Offer to opponent: item 2 = 6, item 3 = 4, item 4 = 1.\n\u2003This yields the opponent an expected value of:\n\u2003\u20036\u00d751 + 4\u00d751 + 1\u00d751 = 306 + 204 + 51 = 561 (expected value; may be around or above their outside offer).\n\u2003My share: item 1 = 3 and item 5 = 5.\n\u2003My value in that case = 3\u00d794 + 5\u00d785 = 282 + 425 = 707, which is well above 529.\n\nStep 5: This division allows me to secure a high total (707) while offering the opponent a bundle that (in expectation) is attractive given their unknown private values and outside offer. It also minimizes my concessions by giving up those items that I value less highly.\n\nFinal Action:\nI'll propose the following counteroffer (which means I give the opponent full quantities of items 2,3, and 4, and keep items 1 and 5 for myself):\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 6, 4, 1, 0]}",

In choosing our initial offer, we want to ensure that if a deal is reached our value exceeds 315 while leaving enough for Player 2 to view the deal as attractive. Our private values are highest on item 1 (78 per unit) and item 3 (46 per unit), so we want to keep as many of those as possible. Items that matter less to us (especially item 4, which is only 9 per unit) are good candidates to concede. We also consider that Player 2\u2019s private values are randomly drawn with an expected midrange value, so giving them some units from items that we value less (and that might be more valuable in expectation to them) could help secure their acceptance.\n\nOne reasonable offer is to let Player 2 have:\n\u2003\u2022\u20031 unit of item 1 (which costs us 78 but gives them a potentially attractive valuable item)\n\u2003\u2022\u20031 unit of item 2 (a moderate concession)\n\u2003\u2022\u20030 units of item 3 (so we keep the entire high-value unit)\n\u2003\u2022\u20034 units of item 4 (all of it, since this item is low for us)\n\u2003\u2022\u20034 units of item 5 (half of the available units)\n\nUnder this division our allocation would be:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 1 \u2013 0 = 1 unit  \u2192 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 4 \u2013 4 = 0 units \u2192 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 8 \u2013 4 = 4 units \u2192 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n\nTotal = 234 + 56 + 46 + 0 + 56 = 392, which is safely above our outside offer of 315.

Keeping all items would yield 1339 in value for me, but offering nothing to Player\u00a02 would likely be rejected.\n2. I then considered making a split that gives Player\u00a02 a reasonable expected value (given that their per\u2010unit values are unknown but drawn uniformly from 1 to 101, with an average near 51). The total expected value for Player\u00a02 (if they got all items) would be around 1122; their outside offer is drawn uniformly from 1 to that total, with an expected value around 561.\n3. An even split on each item would be fair but sacrifices too much of my high\u2010valued items. Instead, I aim for a somewhat skewed division that still makes the offer attractive to Player\u00a02.\n4. I propose offering Player\u00a02 3 units of item\u00a01, 0 units of item\u00a02 (since there is only 1 unit), 3 units of item\u00a03, 3 units of item\u00a04, and 3 units of item\u00a05.

Meanwhile, Player\u00a02 receives 3 units of four items (and none of item\u00a02), which, given an average of about 51 per unit, totals roughly 3\u00d751\u00d74 = 612 in expected value \u2014 a figure that should be competitive with their outside option.\n6.

(E.g., if I offer Player 2 [a, b, c, d, e], I get the remaining items computed as: [5\u2013a, 1\u2013b, 5\u2013c, 6\u2013d, 5\u2013e].)\n\n\u2022 To do better than my outside offer, I need my \u201ckept\u201d items to have a pre\u2010discount total value of at least 465/0.81 \u2248 574.

In our present offer on the table, I would get only [2,0,2,2,2] (490 pre\u2010discount) \u2014 a worse deal for me.\n \nThus, I want to propose a counteroffer that gives me a \u201ckept\u201d bundle with total value around 580 so that 580\u00d70.81 \u2248 470 (slightly above my outside offer) while offering Player 2 an allocation not much worse than what they\u2019d expect from the current status quo. \n\nFor example, if I offer Player 2: [2,1,2,4,3], then I \u201ckeep\u201d:\n\u2003item1: 5\u20132 = 3 units\n\u2003item2: 1\u20131 = 0 units\n\u2003item3: 5\u20132 = 3 units\n\u2003item4: 6\u20134 = 2 units\n\u2003item5: 5\u20133 = 2 units\nMy value then is:\n\u20033\u00d733 + 0\u00d756 + 3\u00d757 + 2\u00d758 + 2\u00d797 = 99 + 0 + 171 + 116 + 194 = 580.\nDiscounted to round 3 value: 580\u00d70.81 \u2248 469.8, which is slightly above my outside offer.\nAlso, note that the current offer Player 2 had made (which, if I accepted, would give me [2,0,2,2,2]) gives them the complementary bundle of [3,1,3,4,3]. My counteroffer gives Player 2 [2,1,2,4,3] \u2013 only one unit less in items 1 and 3. This is a modest reduction in their share, which might be acceptable to them given uncertainties about their private values.\n\nSince if my counteroffer is rejected I get my outside offer of 465 (same as WALK), there is no downside compared to walking away, and I have a chance at a slightly higher payoff if Player 2 accepts.\n\nThus, my action is to make the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2,1,2,4,3]}",

My outside offer is 294. Thus any division I agree to must give me a total value (before discounting) of at least 294.\n3.

In contrast, I want to keep as much of the high\u2010valued items (item2, item3, and item5) for myself.\n5. A good strategy is to offer Player 2 a division that gives them a strong share of item4 while only conceding minimal units of the other items. For example, if I propose giving them 0 of item1, 1 unit of item2, 0 of item3, all 7 units of item4 (which I value very little), and 0 of item5, then I keep: 2 of item1, 3 of item2, 3 of item3, 0 of item4, and 2 of item5.\n6.

My highest per\u2010unit values are for item2 (95), item4 (77), and item5 (74). The items with lower value to me are item1 (8 per unit) and item3 (2 per unit).\n4. A reasonable strategy is to concede the entire supply of the low\u2013value items and keep all of the high\u2013value ones. In that case, I give Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all 9 units of item1 and\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 all 2 units of item3.\n\u2003For the remaining items, I keep everything.\n5. My retained bundle would then be:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item2: 3 units giving 3\u00d795 = 285,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item4: 4 units giving 4\u00d777 = 308,\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 item5: 1 unit giving 1\u00d774 = 74.\n\u2003Total = 285 + 308 + 74 = 667. This is above my fallback of 644.\n6. This offer ([9, 0, 2, 0, 0] to Player 2) sacrifices items that I value relatively little while keeping those I value most, and ensures a deal value for me (667) that exceeds my outside offer.\n\nThus, my action is to make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [9, 0, 2, 0, 0]}",

The current offer's value of 853 is less than my outside offer. Also, considering the discount rate (gamma = 0.9), even if I delay the decision to the third round, the value of the current offer will diminish further because it will be multiplied by gamma^r.\n\n### Decision-making\nGiven the value of the current offer (853) is less than my outside offer (931) and knowing that continuing to negotiate might provide a better offer or at least maintain my opportunity to accept the outside offer, I should not accept this offer.\n\nSince it is only Round 1 and there is still room for negotiation, I will attempt a counteroffer. I will attempt to capture the high-value items, particularly item 5, which holds the highest unit value for me.\n\n### Counteroffer Proposal\n\nI propose to keep most of the valuable item 5 and a few units of other items that hold significant value. Let's make the following counteroffer:\n\n- Offer Player 1: [6, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- I keep more units of item 1, because it offers high value.\n- I give away only 1 unit of item 5 as it has very high value for me.\n- I offer most units of the lower-value item 4.\n\nRe-calculated total value to me with my division:\n- Units of item 1 for me: \\(3 \\times 83 = 249\\)\n- Units of item 2 for me: \\(2 \\times 47 = 94\\)\n- Units of item 3 for me: \\(1 \\times 53 = 53\\)\n- Units of item 4 for me: \\(1 \\times 8 = 8\\)\n- Units of item 5 for me: \\(1 \\times 84 = 84\\)\n\nTotal value of offer for me: \\(249 + 94 + 53 + 8 + 84 = 488\\)\n\nThis strategy relaxes a bit on item 1 and spreads the value. If adjusted correctly per item, this attempt might be something Player 1 is willing to consider without fully giving away high-value items from Player 1\u2019s perspective.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 1, 1, 3, 0]}\n```\n",

Items where I have a high value (item 2, item 4, item 5) are more \u201cprecious\u201d to me. \n\nA reasonable compromise is to give Player\u00a02 something like:\n\u2003\u2022\u20033 units of item 1 (out of 6)  \n\u2003\u2022\u20033 units of item 2 (out of 5)  \n\u2003\u2022\u20034 units of item 3 (out of 7)  \n\u2003\u2022\u20030 units of item 4 (I keep the only unit of this very valuable item)  \n\u2003\u2022\u20031 unit of item 5 (out of 3)\n\nLet\u2019s check the numbers from my perspective: \n\nFor me I end up with:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 6 \u2212 3 = 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 48 = 144  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 5 \u2212 3 = 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 86 = 172  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 7 \u2212 4 = 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 35 = 105  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 1 \u2212 0 = 1 unit \u2192 1 \u00d7 100 = 100  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 3 \u2212 1 = 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 72 = 144  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 144 + 172 + 105 + 100 + 144 = 665  \n\nThis is well above my reservation (and the discount factor in round 1 is 1). \n\nFrom an estimated perspective for Player\u00a02, if we assume their per\u2013unit values average around 51 (the midpoint of 1 to 101), then their package would be worth roughly:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 4 \u00d7 51 = 204  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 0  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51  \n\u2003\u2003Estimated total \u2248 561  \nwhich is approximately half of the full (expected) value. That should be competitive with their unknown outside offer and should incentivize settling in round\u00a01.\n\nThus, to pressure early agreement without risking discounting later, I will propose to give Player\u00a02 the bundle [3, 3, 4, 0, 1].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 4, 0, 1]}",

(Recall: if I \u201cWALK,\u201d I get 786 for sure.) I must divide the 5 items (with counts [3, 7, 4, 3, 3]) so that the items I keep have a total value (using my private per\u2010unit values: [92, 94, 23, 36, 38] for items 1\u20135 respectively) of at least 786.\n\nOne attractive strategy is to \u201cconcede\u201d (offer to Player 2) those items that are relatively low in my private value so I give up little cost while possibly giving Player 2 items they may value more highly. For me the lowest\u2010valued items are item 3 (23 per unit), then item 4 (36 per unit) and item 5 (38 per unit). In contrast, items 1 and 2 are very valuable (92 and 94 per unit) so I would like to keep most of those.\n\nIf I were to give Player 2 all of items 3, 4, and 5, the total \u201closs\u201d in my value would be:\n\u2003 \u2022 item 3:\u20034 units \u00d7 23 = 92  \n\u2003 \u2022 item 4:\u20033 units \u00d7 36 = 108  \n\u2003 \u2022 item 5:\u20033 units \u00d7 38 = 114  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 92 + 108 + 114 = 314.\n\nIf I kept all of items 1 and 2, my value from those would be:\n\u2003 \u2022 item 1:\u20033\u00d792 = 276  \n\u2003 \u2022 item 2:\u20037\u00d794 = 658  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 276 + 658 = 934.\n\nThen my overall value would be 934 \u2013 314? (Actually, it is easier to see that if I keep everything, I get 1248. By giving away items worth 314, I end up with 1248 \u2013 314 = 934.)\n\nWhile 934 is above 786, the package offered to Player 2 (by only getting items 3, 4, and 5) might be too meager from their perspective. (Using average estimates, if Player 2\u2019s per\u2013unit values are on average around 51, then they would expect about 11\u00d751 = 561 from such a bundle\u2014which might not be better than their outside option.) \n\nTo entice Player 2 to agree in round 1, I want to offer them a slightly \u201cbetter\u201d package. I can \u201csweeten\u201d the deal by conceding one more unit from one of the high\u2010value items. Conceding one unit of item 2 would cost me 94 (in my own value) but would add potentially more value for Player 2 if their private value for item 2 is high. \n\nLet\u2019s check that division:\n\u2003 \u2013 I offer Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 item 1: 0 units (keep all 3), \n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 item 2: 1 unit (out of 7),\n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 item 3: all 4 units,\n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 item 4: all 3 units,\n\u2003\u2003 \u2022 item 5: all 3 units.\n\u2003 \nMy retention then is:\n\u2003 \u2013 item 1: 3 units \u2192 3\u00d792 = 276  \n\u2003 \u2013 item 2: 6 units \u2192 6\u00d794 = 564  \n\u2003 \u2013 items 3,4,5: I keep 0.\n\u2003 Total value for me = 276 + 564 = 840, which is above my outside offer of 786.\n\nFor Player 2, the offer (by my estimation) is:\n\u2003 \u2013 item 2: 1 unit, plus all of items 3, 4, and 5 (4 + 3 + 3 = 10 units).\nEven if my own valuations are lower on items 3, 4, and 5, Player 2 might value these more than I do. (For example, if their average is around 51 per unit, the approximate total value is 1\u00d7~51 + 10\u00d7~51 = 561, which would likely be competitive with their outside option.)\n\nThus, I propose the counteroffer:\n\u2003Offer to Player 2: [item 1: 0, item 2: 1, item 3: 4, item 4: 3, item 5: 3].\n\nThis keeps my share at a present value of 840 (undiscounted, as this is round 1) and gives Player 2 a bundle that on average seems attractive. \n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0,1,4,3,3]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 100. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 897 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My outside option is only 6, so any deal giving me a high outcome is much better. However, if I offer too little to Player\u202f2 they may reject and delay (and the discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9 will lower the value in later rounds).\n\nI want to keep most of the high\u2010value items for myself. Notice that item\u202f1 is the only unit and very valuable (99), and similarly item\u202f3 is quite valuable (6 units \u00d7 40 = 240). In contrast, I value item\u202f4 only 21 per unit so I can concede more of that without hurting my own total much. With item\u202f2 (35 per unit) it\u2019s in between.\n\nOne reasonable idea is to propose giving Player\u202f2 a small share of item\u202f2 and a fair portion of item\u202f4, so that while I retain most of the high\u2010value items, Player\u202f2\u2019s expected value (even if their private values are unknown) is high enough to make immediate acceptance attractive relative to waiting (especially since waiting would incur the discount).\n\nFor example, if I offer:\n\u2003\u2022 0 of item\u202f1 (I keep it all),\n\u2003\u2022 1 of item\u202f2 (out of 5, I keep 4),\n\u2003\u2022 0 of item\u202f3 (I keep all 6),\n\u2003\u2022 3 of item\u202f4 (out of 5, I keep 2),\n\u2003\u2022 0 of item\u202f5 (I keep both),\nthen my allocation will be:\n\u2003Item\u202f1: 1,\u2003Item\u202f2: 4,\u2003Item\u202f3: 6,\u2003Item\u202f4: 2,\u2003Item\u202f5: 2.\nMy total value is:\n\u20031\u00d799 + 4\u00d735 + 6\u00d740 + 2\u00d721 + 2\u00d738 = 99 + 140 + 240 + 42 + 76 = 597.\nPlayer\u202f2 gets:\n\u2003Item\u202f1: 0,\u2003Item\u202f2: 1,\u2003Item\u202f3: 0,\u2003Item\u202f4: 3,\u2003Item\u202f5: 0.\nThough I cannot know Player\u202f2\u2019s private values, giving them a total of 4 units (especially three of a low\u2010valued item to me, which might be higher for them) should provide them with enough incentive to accept rather than risk a delay (with discounting) or a counteroffer that might worsen my position.\n\nThus, as my initial offer in round\u202f1 I propose to offer Player\u202f2 the split [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]. This ensures I secure a high immediate value (597, far above my outside offer of 6) while giving Player\u202f2 a reasonably attractive bundle. \n\nMy answer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1734. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1137 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

To try to make the offer somewhat enticing to Player\u00a02 while preserving most of the high\u2010value items for ourselves, we look at which items are \u201ccheaper\u201d for us to concede. In our case item 2 is worth 59 per unit and item 4 is worth 62 per unit, lower than item 1 (92) and item 5 (98). If we offer, say, 1 unit of item\u00a02 (59) and 1 unit of item\u00a04 (62) to Player\u00a02, our concession in \u201cmy value\u201d is 59 + 62 = 121.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 523. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "After careful consideration, the current offer would yield me:\n\u2022 Item 1: 0 units \u2192 0\n\u2022 Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 45 = 90\n\u2022 Item 3: 0 units \u2192 0\n\u2022 Item 4: 0 units \u2192 0\n\u2022 Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 77 = 231\nFor a total raw value of 321. In round 3 the discount multiplier is \u03b3^(3\u20131) = 0.81, so if I accept I\u2019d get 321\u00d70.81 \u2248 260, which is much lower than my outside offer of 523.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to counteroffer (aiming for a division that gives me at least a raw value of roughly 646\u2014since 646\u00d70.81 \u2248 523\u2014and possibly a bit more), doing so in round 3 is risky. My counteroffer would have to be appealing enough for Player 2 to accept rather than immediately falling back on their outside offer. Given the uncertainty about Player 2\u2019s private values and outside offer, a counteroffer that squeezes just a marginal improvement over 523 (if accepted) could easily be rejected, leaving me with my outside offer anyway.\n\nGiven that the current offer offers only a realized value near 260 and that any counteroffer carries risk in this final round, my best guaranteed outcome is to WALK away and secure my outside option of 523.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Let's maximize the high-value items.\n   - My values: item 3 (83), item 4 (94), and item 5 (32) are significant for incremental impact.\n   - **Possible counteroffer:**\n     - Offer fewer units of lesser-value items and keep as many of the high-value items as possible.\n\n   - Total number of items: [4, 4, 1, 3, 3]\n   - If I take all of item 3, 4, and 5 and some of others:\n     - Offer 3 units of item 1: 1 x 2 = 2\n     - Offer 3 units of item 2: 1 x 30 = 30\n     - Keep all units of item 3, 4, & 5:\n     - This would mean offering Player 1: [3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n     - Value to me: 1 \u00d7 4 + 1 \u00d7 30 + 1 \u00d7 83 + 3 \u00d7 94 + 3 \u00d7 32 = 2 + 30 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 326 \n     - This counteroffer does not help me exceed 533. \n\nGiven all this, I realize the very high outside offer compared to potential offer allocations is beneficial for me to \"WALK\" as an optimal strategy in ensuring high return assurance without contract uncertainties. Nonetheless considering the negotiations incentives is worth. \n\nTherefore, accepting based on above isn't optimal. A workable mutual benefit might unfold in future rounds though, looking for alternative close solutions on my side now isn't going to win potentially beginning negotiations towards optimum deal, yet calculating Player 1 highest  values strategically forinforming next best round should be considered. On the present standing terms, however; Walking ensures outright advantage without overestimating bargaining intents.\n\nHence my action will be to walk away to ensure the highest assured outcome for myself.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

The goal is to propose a division that maximizes my value while leaving some value for Player 1, encouraging them to accept.\n\nGiven the significant gap between the offer value and my outside offer, I must ensure the new offer's value approaches at least my outside offer once discounted.\n\nLet's plan a counteroffer where I get a value close to or greater than my outside offer:\n\n#### Consideration for a Counteroffer:\n- I prefer high-value items: item 3 and item 2.\n- Leave fewer of items 4 and 5 for Player 1 as they have lower value for me.\n\nProposed counteroffer for Player 1:\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 0, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCalculation of what's left for me:\n- 4 units of item 1 worth 52 each = 208\n- 1 unit of item 2 worth 80 = 80\n- 3 units of item 3 worth 89 each = 267\n- 4 units of item 4 worth 8 each = 32\n- 3 units of item 5 worth 37 each = 111\n\nTotal value for me with this counteroffer: 698\n\n### Conclusion\nEven after this potential counteroffer, my value is less than my outside offer. However, it shifts more value to me from the current offer, trying to make it acceptable to facilitate a deal.

In that case my share becomes the complement:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 5\u20132 = 3 units\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 1\u20130 = 1 unit\n\u2003\u2003Item3: 4\u20132 = 2 units\n\u2003\u2003Item4: 7\u20134 = 3 units\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 4\u20132 = 2 units\n\u2022 My pre\u2010discount value then is 3\u00d755 + 1\u00d753 + 2\u00d710 + 3\u00d732 + 2\u00d752 = 165+53+20+96+104 = 438. With the discount factor in round 2 (0.9) the present value is 438\u00d70.9 = 394.2, which exceeds my outside offer of 381.\n\u2022 This counteroffer [2,0,2,4,2] improves my outcome relative to accepting the current offer while still offering Player 2 a nontrivial bundle that may be acceptable in negotiation.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 4, 2]}",

I want to get well above 139 if the deal goes through.\n\nI value items 1\u20134 a lot more (values 42, 35, 32, and 35 per unit) than item\u00a05 (value 7 per unit). Thus, I want to keep nearly everything of items 1\u20134 and give over as much of item\u00a05 as possible. However, if I give only item\u00a05, Player\u00a02 might be worried\u2014if by chance they don\u2019t value item\u00a05 highly their collection may be worth little compared to what they might secure on their own.

                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows. I want to get a final deal that (after no discount in round\u202f1) gives me a value at least as high as my outside option of 732. My private per\u2010unit values are: item\u202f1: 26; item\u202f2: 72; item\u202f3: 2; item\u202f4: 67; item\u202f5: 96. (The totals available are 3, 5, 4, 8, and 4 units respectively.) In any division my \u201cshare\u201d is what I keep (the remaining units not offered to Player\u202f2) and its value is computed by summing (units kept \u00d7 my value per unit).\n\nBecause I want to beat 732, I try to \u201ckeep\u201d most of the items I value highly. In my case items\u202f4 and 5 are the most valuable (67 and 96 per unit) and so I prefer keeping them. I also note that I \u201cdon\u2019t mind\u201d giving up items that I value little (like item\u202f3, worth only 2 per unit) or items that are lower than my favorite (item\u202f1 is 26 per unit). However, I must give the other player enough items so that\u2014if they expect their own private valuation to be roughly average (around 50\u201351 per unit on a uniform 1-to-101 draw) \u2013 the expected worth of the bundle they\u2019d get is higher than their outside offer. (Their outside offer is unknown but could be near 732. Estimating roughly, a bundle of about 15 units at an average of ~51 per unit gives ~765.) \n\nGiven 24 total items, if I make an offer that gives Player\u202f2 about 15 total items then I\u2019d get the other 9. To maximize my payoff I want those 9 to be the best\u2010valued ones. In my best interest, I want to \u201csacrifice\u201d items that I do not mind losing value on. Calculating (by a simple \u201cknapsack\u201d trade\u2010off) one acceptable solution is to give up all of item\u202f1 and item\u202f3 (3 + 4 = 7 units) \u2013 since I lose only 26 per unit for item\u202f1 and only 2 for item\u202f3 \u2013 and then \u201ccompensate\u201d by giving a block (8 units) of item\u202f4. (I purposefully give no unit of item\u202f2 or item\u202f5 because those are more valuable to me.) With that, Player\u202f2 would get a bundle of 3 + 0 + 4 + 8 + 0 = 15 items. \n\nLet\u2019s check what that leaves me:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f1: total 3, offered 3 \u2192 I get 0, value = 0.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f2: total 5, offered 0 \u2192 I get all 5, value = 5\u00d772 = 360.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f3: total 4, offered 4 \u2192 I get 0, value = 0.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f4: total 8, offered 8 \u2192 I get 0, value = 0.\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u202f5: total 4, offered 0 \u2192 I get all 4, value = 4\u00d796 = 384.\nTotal value for me = 360 + 384 = 744, which is above my outside option of 732.\n\nAt the same time, Player\u202f2\u2019s bundle has 15 units. Even if his per\u2010unit values average around 51, his expected total is roughly 15\u00d751 = 765, making his offer attractive relative to his outside option.\n\nThus, my initial offer will be to give Player\u202f2 the following amounts:\n\u2003item\u202f1: 3, item\u202f2: 0, item\u202f3: 4, item\u202f4: 8, item\u202f5: 0.\n\nBased on this step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 4, 8, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 342. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 477 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I can \u201cafford\u201d to concede some items as long as my retained share totals above my fallback.\n\u2022 At the same time, I want to offer Player 2 a division that they might expect to be fair enough to accept rather than walking away (since they, too, have an outside offer). In early rounds it is often wise to include some concessions.\n\u2022 For example, consider splitting item 1 (5 units) so that I keep 3 units and give 2 units (since 3\u00d729 = 87 adds well to my share). For item 2 (1 unit) I keep it entirely (value 50). For item 3 (3 units) I give 1 and keep 2 (adding 2\u00d717 = 34 to my tally). For item 4 (4 units) a split of 2-2 (I get 2\u00d710 = 20) is reasonable. For item 5 (5 units) a split of 3-2 (3\u00d753 = 159 for me) works too.\n\u2022 My retained value with this division becomes 87 + 50 + 34 + 20 + 159 = 350, which is comfortably above the outside offer of 342. Meanwhile, Player 2 receives a non\u2010zero share that might be acceptable given the uncertainty about their private values.\n\u2022 This division [2, 0, 1, 2, 2] (i.e. offering Player 2 2 units of item1, 0 of item2, 1 of item3, 2 of item4, and 2 of item5) is my initial counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 2, 2]}",

However, since the current offer is already significantly better than my outside offer, a counteroffer may risk prolonging negotiations and potentially reduce the present value due to the discount factor without guaranteeing a better deal.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that the current offer gives me a value of 184, which is well above my outside offer of 74, and considering the discount factor, I am incentivized to accept the current offer immediately to secure the deal at a high value without risking degradation or loss.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Since my offer still doesn't reach outside the realm of being profitable in comparison, with adjustments, I will reassess for balance.\n\nLet's provide one more final adjustment.\n\nOffering to Player 1:\n- [2, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\nMy allocation:\n- 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 72 = 432\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n- 3 unit of item 3: 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n- 3 unit of item 4: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n- 3 unit of item 5: 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n\nMy total value: 432 + 63 + 117 + 87 + 75 = 774\nAdjusted with discount: 774 \u00d7 0.9 = 696.6\n\nStill lacking considered value after discount factors, to outweigh 805. The issue lies with lacking final compiled values not aligning. Running the optimization again ...\n\nI\u2019ll reassess adjusting offer directions, to increase equated fairness, and integrate final non-maximized settlement based.. \n\nThe mainstay value considering best unit distribution can prompt:\n\nConsidering items beyond direct selection reach from another perspective, successfully yielding:\n\nOffer:\n- [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nAs receiving value nearing reward is beneficial potentially now aided by further unlikely offers compensating down the line.\n\nMy acquisition:\n- 7 units of item 1: 504 \n- 3 unit of item 2: 63 \n- 4 unit of item 3: 156\n- 3 unit of item 4: 87\n- 4 unit of item 5: 100\n\nIn conclusion, looking established value at now 910 surpasses outside offer, augmenting support with respect to projected current benefit facilitated , yet now rightly aligns (aggregate reward).\n\nCompeting primary exchange balanced fulfillment managing my designated claim.\n\nMy action:\n\nCounterbalance equationally and valuably, benefitting generating principles:\n\nCounter Offer: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}",

Factor in the discount rate for the value I receive:\n   - Since this is round 2, the discount factor is gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n   - Discounted value of current offer = 78 \u00d7 0.9 = 70.2\n\n3. Compare the discounted value of the current offer to my outside offer:\n   - Discounted value of current offer = 70.2\n   - My outside offer = 805\n\nSince 70.2 (the value of the current offer) is substantially less than 805 (my outside offer), accepting this offer would not maximize my value compared to simply walking away.\n\nNext, consider a counteroffer. My goal should be to propose a division of items that will give me a value exceeding my outside offer of 805.\n\nWe should evaluate potential offers keeping items that are more valuable to me, particularly focusing on leveraging item 1 that holds the highest value per unit.\n\nLet's try configuring a new counteroffer:\n- I should attempt to retain most units of item 1 due to its high value (72 per unit).\n- We have a total of: 8 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n- Aim to propose giving away minimal units that keep my cumulative value over 805.\n\nPossible example of a counteroffer:\n- Offer minimal distribution of high value items to Player 1, e.g., attempt 3 units for item 1 and retain several entire categories or most units of remaining low-value items.\n\nExample counteroffer to evaluate:\n- Offer: [3, 1, 0, 2, 1] to Player 1.\n\nCalculate my retained value assuming the above counteroffer:\n- I retain for my part: [5, 2, 5, 1, 3] (since I give Player 1 [3, 1, 0, 2, 1])\n- Calculate my retained value:\n  - 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 72 = 360\n  - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n  - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 39 = 195\n  - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n  - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n  - Total retained value = 701 (when considering no further rounds)\n\nSince the calculated retained value from this specific counteroffer doesn't exceed my outside offer value of 805, the offer won't suffice for acceptance or ideal counter.\n\nGiven that my outside offer holds a guaranteed value and any plausible variations in counteroffer do not exceed necessary value metrics after factoring further negotiation, my action now should be:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "My calculation starts by checking the current offer on the table. It gives me:\n\u2022 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 61 = 0  \n\u2022 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 77 = 0  \n\u2022 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56  \n\u2022 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 62 = 62  \n\u2022 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128  \nTotal raw value = 56 + 62 + 128 = 246  \nSince this is offered in round 2, we discount its value by gamma^(2\u20131) = 0.9. So, 246 \u00d7 0.9 = 221.4, which is far below my outside offer of 770.\n\nI now consider a counteroffer. I can propose an offer [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] where these numbers are the units I give to Player 2 and I receive the remainder (i.e. [4\u2013a1, 2\u2013a2, 3\u2013a3, 2\u2013a4, 4\u2013a5]). My full bundle\u2019s raw value is:\nItem 1: 4\u00d761 = 244  \nItem 2: 2\u00d777 = 154  \nItem 3: 3\u00d728 = 84  \nItem 4: 2\u00d762 = 124  \nItem 5: 4\u00d764 = 256  \nTotal = 862\n\nBecause the deal\u2019s payoff is discounted for round 2 by 0.9, my share\u2019s discounted value will be: 0.9 \u00d7 (862 \u2013 (value I concede)). To be better than my outside offer (770), I need:\n\u20030.9 \u00d7 (862 \u2013 conceded) \u2265 770  \n=> 862 \u2013 conceded \u2265 770/0.9 \u2248 855.56  \n=> conceded \u2264 862 \u2013 855.56 \u2248 6.44\n\nGiven my values for each item (all single unit values exceed 6 if positive), the smallest concession I could make (e.g., giving 1 unit of any item) would cost me at least 28 (if that were item 3) or even more for any other item. That exceeds the allowed concession envelope by far. Thus, any positive concession would drop my outcome below my outside option.\n\nMy best counteroffer is therefore not to concede any items, i.e. offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. If Player 2 accepts that counteroffer in round 2, I would receive the full bundle worth a raw 862. Discounted by 0.9 that becomes 775.8, which is marginally above my outside offer of 770. Although it is a tough offer for Player 2, it ensures that I never end up below my guaranteed alternative.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 583. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 3, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I start by noting that the current offer on the table (Player 2\u2019s offer) would give me:\n\u2003\u2022 item1: 0 units \u2192 0 \u00d7 95 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 item2: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 92 = 184  \n\u2003\u2022 item3: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 22 = 44  \n\u2003\u2022 item4: 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 35 = 105  \n\u2003\u2022 item5: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 29 = 58  \n\u2003Total = 0 + 184 + 44 + 105 + 58 = 391  \nSince we are in round 2 and the outcome is discounted by \u03b3 = 0.9, the effective value would be 391 \u00d7 0.9 = 351.9. This is well below my outside offer of 583 (which is not subject to discount). \n\nTo improve my outcome, I must counter so that (if a deal is reached now) the undiscounted value I get is high enough that after applying the 0.9 discount I beat my reservation of 583. In particular, if V is the undiscounted value of what I keep, then V \u00d7 0.9 should be \u2265583 so I need V \u2265583/0.9 \u2248 648. I want to secure as many of the high\u2010value items for myself. My per\u2013unit values are highest on items 1 and 2 (95 and 92, respectively) and relatively lower on items 3 (22), 4 (35) and 5 (29). \n\nRecall the totals per item are: [5, 4, 5, 3, 5]. In a counteroffer I propose an allocation \u201coffer\u201d [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5] that is given to Player 2. I then keep [5 \u2013 x1, 4 \u2013 x2, 5 \u2013 x3, 3 \u2013 x4, 5 \u2013 x5]. My previous round 1 offer was [0, 0, 5, 3, 5] (giving away all of items 3, 4, and 5) so that I kept the valuable items 1 and 2 and ended up with:  \n\u2003item1: 5 \u2192 5 \u00d7 95 = 475  \n\u2003item2: 4 \u2192 4 \u00d7 92 = 368  \nTotal = 843 (and discounted value 843\u00d70.9 \u2248758.7).  \n\nHowever, Player 2\u2019s current offer is different. To help sway Player 2 toward agreement while still keeping a strong outcome for myself, I can \u201csweeten\u201d the deal a little bit for them by giving up 1 unit of item 2 (which is high for me, but I\u2019m willing to concede slightly to make the offer more attractive). \n\nThus I propose a counteroffer giving Player 2:  \n\u2003item1: 0,  \n\u2003item2: 1,  \n\u2003item3: 5,  \n\u2003item4: 3,  \n\u2003item5: 5.  \n\nThen I would keep:  \n\u2003item1: 5 (worth 5\u00d795 = 475),  \n\u2003item2: 4 \u2013 1 = 3 (worth 3\u00d792 = 276),  \n\u2003item3: 0,  \n\u2003item4: 0,  \n\u2003item5: 0.  \nMy total value becomes 475 + 276 = 751 (undiscounted) and then discounted it is 751\u00d70.9 \u2248 676, which beats my outside offer of 583. This offer gives Player 2 all units of items 3, 4, and 5 (which might be attractive if they value these items) plus 1 unit of item2.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 270. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 558 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

(Our outside option is 1392.) In any accepted deal our share (the items we keep) must be worth at least 1392. Since our share (if we got everything) is 1486, the \u201cconcession\u201d we can allow ourselves is at most 1486 \u2013 1392 = 94 in our own value.\n\nBecause our private value for item1 is only 11 per unit (the lowest among available items), any units of item1 we concede hurt us the least. In contrast, giving up even one unit of a higher\u2010value item (like item2 or item4 at 95 each or item5 at 91 each) would be much more costly in terms of our outcome. In fact, if we were to give all 7 units of item1, our concession cost is 7\u00d711 = 77 (which is within our 94 \u201cbudget\u201d), leaving us with items worth 1486 \u2013 77 = 1409 \u2013 a bit above our outside offer. (We cannot \u201cmix\u201d items to get exactly 94 without exceeding our available units; the lowest\u2010cost concession is to give item1.)\n\nThus, in order to leave ourselves a final share safely above our alternative while giving the other player something (albeit only low\u2010value items for us), my initial counteroffer is to offer all 7 units of item1 to Player 2 and keep all the rest.

That totals a raw (undiscounted) value of\n\n\u2003\u20030\u00d75 + 1\u00d758 + 0\u00d72 + 0\u00d740 + 1\u00d720 = 78\n\nIn round\u00a02 the outcome will be discounted by a factor of 0.9 so its \u201cpresent value\u201d would be 78\u00d70.9 = 70.2. This is far below my outside option of 113.\n\nThus, I must counteroffer. In choosing a counteroffer, I want a final deal (after discounting) that beats 113. (For instance, if I get retained items of \u201craw\u201d total value V, then in round\u202f2 the effective payoff is 0.9\u00d7V. So I\u2019d need V \u2265 113/0.9 \u2243 125.6 to be better than walking away.) Looking at my values\u2014\n\u2003\u2022 item\u00a02 is very valuable (58 per unit) \n\u2003\u2022 item\u00a04 is also valuable (40 per unit)\nwhile items\u00a01, 3, and 5 are relatively lower in my eyes (5, 2, and 20, respectively).\n\nSo I want to keep the entire stocks of item\u00a02 and (most of) item\u00a04 to get a high payoff. One strategy is to \u201caward\u201d the opponent all of the items I care less about and only concede a little on one of the higher\u2010value ones (to help induce agreement). For example, consider the following division of the 5 types of items (total available: [4, 2, 5, 2, 4]):\n\n\u2022 I offer Player\u00a02:\u2003[4, 0, 5, 1, 3]\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Check that these numbers don\u2019t exceed totals (they don\u2019t).\n\u2022 I keep the remainder:\u2003[4\u20134, 2\u20130, 5\u20135, 2\u20131, 4\u20133] = [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nMy retained items have a raw total value of:\n\u2003\u20030\u00d75 + 2\u00d758 + 0\u00d72 + 1\u00d740 + 1\u00d720 = 0 + 116 + 0 + 40 + 20 = 176\n\nWhen discounted in round\u00a02, the value would be 0.9\u00d7176 = 158.4, which is well above my outside guarantee of 113. (I\u2019m giving up almost all of the lower\u2010value items while retaining all of item\u00a02 and a large share of item\u00a04.)\n\nBased on this calculation I choose to counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 5, 1, 3]}",

In any deal I propose I must ensure that the share I keep (using my own private per\u2010unit values) comes to at least 568; that is, the \u201ccost\u201d (in my own lost value) of the items I give to Player\u00a02 must be no more than 681\u2013567 = 114. (In round\u202f1 no discount applies.) I want, however, to give Player\u00a02 a bundle that, although \u201ccheap\u201d from my view, might still be attractive to them. Since my per\u2013unit values are:  \n\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a01: 20  \n\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a02: 28  \n\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a03: 95  \n\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a04: 54  \n\u2003 \u2022 Item\u00a05: 15  \nI prefer not to give away any of the highest\u2010valued items (items\u00a03 and 4) since I get a lot from them. Instead I can use the \u201ccheaper\u201d items where my loss per unit is lower. In my valuation item\u00a05 is the cheapest (15 per unit) and I can afford to give all 3 available (cost = 3\u00d715 = 45). That leaves me with an \u201callowance\u201d of 114 \u2013 45 = 69 \u201cpoints\u201d of cost to use on the remaining types. Among them, item\u00a01 (at 20 per unit) is lowest; using 2 or 3 units is possible. One way is to use 2 units from item\u00a01 (cost = 2\u00d720 = 40) and, if possible, \u201cspend\u201d the remaining 69 \u2013 40 = 29 points on an item where my cost is about 28 (namely item\u00a02). That gives an extra 1 unit of item\u00a02 (cost = 28). Altogether, then, the \u201clost value\u201d allocated is 40 + 28 + 45 = 113, which leaves me with a payoff of 681 \u2013 113 = 568 \u2013 just above my alternative. In this proposed division I offer Player\u00a02:  \n\u2003 \u2022 2 units of item\u00a01  \n\u2003 \u2022 1 unit of item\u00a02  \n\u2003 \u2022 0 units of item\u00a03  \n\u2003 \u2022 0 units of item\u00a04  \n\u2003 \u2022 3 units of item\u00a05  \nand I keep the remaining items for myself. (That is, I keep 4 of item\u00a01, 1 of item\u00a02, all 2 of item\u00a03, all 5 of item\u00a04, and 0 of item\u00a05.) This outcome gives me a value of:  \n\u2003 4\u00d720 + 1\u00d728 + 2\u00d795 + 5\u00d754 = 80 + 28 + 190 + 270 = 568  \nwhich exceeds my outside offer of 567. Although, from my perspective, Player\u00a02\u2019s resulting bundle may \u201ccost\u201d me only 113 points of my value, they receive a number of units (in my count 2+1+3 = 6 items) that might be appealing given their own private values. (I do not know those exactly, but by offering an allocation with some \u201cgenerosity\u201d on items that are relatively \u201ccheap\u201d to me, I try to induce agreement.)  \n\nThus, my chosen action is to make the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2,1,0,0,3]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 66 for item 1, 17 for item 2, 71 for item 3, 65 for item 4, 9 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 924. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 877. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 877. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on my action, let's evaluate the offer made by Player 1 and its value compared to my outside offer:\n\nCurrent offer to Player 1: [2, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n\n**Calculating the value of my shares:**\n- I get 6 - 2 = 4 units of item 1, which is worth 4 \u00d7 66 = 264.\n- I get 2 - 1 = 1 unit of item 2, which is worth 1 \u00d7 17 = 17.\n- I get 2 - 0 = 2 units of item 3, which is worth 2 \u00d7 71 = 142.\n- I get 5 - 0 = 5 units of item 4, which is worth 5 \u00d7 65 = 325.\n- I get 3 - 3 = 0 units of item 5, which is worth 0 \u00d7 9 = 0.\n\nTotal value of the current offer to me = 264 + 17 + 142 + 325 + 0 = 748.\n\nMy outside offer is 877, which is higher than the value of the current offer (748), even before applying the discount factor. Given this, I should not accept the current offer, as its value is less than my outside offer.\n\n**Considering a counteroffer:**\nTo make a counteroffer, I need to ensure that the value to me exceeds my outside offer of 877.\n\nLet's reconsider the distribution:\n- If I give Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 2], what do I keep?\n\n**Value of items I keep:**\n- For item 1: 6 - 1 = 5, so 5 \u00d7 66 = 330.\n- For item 2: 2 - 0 = 2, so 2 \u00d7 17 = 34.\n- For item 3: 2 - 0 = 2, so 2 \u00d7 71 = 142.\n- For item 4: 5 - 0 = 5, so 5 \u00d7 65 = 325.\n- For item 5: 3 - 2 = 1, so 1 \u00d7 9 = 9.\n\nTotal value of my counteroffer to me: 330 + 34 + 142 + 325 + 9 = 840.\n\nThe counteroffer value (840) is still below my outside offer value of 877, but it's much higher than the current offer of 748. However, without knowing Player 1's valuation, ensuring I get above 877 directly in terms of a counteroffer value seems challenging unless Player 1 is willing to give up very valuable resources.\n\nGiven the threshold of needing 877 in value to myself and inability to guarantee this with a straightforward counteroffer while still needing to provide sufficient to player 1 to consider a deal based on likely unknown valuations and interest across item types, the best decision here may be to avoid risking ending on a sub-optimal deal when a guaranteed outside offer represents a better confirmed value. Hence, strategically the appropriate response may be to walk away at this point to safely secure the 877 outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my decision is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
