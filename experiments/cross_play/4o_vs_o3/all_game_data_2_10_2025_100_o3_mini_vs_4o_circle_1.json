I need to offer enough to entice Player 1 to consider my counteroffer.\n\nLet's propose:\n\n- Item 1: Offer 0 units (I keep 3 units, maximizing my highest value)\n- Item 2: Offer 0 units (I keep 3 units, maximizing another high value)\n- Item 3: Offer 0 units (I keep 2 units, maximizing another high value)\n- Item 4: Offer 6 units (I value these the least)\n- Item 5: Offer 3 units (I value these the least)\n\nThis offer maximizes my high-value items and fully pushes low-value items to Player 1.\n\n### Counteroffer Response:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 6, 3]}",

Since walking away guarantees me 832, it would be unwise to accept the current offer. \n\n**Strategy for Counteroffer:**  \n\nTo make a beneficial counteroffer, I need to maximize the value of the items I keep based on my valuations, while considering a fair distribution that Player 1 might find acceptable. I'll take a more aggressive approach since the first offer was very unfavorable for me. \n\n**My Valuations (for all items):**  \n- Item 1: 8 units * 88 = 704  \n- Item 2: 2 units * 81 = 162  \n- Item 3: 2 units * 83 = 166  \n- Item 4: 3 units * 44 = 132  \n- Item 5: 5 units * 61 = 305  \n- Total valuation = 704 + 162 + 166 + 132 + 305 = 1469  \n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that keeps most of the higher-valued items with me but also concedes enough that Player 1 might accept in a future round. My key interest is in items 1, 3, and 5.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal [to Player 1]:**  \n- Item 1: 3 units  \n- Item 2: 0 units  \n- Item 3: 0 units  \n- Item 4: 2 units  \n- Item 5: 2 units  \n\n**Items I would keep:**  \n- Item 1: 5 units  \n- Item 2: 2 units  \n- Item 3: 2 units  \n- Item 4: 1 unit  \n- Item 5: 3 units  \n\n**Value of My Counteroffer for Me:**  \n- Item 1: 5 units * 88 = 440  \n- Item 2: 2 units * 81 = 162  \n- Item 3: 2 units * 83 = 166  \n- Item 4: 1 unit * 44 = 44  \n- Item 5: 3 units * 61 = 183  \n- Total Value = 440 + 162 + 166 + 44 + 183 = 995\n\nThis counteroffer value of 995 exceeds my outside offer, making it acceptable for me.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's evaluate the current offer and compare it with my outside offer and potential counteroffers.\n\n### Evaluation of Current Offer:\n\nThe offer on the table is [1, 2, 1, 4, 2], meaning:\n- I get 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 5.\n- Player 1 gets 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 4.\n\nCalculate the value of the items I'm receiving:\n- Item 1: 2 units * 16 value/unit = 32\n- Item 3: 1 unit * 25 value/unit = 25\n- Item 5: 2 units * 37 value/unit = 74\n\nTotal value from current offer = 32 + 25 + 74 = 131\n\nSince there are 3 rounds and this is the first round, the discount factor is \\( \\gamma^0 = 1 \\). Therefore, my total negotiated value right now is 131.\n\n### Comparison with Outside Offer:\n\nMy outside offer is 213.\n\n### Decision:\n\n- The current offer provides me with a value of 131, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 213. Therefore, accepting the current offer is not beneficial compared to walking away.\n- Walking away guarantees me 213.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy:\n\nTo make a counteroffer, I need to ensure that my value is maximized while staying within a realistic chance of acceptance by Player 1. \n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I propose to receive more of the high-value items (items 4 and 5) while being fair:\n- I could give Player 1 fewer units of items 4 and 5, as these add the most value to me.\n  \nCounteroffer: [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n- Player 1 receives 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n  \nThis means:\n- I receive 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n  \nCalculate the revised value:\n- Item 1: 2 units * 16 = 32\n- Item 2: 1 unit * 36 = 36\n- Item 3: 1 unit * 25 = 25\n- Item 4: 3 units * 46 = 138\n- Item 5: 3 units * 37 = 111\n\nTotal value from revised offer = 32 + 36 + 25 + 138 + 111 = 342\n\n### Action:\n\nGiven this, making a counteroffer with these units optimizes my chances as it gives me higher value compared to both the current offer and the outside offer. It also gives Player 1 a fair portion of items to consider.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 8, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 8, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on the best action in this negotiation, we need to evaluate the current offer from Player 1 and compare it to our private outside offer as well as our desire to maximize the value we receive.\n\n### Current Offer Evaluation:\n- **Item 3:** 8 units at a value of 59 per unit = \\(8 \\times 59 = 472\\)\n- **Item 5:** 4 units at a value of 13 per unit = \\(4 \\times 13 = 52\\)\n  \nThe total value of Player 1's current offer to us is \\(472 + 52 = 524\\).\n\n### Discounted Value:\nBecause this is the first round, the discount factor has not been applied yet (i.e., \\(0.9^0 = 1\\)). So the value remains 524.\n\n### Private Outside Offer:\nOur private outside offer is 618. Since the outside offer is greater than the current offer's value of 524, accepting this deal would be less beneficial than simply walking away.\n\n### Counteroffer Consideration:\nTo justify making a counteroffer, my offer needs to potentially yield me a higher value than my outside offer of 618 or improve the negotiation dynamics. Here's what is currently available overall:\n\n- Item 1: 5 units\n- Item 2: 5 units\n- Item 3: 8 units (all offered to me)\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 5 units\n\nGiven Player 1's initial offer, it's clear they may not value items 3 and 5 as much, or they consider them less strategically important (since they have offered all units of Item 3 and most of Item 5). Items with high values for me (like Item 4 and Item 1) could make a significant impact if I receive more of them. However, without knowing Player 1's valuations, we need a strategic move to potentially land a better deal for the next round.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer:\nA reasonable counteroffer could try to secure all of Item 4 since it's particularly important to us (value 82), and it results in a high increase of value. Additionally, retaining at least some units of Item 3 and Item 5 that provide substantial value or finding a balanced division could aid in negotiation. \n\nTo ensure it is above 618, we tentatively counter with:\n- Item 1: 0 (not offering any)\n- Item 2: 0 (not offering any)\n- Item 3: 4 (offering half)\n- Item 4: 0 (keeping all)\n- Item 5: 2 (offering less)\n\n### Counteroffer Evaluation for above split:\n- **Remaining Item 3:** 4 units \\(\\times 59 = 236\\)\n- **All of Item 4:** 3 units \\(\\times 82 = 246\\)\n- **Remaining Item 5:** 3 units \\(\\times 13 = 39\\)\n\nThe value of items retained in this scenario to us \\(= 236 + 246 + 39 = 521\\).\n\nThe above setup remains lesser than the outside offer after counteroffering, thus needs adjustment instead!\n\nOptimize to slightly modify holdings:\n\n- **Adjusted Counteroffer: [0, 0, 8, 0, 3]**\n    \nWith this split, we reevaluate, giving all of **Item 5**:\n\n- **Remaining Item 3**: 0 units\n- **All of Item 4:** 3 units \\(\\times 82 = 246\\)\n- **No Item 5 contribution**\n\nAlbeit, challenging to boost above 618 and if offering all of Item 3 and tweaking just concerning the units being held dims the last chance at acceptable valuation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe current proposition from Player 1 doesn't outweigh my outside offer and the practical offer revision doesn't surpass it constructively compelling enough.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

I should either walk away or make a counteroffer that increases my value. To attempt to achieve a better deal, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\n\nI will aim to secure a deal where I receive more valuable items while conceding less valuable ones. I prefer item 4 and item 5 due to their high values.\n\nHere\u2019s a potential counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 1: [4, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n  - I keep all units of item 4 (2 units) and item 5 (1 unit).\n  - This gives me maximum value from the high-value items.\n\n### Calculating My Offer Value\n\nMy counteroffer means I receive:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3 (leftover)\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nValue calculation:\n- Value from item 1 = 0 units \u00d7 51 = 0\n- Value from item 2 = 0 units \u00d7 33 = 0\n- Value from item 3 = 3 units \u00d7 22 = 66\n- Value from item 4 = 2 units \u00d7 81 = 162\n- Value from item 5 = 1 unit \u00d7 96 = 96\n\nTotal value from my counteroffer = 0 + 0 + 66 + 162 + 96 = 324\n\nThis is actually the same as the current offer, so I need to revise this as to make it more strategic for a better future value. I will propose giving Player 1 more of my less valuable items to compensate for holding onto high-value item 4 and item 5.\n\nRevised counteroffer offer:\n\nFor maximum advantage, I offer:\n\n- Offer Player 1: [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n- I receive:\n  - 2 units of item 1 (value = 2*51 = 102)\n  - 3 units of item 2 (value = 3*33 = 99)\n  - 2 units of item 4 (value = 2*81 = 162)\n  - 1 unit of item 5 (value = 1*96 = 96)\n  \nRevised calculation:\n\n- Total value = 102 (item 1) + 99 (item 2) + 162 (item 4) + 96 (item 5) = 459\n\nThis value is greater than my outside offer (375), making it more advantageous than the initial proposed.\n\nThus, I choose to counteroffer with:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 6, 1]. This means:\n   - Item 1: 0 units\n   - Item 2: 0 units\n   - Item 3: 0 units\n   - Item 4: 6 units\n   - Item 5: 1 unit\n\n2. **My Valuation of the Offer:**\n   - Value of Item 4: 6 units * 95 = 570\n   - Value of Item 5: 1 unit * 50 = 50\n   - Total value to me: 570 + 50 = 620\n\n3. **Discounted Value:** Since it's the first round, the discount factor doesn't apply yet (gamma^0 = 1). So my current valuation of the offer is still 620.\n\n4. **Compare with Outside Offer:** \n   - My outside offer is 1325.\n\n5. **Decision:** The value of accepting the current offer (620) is significantly less than my outside offer (1325). Therefore, accepting this offer is not in my best interest.\n\n6. **Counterproposal Strategy:**\n   - I want to make a counteroffer that provides a value closer to my outside offer, aiming for at least 1325 or more after considering discounts in potential future rounds.\n   - I should balance giving up items that are less valuable to me in favor of items with higher values.\n\n7. **Propose Counteroffer:** \n   - Item 1: 0 units (high value to me, prefer keeping them)\n   - Item 2: 0 units (most valuable, keep all)\n   - Item 3: 2 units (least valuable to me, give away all)\n   - Item 4: 0 units (second most valuable, keep all)\n   - Item 5: 2 units (moderately valuable, can give up some)\n\nFormulating the counteroffer:\n\nGiven that I value 95 points per unit of item 4 and 50 per item of 5, it is important to hold onto as many of item 4 as possible. To maximize my value and incentivize Player 1, I aim to keep entire unit allocations of the most valuable item 4 as well as item 2 due to its high value.

My private values make that worth 1\u00d795 + 2\u00d73 + 1\u00d787 + 2\u00d778 + 2\u00d797 = 538. However, since we\u2019re in round 2 the outcome is discounted by 0.9, so its present\u2010value for me is 538\u00d70.9 = 484.2. This is lower than my outside option of 514.\n\u2022 Therefore I must counteroffer for a deal that gives me a \u201craw\u201d value high enough so that (raw value)\u00d70.9 > 514 (i.e. raw value > 514/0.9 \u2248 571), while also leaving Player 2 something they might want to accept rather than walk away.\n\u2022 My items have very different values to me. I highly value item 1 (95 per unit), item 3 (87 per unit), item 4 (78 per unit) and item 5 (97 per unit); only item 2 (3 per unit) is quite low. Thus, I want to keep almost all of items 1, 3, 4, and 5 for myself and \u201cconcede\u201d item 2.\n\u2022 One possibility is to propose giving Player 2 all of item 2 (6 units) while giving them a modest share of the remaining items. For example, if I offer Player 2:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 2 units,\n\u2003\u2003item 2: all 6 units,\n\u2003\u2003item 3: 1 unit,\n\u2003\u2003item 4: 2 units,\n\u2003\u2003item 5: 2 units,\nthen my allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 5\u20132 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003item 2: 6\u20136 = 0,\n\u2003\u2003item 3: 3\u20131 = 2,\n\u2003\u2003item 4: 3\u20132 = 1,\n\u2003\u2003item 5: 3\u20132 = 1.\nCalculating my raw value:\n\u2003\u20033\u00d795 + 0\u00d73 + 2\u00d787 + 1\u00d778 + 1\u00d797 = 285 + 0 + 174 + 78 + 97 = 634.\nDiscounted at round 2: 634\u00d70.9 = 570.6, which just beats my outside offer.\n\u2022 This counteroffer is a moderate concession: Player 2 gets extra units of item 2 (which is of low value for me and likely more acceptable if their preferences differ) and some extra from items 1 and 4. It is also noticeably better for me than the current offer.\n\u2022 Based on these calculations, I propose the counteroffer [2, 6, 1, 2, 2] (meaning I give Player 2 that many units of each item; I receive the remainder).\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2,6,1,2,2]}",

I will prioritize retaining a higher quantity of these.\n- I need to keep more items of high value to approach or exceed the outside offer value.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that maximizes our interests:\n- Give Player 1 less of the higher-value items and try to test if they would accept more low-value items to me.\n\nProposed Counteroffer:\n- I propose [1, 3, 0, 2, 2] to Player 1.\n\nNow let's calculate my retained value from this counteroffer:\n- I retain (5 - 1) = 4 units of item 1: 4 * 77 = 308\n- I retain (6 - 3) = 3 units of item 2: 3 * 74 = 222\n- I retain (3 - 0) = 3 units of item 3: 3 * 80 = 240\n- I retain (3 - 2) = 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 2 = 2\n- I retain (3 - 2) = 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 58 = 58\n\nTotal value if my counteroffer is accepted:\n= 308 + 222 + 240 + 2 + 58 = 830\n\nAdjusted value (discounted for round 2):\n= 830 * 0.9^1 = 747\n\nThis is still less than 914, but I have tried to maximize value and test Player 1's flexibility.

Walking away ensures I receive 696. However, I can propose a counteroffer aiming to maximize my potential value.\n\nI\u2019ll create a counteroffer where I aim to keep all of the high-value items: item 1, item 2, and item 3, since these give me the most value.\n\nLet's create a counteroffer:\n\n- Keep all 6 units of Item 1 (Value: 6 * 83 = 498)\n- Keep all 5 units of Item 2 (Value: 5 * 74 = 370)\n- Offer all 2 units of Item 3 to Player 1 (Value: 2 * 60 = 120)\n- Offer all 4 units of Item 4 to Player 1 (Value: 4 * 2 = 8)\n- Offer all 6 units of Item 5 to Player 1 (Value: 0 * 35 = 0) \n\nTotal value for me with this counteroffer = 498 + 370 = 868\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of 868, which is greater than walking away with 696, even after considering future discounting it remains lucrative.

The total value of the current offer to me is 426, which is less than my guaranteed outside offer of 540.\n2. With the discount rate of 0.9, I am currently in round 1. Therefore, the value needs to remain at least 540 to make me indifferent between accepting an offer and walking away. The current offer must be improved to match at least 600 (since 600 \u00d7 0.9^0 = 600, and closer to 540 when considering the discount rate for the future values).\n\n### Strategy\nGiven that the current offer does not meet my minimum acceptable value of 540 when adjusted for the discount rate, I must make a counteroffer that increases the value to me. \n\nLet's formulate a counteroffer:\n- I will attempt to get a more favorable split of the items, particularly the ones with higher value to me (i.e., items 1, 3, and 4).\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal**:\n- Maintain some balance while pushing for higher valued items for me: \n- I propose Player 1 receives [1, 4, 1, 0, 5], which results in my receiving [3, 3, 3, 2, 3].\n\n**Calculations for Revised Counteroffer**:\n- **Revised Offer To Me**: [3, 3, 3, 2, 3]\n  - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 48 = 144\n  - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 39 = 117\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 69 = 138\n  - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 42 = 126\n- **Total Value** of Revised Offer: 144 + 15 + 117 + 138 + 126 = 540\n\nThis revised offer matches my outside offer value of 540 without considering the discount rate and should therefore be acceptable given the game rules for optimality before applying discounts.\n\n### Conclusion\nI will propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 1, 0, 5]}\n```",

My outside offer is 367, so any deal that I agree to must be at least as attractive as that guarantee. Since my strongest values are on items\u202f1, 2, and 5, while items\u202f3 and 4 are relatively \u201ccheap\u201d for me (and may be worth more to the other player, whose values are unknown but drawn uniformly from 1 to 101), a natural starting move is to keep all of my high\u2010value items and offer the other player all of items\u202f3 and 4. In numbers, that means I propose that Player 2 receives all 7 units of item\u202f3 and all 4 units of item\u202f4, while I keep all 5 units of item\u202f1, 4 units of item\u202f2 and all 3 units of item\u202f5.

In order to maximize our own outcome, we prefer to retain the high\u2010value items.\n2.

By offering all the units of items 1 (4 units), 2 (5 units), and item 3 (1 unit) to Player\u00a02, we leave ourselves with items 4 (2 units) and 5 (8 units).

However, any counteroffer must maximize my value beyond 472 to be worthwhile.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy:\nTo make an attractive counteroffer to Player 1 which increases my value significantly above 472 and potentially benefits both, I need to acquire more high-value items for myself. Given my high value for item 4, I will focus on getting all units of it while allowing Player 1 substantial items as well.\n\nI will propose:\n- Offering Player 1 more units of item 3 and some units they have not claimed, while I secure the high-value item 4.\n\nProposed Counteroffer to Player 1: [1, 3, 3, 0, 3]\n- Player 1 gets: 1 of Item 1, 3 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, and all of Item 5\n- I get: All of Item 4, which I value at 297 alone, plus additional value from retained items.\n\n### My Calculation with Counteroffer:\n- Retain: \n   - 3 of Item 1: 3 * 30 = 90\n   - 1 of Item 3: 1 * 83 = 83\n   - 3 of Item 4: 3 * 99 = 297\n\nTotal value from counteroffer: 90 + 83 + 297 = 470\n\nI revise to ensure I'm getting at least 473 total, therefore slightly less value but a balance closer than walking away is attractive.\n\n### Revised Counteroffer\n\nReassessing the offer based on the above calculation logic:\n\n- Offer Player 1 [1, 0, 2, 0, 3]\n  - Player 2h's basket currently retains:\n    - 3 of Item 1: 3 * 30 = 90\n    - 3 of Item 3: 3 * 83 = 249\n    - 3 of Item 4: 3 * 99 = 297\n   \nTotal Value: 90 + 249 + 297 = 636\n\nThis ensures that value accrued after disounts is worthwhile.\n\nGiven constraints of balance, I will finalize the offer with proposed changes:\n\nThe counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 3]}\n```\nThis structure works more for both parties effectively while increasing my likelihood as it lies better within the limit of my presented second offer, above the value and just within the capability for further negotiations.",

My own total possible value is 1097 while my outside offer is 382, so any deal I agree to must be worth more than 382 to me. My private per\u2010unit values are highest on item 2 (92), item 3 (74), item 4 (87) and a bit lower on item 1 (46) and item 5 (70). (In fact, for me the \u201ccheapest\u201d item is item 1.) Since I do not know Player 2\u2019s private prices\u2014but they are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101\u2014I expect their \u201caverage\u201d per\u2010unit value to be roughly 51. This means that if I give over items that I value relatively little (like item 1) and perhaps a \u201cbonus\u201d unit of an item to boost their total, I can \u201cincentivize\u201d them to agree immediately.\n\nOne reasonable idea is to give Player 2 all 3 units of item 1. That \u201ccosts\u201d me 3\u00d746 = 138 but (if we assume an average value of 51 for Player 2) is worth roughly 3\u00d751 = 153 to them. However, giving them only item 1 would yield an expected total of about 153\u2014far too low relative to an expected outside offer (roughly half of their maximum possible total and likely in the 380\u2013400 range). So I add some extra \u201cincentive\u201d: giving them some units of an item I could sacrifice. I pick one unit of item 3 (worth 74 to me, and on average 51 to them) and all 3 units of item 4 (worth 87 each to me but again about 51 each for them) plus the only unit available of item 5. In total, this package is:\n\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 units  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 1 unit  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 units  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 unit\n\nUnder this offer Player 2 would receive an expected \u201ctotal value\u201d of roughly 3\u00d751 + 1\u00d751 + 3\u00d751 + 1\u00d751 = 8\u00d751 = 408 (if their private numbers are near the mean). That is likely enough to beat their reservation (outside offer) while keeping the high\u2010value items (like both units of item 2 and most of item 3) for me. In this proposal, my own share becomes the items left over:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: both units (2\u00d792 = 184) and  \n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 5 remaining units (5\u00d774 = 370),\nso my total value is 184 + 370 = 554, which is well above my outside offer of 382.\n\nThus, my initial offer is:\n\u2003[3, 0, 1, 3, 1]\n\nI now submit my counteroffer in the required format.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 1, 3, 1]}",

The current offer gives me value 370, which is less than my outside offer, making it unattractive given there is no discounting in the first round.\n\n**Counteroffer Considerations:**\n- I should aim to increase my total value received or secure the offer if Player 1 can propose a valuable counter that surpasses my outside option.\n  \n**Value Maximization Strategy:**\n- My maximum potential value from all items is 1284.\n- Consider proposing a counteroffer that values higher than 383 to beat my outside offer and negotiate towards maximizing my value.\n\n**Propose a Counteroffer:**\n- I will counteroffer [1, 0, 3, 1, 0]. This means I am offering Player 1:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\n**My Potential Value from This Counteroffer:**\n- Receiving:\n  - 4 units of item 1: 4 * 40 = 160\n  - 5 units of item 2: 5 * 37 = 185\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 63 = 126\n  - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 36 = 108\n  - 8 units of item 5: 8 * 55 = 440\n\nTotal potential value = 160 + 185 + 126 + 108 + 440 = 1019\n\nThis new allocation gives me a potential value much higher than both the outside offer and the current offer on the table.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven these calculations, offering a counteroffer will maximize my outcome more advantageously.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

Our full-item value (using our private values) is 722, so we need to secure a division that guarantees us at least 492. Our items (and our per\u2010unit values) are:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 8 = 24\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 91 = 364\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 87 = 174\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 5 = 20\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 35 = 140\n\nA simple idea is to try and \u201cclaim\u201d those items that have higher values for us while giving the other party some low\u2010value items (or items we care less about) such that they get enough benefit to prefer a deal over their outside offer. In our case the items we value most are items 2 and 3. For instance, if we keep all of items 2 and 3, we secure 538 points (4\u00d791 + 2\u00d787) which is above our fallback of 492.\n\nFor player 2, we must offer something that on average is attractive. We know nothing of their private values, but since their per\u2010unit values are drawn uniformly (and on average around 51 per unit) we want to leave them roughly enough items so that the expected sum (using 51 as a rough estimate) is not below their likely outside offer (roughly in the low-400s). By giving them all of items 1 and 4 plus a large portion of item 5 we\u2019re assigning them lower-value items (for us) but nevertheless a decent expected value. Comparing two possible splits:\n\u2003\u2013 If we offer them everything from items 1, 4, and 5, then we would keep only items 2 and 3 and end up with 538.\n\u2003\u2013 On the other hand, we can \u201cimprove\u201d our outcome by taking a unit of item 5 for ourselves and leaving them 3 units of item 5. This split gives us: items 2 (4 units) + items 3 (2 units) + 1 unit of item 5 which sums up to 364 + 174 + 35 = 573\u2014more than our fallback\u2014with player 2 receiving items 1 (3), item 4 (4), and 3 units of item 5. Their expected value in a rough sense is about 3+4+3 = 10 units \u00d7 51 \u2248 510, which should be attractive enough.\n\nThus, as our initial offer in round 1, we propose to give player 2:\n\u2003Item 1: 3 units,\n\u2003Item 2: 0 units,\n\u2003Item 3: 0 units,\n\u2003Item 4: 4 units,\n\u2003Item 5: 3 units.\n\nThis leaves us with:\n\u2003Item 1: 0,\n\u2003Item 2: 4,\n\u2003Item 3: 2,\n\u2003Item 4: 0,\n\u2003Item 5: 1,\nwhich totals 573 in our value. \n\nI now provide my action in the required JSON format.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 4, 3]}",

Hence, I would receive 0 of items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 1 of item 5.\n\n2. **Value of the Current Offer to Me:** \n   - I value item 5 at 71.\n   - So, the total value of the current offer to me is \\(1 \\times 71 = 71\\).\n\n3. **Current Round:** This is round 1. The discount factor is \\( \\gamma = 0.9\\). Therefore, there is no discount applied yet if we accept, since discount is applied as \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)}= \\gamma^0 = 1\\).\n\n4. **Comparing with Outside Offer:**\n   - My outside offer is 237.\n   - If I accept the current offer, my value is 71, which is less than my outside offer (237). Accepting this offer is not beneficial unless it exceeds my outside option when adjusted for rounds.\n\n5. **Make a Counteroffer:** Since the current offer is worth much less than my outside offer, I should create a counteroffer that maximizes my utility:\n\n   My private values:\n   - Item 1: 36\n   - Item 2: 45\n   - Item 3: 54\n   - Item 4: 31\n   - Item 5: 71\n\n   Total units available are important to note: \n   - Item 1: 4 \n   - Item 2: 5 \n   - Item 3: 4 \n   - Item 4: 1 \n   - Item 5: 3\n\n   I prioritize high-value items. Item 5 is my highest valued, but giving all might not work well with the opponent. Item 3 is also valuable to me. Trying to distribute fairly, I aim to keep significant item units.\n\n   To maximize my value, a fair offer could be:\n   - Item 1: 1 (giving them 3)\n   - Item 2: 2 (giving them 3)\n   - Item 3: 1 (giving them 3)\n   - Item 4: 0 (I try to take it since it's intermediate in order)\n   - Item 5: 1 (retaining 2 for higher personal gain)\n\n   Proposed offer: [3, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\nEvaluating proposed offer:\n   - My value if counter: \n     - Item 1: 1 unit \\(\\rightarrow 1 \\times 36 = 36\\)\n     - Item 2: 2 units \\(\\rightarrow 2 \\times 45 = 90\\)\n     - Item 3: 3 units \\(\\rightarrow 3 \\times 54 = 162\\)\n     - Item 4: 0 units \\(\\rightarrow 0 \\times 31 = 0\\)\n     - Item 5: 2 units \\(\\rightarrow 2 \\times 71 = 142\\)\n   - Total value = 36 + 90 + 162 + 0 + 142 = 430\n\n430 (from counteroffer) is much better than the initial 71 offer and sufficient over 237 considering negotiation tactics.

My outside option is only 7, so there is a lot of surplus available.\n\u2022 To \u201cprotect\u201d my highest\u2010valued items (especially item 4 \u2013 6 units at 98 each and item 1 \u2013 5 units at 70 each) I want to concede mostly in the items that matter less to me (items 5 and 3) while giving Player 2 just enough to make the offer at least as attractive as what he might expect by waiting (noting that he would be the proposer in round 2 but his discounted value would be roughly 0.9 times his full value).\n\u2022 A rough \u201cfair\u201d division (in equilibrium terms from our expected views) would be to give Player 2 roughly 47% of the total surplus. Using average values for Player 2 (e.g. an average valuation of roughly 51 per unit), a division that \u201csplits\u201d the items but adjusts for my own preferences suggests offering him the following:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1 (5 available): offer him 2 units (keeping 3 units, which I highly value).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2 (4 available): offer him 2 units.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3 (7 available): offer him 4 units (since my value is only 46 per unit while he on average might see them as closer to 51).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4 (6 available): offer him 2 units (I want to keep 4 because of high value 98).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5 (5 available): offer him all 5 units because these are my least valuable (29 each).\n\u2022 In my own valuation this leaves me with:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3\u00d770 = 210  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d756 = 112  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 3\u00d746 = 138  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 4\u00d798 = 392  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 0  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 210+112+138+392 = 852.\n\u2022 Estimating Player 2\u2019s value using an average of around 51 per unit gives him roughly:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d751 = 102  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d751 = 102  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 4\u00d751 = 204  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 2\u00d751 = 102  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 5\u00d751 = 255  \n\u2003\u2003Total \u2248 765.\n\u2022 Given that if the negotiation goes to a later round the discount (0.9) will lower future outcomes, this division is attractive enough for Player 2 to be tempted to accept in round 1 while leaving me (as proposer) with a slight advantage.\n\u2022 Therefore I make the following initial counteroffer, remembering that my offer numbers represent the units allocated to Player 2.\n\nMy action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 4, 2, 5]}",

In round 1, the discount factor does not affect the current offer since we are considering direct values.\n\n### Decision\nThe current offer from Player 1 is valued at 572 for me, which is substantially less than my outside offer of 977. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the current offer.\n\nTo improve the situation, I will make a counteroffer with the goal of increasing the value to me while providing a fair division to Player 1.\n\n### Counteroffer Construction\nI need to construct an offer that sufficiently maximizes my value while still being appealing to Player 1. \n\nConsidering Player 1 offered me a lot for item 1 and item 4, I can consider that they might have a relatively low value for these items. I will propose a counteroffer where I give them more of item 2, which has less value to me compared to item 3 and item 1.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer\nGiven that I want to maximize my own value but acknowledge that Player 1 might be willing to compromise:\n\n- 3 units of item 1 (keep most for myself)\n- 7 units of item 2 (since it seems of value to Player 1)\n- 0 unit of item 3 (retain all for myself)\n- 2 units of item 4 (keep some but concede some as they offered all)\n- 0 units of item 5 (retain all for myself)\n\nMy counteroffer will be [3, 7, 0, 2, 0].\n\nI am trying to secure the highest value items for myself while still making a slightly less appealing offer than what I can get alone. \n\nHence, the action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 7, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "To decide the best action, I need to evaluate the current offer and see if it's better than my outside offer, or determine a suitable counteroffer.\n\n### 1. Evaluating the Current Offer\n\nFirstly, calculate the value of the current offer from Player 1:\n\n- Item 1: 1 unit x 61 = 61\n- Item 2: 5 units x 46 = 230\n- Item 3: 1 unit x 50 = 50\n- Item 4: 2 units x 51 = 102\n- Item 5: 0 units x 42 = 0\n\n**Total value of the current offer = 61 + 230 + 50 + 102 + 0 = 443**\n\n### 2. Discounted Value Calculation\n\nSince we are in round 2, the present value of the offer is discounted by `gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9`. Hence, my net value for the current offer is:\n\n- **Discounted value = 443 * 0.9 = 398.7**\n\n### 3. Comparing to Outside Offer\n\n- My outside offer is 977.\n\n### 4. Decision Making\n\n- **The discounted value of the current offer (398.7) is much less than my outside offer (977).**\n- Therefore, accepting this offer is not beneficial.\n- Since we're in round 2, I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer. I need to maximize my value but can't exceed the total supply of each item.\n\n### 5. Proposing a Counteroffer\n\nTo make a successful counteroffer, I need to seek a division that provides me a net value higher than my outside offer while still being reasonable for Player 1 to consider along with their interests in previous offers.\n\nPrevious offers from Player 1 indicate they value item 2 highly. I'll make a counteroffer that gives them the majority of item 2 but keeps valuable items for myself:\n\n- Counteroffer to Player 1: [3, 7, 0, 1, 0]\n\nThis allocation gives me:\n\n- Item 1: 4 units x 61 = 244\n- Item 2: 1 unit x 46 = 46\n- Item 3: 5 units x 50 = 250\n- Item 4: 2 units x 51 = 102\n- Item 5: 3 units x 42 = 126\n\n**Total value to me from this counteroffer = 244 + 46 + 250 + 102 + 126 = 768**\n\nThe discounted present value for this round would be:\n\n- **Net value after discount = 768 * 0.9 = 691.2**\n\nThis value is still below my outside offer value but much improved. Strategically, this might push player 1 to propose something better in the final round that takes both interests more into account. However, I realize that I will only aim to maximize what I can get this round.\n\nTherefore, here is my counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 7, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

However, it remains significantly below the value of my outside offer.\n\nI need to make a realistic counteroffer that improves the distribution for me, aiming to approach my outside offer value, understanding that in the final round, choosing COUNTEROFFER is treated as a WALK.\n\n- I want to prioritize receiving items with higher values per unit. Given the current state, I should focus on asking for more of item 2 and item 4 due to their high value and reducing the units for others.\n\nCounteroffer Proposal:\n- I should aim to receive more units of the highest valued items.\n\nLet's propose:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis counteroffer retains higher quantities of item 4 and 2, ensuring that if accepted, my total received value will increase.\n\nExecuting this strategy:\n\nIf we give:\n- 2 of item 1\n- 2 of item 2\n- 4 of item 3\n- 4 of item 4\n- 3 of item 5 \n\nThis results in a counter offer of [2, 2, 4, 4, 3].\n\nThis proposal aims to significantly enhance my outcome without deviating too drastically. \n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven all these considerations:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 4, 4, 3]}\n```",

The value of this offer for me is 0.\n\n2. **Consider My Outside Offer:**\n   - My outside offer is valued at 226. If I decide to walk away, I receive precisely 226.\n\n3. **Evaluate a Counteroffer:**\n   - My objective is to propose a division of items that maximizes my value while still being acceptable to Player 1.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Value of All Items for Me:**\n   - Items available: 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - My values: 22 for item 1, 18 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 99 for item 4, 42 for item 5.\n   - Total potential value = (3 * 18) + (3 * 69) + (2 * 99) + (5 * 42) = 54 + 207 + 198 + 210 = 669.\n\n5. **Maximize My Value Through Counteroffer:**\n   - I will aim to secure high-value items, aiming for at least as much value as my outside offer after discounting.\n   - Prioritize items based on my valuation: Item 4, Item 3, Item 5, Item 2.\n\n6. **Formulate a Counteroffer:**\n   - Give Player 1 fewer high-value items to ensure my value is adequate.\n   - Tentatively offer: [0, 2, 1, 0, 3], giving me [0, 1, 2, 2, 2].\n\n7. **Calculate My Value from Counteroffer:**\n   - My value from this division: (1 * 18) + (2 * 69) + (2 * 99) + (2 * 42) = 18 + 138 + 198 + 84 = 438.\n   - Adjusted present value after discounting for round 1: Value * gamma^(r-1) = 438 * 0.9^0 = 438.\n\nThe counteroffer I consider provides a value significantly higher than my outside offer of 226, even after discount reduction in subsequent rounds.\n\n### Decision:\n\nGiven the analysis, I propose a counteroffer that steps through on a feasible division that heavily favors my value while still leaving room for Player 1 to accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 0, 3]}\n```",

Here's a balanced approach:\n\n- I will keep some high-value items for myself:\n  - Item 1: Propose 2 to Player 1 and keep 2 for myself.\n  - Item 2: Propose 1 to Player 1 and keep 1 for myself.\n  - Item 3: Irrelevant, as there are 0 units.\n  - Item 4: Propose 1 to Player 1 and keep 3 for myself.\n  - Item 5: Propose 1 to Player 1 and keep 1 for myself.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal**: [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nThis means:\n- I offer Player 1 a share such that they receive some value, while ensuring I extract a value that, if negotiations progress to the next round, won't fall below my outside offer even under the discounted value scenario.\n\nWith this rationale, my action is: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Compare with Outside Offer:\n\nMy outside offer is 966. Given the discount factor gamma = 0.9 and that this is round 1, no discount applies yet.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Accepting the current offer gives me a present value of 394.\n- Walking away gives me a guaranteed value of 966.\n\nThe value of the current offer is significantly lower than my outside option. Even factoring in any possible rounds with discounting, accepting an offer significantly lower than the outside offer doesn't work in my favor.\n\n### 3. Considering a Counteroffer:\n\nWith the need to increase my gained value significantly, I need a counteroffer that maximizes my value but might still be considered by Player 1:\n\n- I'll prioritize items with high personal values: item 1 (74), item 3 (75), item 5 (76). \n\nI'll construct a counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 1 a conservative amount of high-value items like item 3 and item 5 which I want more of.\n- Balance by giving a bit more of other lower-value items to even out or sweeten the pot.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer while reserving more valuable items:\n- Player 1: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2] (Offering them less of item 2 and item 5, no item 1, 3, and 4)\n\nThis counteroffer assumes Player 1 might see more value in items offered and potential value giving them space for their strategy.\n\n**Proposed Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

I will try to reduce the units of items with high value per unit to me that Player 1 takes, aiming for a total that exceeds my outside offer.\n\nAdjusting initially proposed values:\n\n- **Item 1:** Give Player 1 only 2 units - because this reduces my loss in lower-value item to me.\n- **Item 3:** This is most valuable to me, so Player 1 receives only 0 units.\n- **Keep item 2 as 0:** Maintain priority on valuable items\n- **Adjust Item 4 to 1 unit:** As item 4 is not as valuable to me.\n- **Item 5:** Player 1 receives 5 units \u2013 an item with moderate value to me but potentially strategic for them.\n\nRevising offer to Player 1:\n\nCounteroffer: [2, 0, 0, 1, 5]\n\n### Action\nFormulating the counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 1, 5]}\n```",

I need to make a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being reasonable enough for Player 1 to potentially accept.\n\nMy preferred strategy is to attempt to increase items with higher value to me: item 1, item 4, and item 5.

Since we want to maximize our own share, we want to give away as little (in our own valuation) as possible while still leaving something attractive for Player 2 so they have a reason to accept. Note that giving a unit of an item \u201ccosts\u201d us its per\u2010unit value. Our lowest cost units for us are from item 1 (28 per unit) and item 4 (33 per unit). We have some \u201cslack\u201d of 1338 \u2013 1234 = 104 value points we can concede.

You need a total offer value greater than 753 to motivate acceptance.\n\nLet's calculate a potential counteroffer:\n\n- **Value Needed for You:** Must exceed your outside offer value of 753.\n- **Let's consider offering Player 1 lesser priority items (consider leaving most of item 4 and maybe some item 5 with you).**\n\nHere's a balanced counteroffer:\n- Offer [0, 1, 0, 6, 1]:\n  - You keep: 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n  - Value from this counteroffer:\n    - Item 1: 6 units \u00d7 10 value/unit = 60\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 24 value/unit = 48\n    - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 90 value/unit = 180\n    - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 93 value/unit = 372\n    - Total value = 660\n\nThis doesn't yet reach the outside offer value of 753. Let's adjust:\n\n- Offer [0, 1, 0, 5, 1]:\n  - You keep: 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n  - Value from this counteroffer:\n    - Item 1: 6 units \u00d7 10 value/unit = 60\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 24 value/unit = 48\n    - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 90 value/unit = 270\n    - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 93 value/unit = 372\n    - Total value = 750\n\nThis still doesn't exceed the outside offer. An improvement is necessary.\n\n- **Final Counteroffer:** \n  - [0, 1, 0, 7, 0]:\n  - You keep: 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n  - Value from this counteroffer:\n    - Item 1: 6 units \u00d7 10 value/unit = 60\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 24 value/unit = 48\n    - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 90 value/unit = 90\n    - Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 93 value/unit = 465\n    - Total value = 663\n\nGiven the gap remains, to breach 753 while maintaining negotiation leverage, consider offering slightly more to reduce compromise: \n\nOffer 0, 1, 0, 7, 1 and analyze:\n\nHere's the action based on calculations:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"} \n\nReason: Without finding a feasible mix exceeding 753, outside offer remains optimal.

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I need to evaluate the current offer and compare it to my outside offer value, while also considering the potential benefits of making a counteroffer.\n\n### Calculating the Value of the Current Offer\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nLet's calculate the total value of this offer using my private values:\n- Value from item 1: \\(1 \\times 79 = 79\\)\n- Value from item 2: \\(1 \\times 19 = 19\\)\n- Value from item 3: \\(1 \\times 48 = 48\\)\n- Value from item 4: \\(4 \\times 96 = 384\\)\n- Value from item 5: \\(3 \\times 36 = 108\\)\n\nTotal value from current offer = \\(79 + 19 + 48 + 384 + 108 = 638\\)\n\n### Comparison with Outside Offer\n\nMy outside offer is valued at 710. Since my objective is to maximize my value, and since the current offer (638) is lower than the outside offer (710), accepting the current offer would not be beneficial.\n\n### Considering a Counteroffer\n\nIf I make a counteroffer, I must ensure that the potential value is higher than 710 after applying any discount for future rounds. In round 2, the value is multiplied by \\(\\gamma^{1-1} = 0.9\\).\n\nTo propose a beneficial counteroffer, I should aim to keep high-value items beneficial to me and offer lower-value or balanced partition to Player 1 for a higher overall value.\n\nAn alternative counteroffer strategy:\n- Keep all of item 4 (since its value is highest for me).\n- Offer a balanced number of other items, trying to keep an improved allocation for myself.\n\nHere's one potential counteroffer strategy:\n- Give Player 1: \n  - 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 2 units for myself)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 1 unit)\n  - 2 units of item 3 (keeping 2 units)\n  - No units of item 4 (keeping all 8 units for myself)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (keeping 2 units)\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 1, 2, 0, 3]\n\nThis allocation ensures I retain a substantial portion of my high-value items, increasing the chances that my gained value exceeds the outside offer after adjustments. \n\nLet's calculate what I'd receive:\n- Value from item 1: \\(2 \\times 79 = 158\\)\n- Value from item 2: \\(1 \\times 19 = 19\\)\n- Value from item 3: \\(2 \\times 48 = 96\\)\n- Value from item 4: \\(8 \\times 96 = 768\\)\n- Value from item 5: \\(2 \\times 36 = 72\\)\n\nTotal value I receive: \\(158 + 19 + 96 + 768 + 72 = 1113\\)\n\nDiscounted value (for decision-making in next round): \\(1113 \\times 0.9 = 1001.7\\)\n\nThis counteroffer could yield a discounted value of 1001.7 for me in later rounds, substantially higher than the outside offer. Hence, it might be more beneficial for me to propose this counteroffer now.\n\n### Decision\n\nBased on this analysis, I aim to maximize my value with a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 3]}\n```",

We will calculate our total value for this offer:\n- Item 1: 3 units * 98 value/unit = 294\n- Item 2: 2 units * 70 value/unit = 140\n- Item 3: 1 unit * 32 value/unit = 32\n- Item 4: 1 unit * 18 value/unit = 18\n- Item 5: 2 units * 55 value/unit = 110\n\nTotal value from current offer = 294 + 140 + 32 + 18 + 110 = 594\n\n### Adjusted Value Due to Discounting\nThis negotiation is in round 2, and gamma is 0.9. Therefore, the value for round 2 is \\(594 \\times 0.9 = 534.6\\).\n\n### Comparison with Outside Offer\nOur outside offer is 1045. Since 534.6 is less than 1045, accepting the current offer is not advantageous.\n\n### Formulating a Counteroffer\nLet's create a counteroffer that improves our own outcome while being within realistic negotiation parameters. We ideally want to retain more units of the more valuable items to us. Our aim is to beat the discounted value of our outside offer if possible.\n\n- We prefer retaining more of item 1 and item 2, as those have the highest value.\n- Let's make a counteroffer that improves our position while making concessions on less valuable items.\n\nPossible counteroffer: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n- Item 1: 5 units * 98 value/unit = 490 (Keeping 5, giving 2)\n- Item 2: 3 units * 70 value/unit = 210 (Keeping 3, giving 1)\n- Item 3: 1 unit * 32 value/unit = 32\n- Item 4: 1 unit * 18 value/unit = 18\n- Item 5: 2 units * 55 value/unit = 110 (Keeping 2, giving 1)\n\nThis would give us a proposed counteroffer value of \\(490 + 210 + 32 + 18 + 110 = 860\\).\n\n### Discounted Counteroffer Value\nWith the discount factor in play: \\(860 \\times 0.9 = 774\\).\n\n### Decision\n774, our discounted counteroffer value, is still lower than our outside offer of 1045. However, it improves our position significantly compared to the offer on the table (594 before discount and 534.6 after).\n\nGiven this analysis, despite the counteroffer's discounted value still being below our outside offer, it demonstrates good negotiation to obtain a more favorable deal relative to Player 1's current stance. However, given the large gap, WALK might still be the prudent decision unless we believe strongly in further negotiation rounds.\n\nGiven the constraints of our private outside offer being high, I will choose:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Although there is potential to negotiate a better offer in rounds 2 and 3, I must prioritize securing a value close to or above my outside offer.\n\n4. **Counteroffer Decision**:\n   - My goal should be to make a counteroffer that will encourage Player 1 to concede more value to me while staying reasonable so that negotiations progress.\n   - For a counteroffer to be acceptable in the next round to Player 1, it must be slightly more in their favor than a fair split. I'll aim to leave some leverage for future negotiation, trying to balance between being demanding and reaching an agreement.\n\n   Let's propose the following counteroffer:\n   - Offer Player 1: [3, 0, 2, 0, 3] (I keep 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5)\n\nNow I will issue a counteroffer based on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 0, 3]}\n```",

However, since this is the first round, my value from the negotiation does not yet need to be discounted for rounds.\n   - Current value of the offer from Player 1 is 512, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 806. Thus, accepting the current offer results in a loss compared to my fallback option.\n\n4. **Make a Counteroffer:**\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value closer to or beyond my outside offer adjusted for subsequent rounds.\n   - Aim to get higher values to attempt reaching or improving upon the 806 threshold necessary to at least match my outside offer value.\n\nLet's construct a reasonable counteroffer:\n\n- I want to maximize my values for high-value items (Items 1 and 4) which are most pivotal.\n- I will attempt to retain higher control over these items and adjust accordingly:\n  - Item 1: Offer 2 units to Player 1 (optimal reduction for parity)\n  - Item 2: Offer 1 units to Player 1 (retain value)\n  - Item 3: Offer 4 units to Player 1 (since I've 0 preference in the prior offer)\n  - Item 4: Offer 1 unit to Player 1 (retain more for myself)\n  - Item 5: Offer 2 units to Player 1 (a fair compromise)\n\nThus, I'll propose a counteroffer ensuring that the value to me surpasses the present offer while providing Player 1 a further chance to consider:\n\nCounteroffer structure: [2, 1, 4, 1, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 1, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "I want to \u201cpush\u201d Player\u00a02 toward a deal that barely beats what they might get from \u201cwalking\u201d (their outside offer). I know that if I end up \u201cwalking\u201d I would get my outside offer of 883 in value (and I must do better than that with a deal). My own values for the items are high\u2014especially on items 1, 2, and 5\u2014so I would prefer to keep most of those. At the same time, I know nothing precise about Player\u00a02\u2019s numbers except that (if their per\u2010unit values are uniformly drawn from 1 to 101) their average is about 51 per unit; overall when they get everything they\u2019d \u201cexpect\u201d roughly 20\u00d751 \u2248 1020 in value and (since their outside offer is drawn uniformly from 1 up to that total) their typical outside outcome is around half that (~510). (Remember that if we delay a round the outcome is discounted by 0.9, so time is \u201cexpensive\u201d for them.) \n\nThus, my thinking is: I want to give Player\u00a02 \u201cjust enough\u201d so that (in expectation) what they\u2019d receive from my offer is around (or a little above) 510 so that they are willing to settle immediately. But I also must retain enough high\u2010value items so that my own \u201ckept\u201d bundle is worth more than 883. The total maximum value I could get is 1593; so I can \u201cconcede\u201d up to 1593 \u2013 883 = 710 points in my own value.\n\nSince I don\u2019t want to give away too much of what I value highly, I focus on items that are \u201ccheaper\u201d for me (in my numbers) but may still be \u201cworth it\u201d to Player\u00a02. In my case item\u00a03 and item\u00a04 are my \u201ccheaper\u201d items (I value them at 64 and 39 per unit, respectively) while items 1, 2, and 5 are far more precious to me (valued at 91, 94, and 100). If I give Player\u00a02 all of items 3 and 4 (that is 6 units of item\u00a03 and 2 units of item\u00a04), my cost is \n\u2003\u20036\u00d764 + 2\u00d739 = 384 + 78 = 462.\nThis leaves me with enough \u201cbuffer\u201d (710 \u2013 462 = 248) to concede a little extra if needed. But even with these 8 units, if we assume Player\u00a02 \u201csees\u201d about 51 per unit on average, that bundle is worth about 8\u00d751 = 408. That is far below their likely outside offer. \n\nTo tip the balance I add a minimal concession from one of the higher\u2010valued items. I choose to give 2 units of item\u00a01 (costing me 2\u00d791 = 182) because the average \u201cworth\u201d for Player\u00a02 would add about 2\u00d751 = 102 to their share. The total \u201cconcession cost\u201d comes to 462 + 182 = 644, leaving me with a kept value of 1593 \u2013 644 = 949, safely above my outside offer of 883. Meanwhile, Player\u00a02, in expectation, would end up with a bundle valued roughly at 408 + 102 = 510 \u2013 a level that should be competitive with (or just slightly better than) what they expect from their outside option.\n\nThus, my initial offer is to give Player\u00a02:\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item\u00a01\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u00a02\n\u2003\u2022 6 units of item\u00a03\n\u2003\u2022 2 units of item\u00a04\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u00a05\n\nI keep the remainders:\n\u2003\u2022 3 units of item\u00a01\n\u2003\u2022 4 units of item\u00a02\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u00a03\n\u2003\u2022 0 units of item\u00a04\n\u2003\u2022 3 units of item\u00a05\n\nThis offer gives me 949 in my own value (well above 883) while trying to \u201cjust satisfy\u201d Player\u00a02\u2019s likely requirement. (Of course, much depends on what Player\u00a02\u2019s actual numbers are\u2014but this is my carefully \u201coptimized\u201d starting offer for round\u00a01.)\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 6, 2, 0]}",

Therefore, I must evaluate whether the deal is better than my outside offer.\n\n4. **Discount Factor:**\n   - In the first round, discount factor gamma = 1 (since r-1 = 0).\n   - Effective value of the offer in this round doesn't change, so it remains 242.\n\n5. **Decision:**\n   - The current offer's value (242) is significantly lower than my outside offer (835). Accepting this offer would be a bad choice, as it doesn't even come close to my outside option.\n   - Thus, it's preferable to either walk away or propose a counteroffer that could potentially yield a value closer to or greater than 835.\n\nGiven these points, I need to make a counteroffer that potentially maximizes my value closer to 835, at least, before any reduction due to future rounds.\n\n6. **Counteroffer Proposal Strategy:**\n   - Let's structure a counteroffer such that the total value I get is higher. Keeping high-value items like item 1 and item 5 is key, along with making an offer that leaves less valuable items for Player 1.\n\n7. **Counteroffer Calculation:**\n   - Given my high value attributes:\n     - I want to keep most units of item 1 and item 5.\n   - A potential counteroffer could be:\n     - [3, 1, 2, 0, 1] offered to Player 1\n\n   - This means I receive:\n     - 2 units of item 1: Value = 2 * 72 = 144\n     - 3 units of item 2: Value = 3 * 46 = 138\n     - 4 units of item 3: Value = 4 * 4 = 16\n     - 2 units of item 4: Value = 2 * 37 = 74\n     - 2 units of item 5: Value = 2 * 85 = 170\n   - Total counteroffer value for me: 144 + 138 + 16 + 74 + 170 = 542\n\nThe counteroffer will then try to maximize the gain for me by maintaining flexibility in the next round if not accepted, through negotiation progression adjustments with potential future negotiations. However, my current outside option would still make me reluctant to propose any significant last minute changes.\n\nGiven these considerations, my action is to make a calculated counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

As I am in round 1, I have the chance to propose a counteroffer to increase my value.\n\n4. **Strategy for counteroffer:**\n   - I aim to get a total value close to or above my outside offer, after considering potential acceptance in a later round with the discount factor.\n   - Prioritize high-value items: item 1 and item 2, as they have the highest value per unit for me.\n\nProposal for counteroffer:\n   - Offer to Player 1 less of the high-value items (items 1 and 2), while keeping close to their initial offer for other items, possibly to maintain attractiveness.\n\n5. **Formulate the counteroffer:**\n   - Item 1: offer 3 to Player 1, I keep 3 (my units: 3 * 80 = 240)\n   - Item 2: offer 2 to Player 1, I keep 4 (my units: 4 * 95 = 380)\n   - Item 3: offer 1 to Player 1, I keep 4 (my units: 4 * 5 = 20)\n   - Item 4: offer 1 to Player 1, I keep 1 (my units: 1 * 43 = 43)\n   - Item 5: offer 4 to Player 1, I keep 8 (my units: 8 * 46 = 368)\n\n   Total value from counteroffer if accepted = 240 + 380 + 20 + 43 + 368 = 1051\n\nWhile this is still less than my outside offer (1425), it aims to improve from the initial offer without risking a complete breakdown in negotiation.

Therefore, walking away is not favorable unless no better option exists.\n\n4. **Potential Counteroffer:**\n   Given my higher valuation for items 1 and 4, I should aim to receive more units of those. However, I need to suggest a counteroffer keeping fairness and my total value in mind, trying to maximize my value but still keeping it reasonable so Player 1 may accept.\n\n   Let's formulate a counteroffer maximizing my gain on items 1 and 4:\n   - Offer Player 1 less on item 5, where I have a lower valuation.\n   - Still provide reasonable allocation on item 2, which they seem to value since they have requested full units.\n\n   Proposed Counteroffer:\n   - [1, 2, 0, 2, 3] to Player 1:\n     - My shares: \n       - 2 units of item 1 (value: 2 * 70 = 140)\n       - 1 unit of item 2 (value: 1 * 10 = 10)\n       - 1 unit of item 3 (value: 1 * 11 = 11)\n       - 2 units of item 4 (value: 2 * 75 = 150)\n       - 5 units of item 5 (since 8 total units exist, 8 - 3 = 5) (value: 5 * 34 = 170)\n\n   Total value of this counteroffer for me = 140 + 10 + 11 + 150 + 170 = 481.\n\nConsidering the current offer is less favorable than the potential counteroffer value, I will proceed with the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 3]}",

In any accepted division, my \u201cshare\u201d (the items I keep, valued at my private numbers) must be worth at least 830 so that I do better than or equal my fallback.\n\n2.

However, in any deal the opponent must receive a bundle that gives him an outcome at least as good as his outside offer. (His values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 so his expected per\u2010unit value is roughly 51. In expectation his fallback is on the order of about one\u2013half of his maximal total, roughly 480\u2013490 in expected terms.)\n\n3. To convince him to accept a deal in round 1 (when there is no discount yet), he must get a bundle that in his eyes is at least as good as his outside offer. That typically means giving him items whose expected total \u201cmarket\u201d value is roughly 480 or higher. The cheapest items for me to sacrifice are those I value the least (in my case, item 4 at 30 per unit, next items 2 and 5 at 47 and 44 per unit, respectively). But even if I gave him only the cheapest \u2013 say, 4 units of item 4 (sacrifice = 4\u00d730 = 120) \u2013 his expected value would be only about 4\u00d751 = 204. To get him near his expected fallback (on the order of 480 or so), I would need to give him nearly 10 units (for example, 6 units of item 4 and a few extra units from other types). However, any such combination (even with the cheapest items) will cost me far more in my own valuation. In fact, since I can \u201cafford\u201d to lose at most 956 \u2013 830 = 126 in my own value, I cannot muster a bundle for the opponent that in his eyes is near his fallback value (since even 5 units of item 4 would have cost me 150, leaving me below 830).\n\n4. In other words, any division that gives player 2 what he would require (given his outside offer) necessarily reduces my share to below my fallback of 830. As a result, accepting any negotiated agreement would leave me worse off than simply \u201cwalking away\u201d to get 830.\n\n5. Since I can guarantee 830 for myself by taking the outside offer and I cannot design an offer in round 1 that both gives me more than 830 and makes player 2 accept (according to the rough expected values), my best move is not to risk entering a negotiation that will likely result in a deal inferior to my fallback.\n\nBased on these considerations, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",
