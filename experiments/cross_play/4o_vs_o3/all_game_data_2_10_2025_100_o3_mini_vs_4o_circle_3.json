                    "response": "To decide on the next action, let's go through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 573.\n   - **Values of the items involved:**\n     - Item 1: 59\n     - Item 2: 54\n     - Item 3: 63\n     - Item 4: 50\n     - Item 5: 42\n   - **Total pool of items:** There are 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - **Discount factor:** In the first round, the discount factor is \\(0.9^0 = 1\\), so the value is not discounted. Waiting for future rounds will reduce the value by multiplying with the discount factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]:**\n     - Value from item 1 = 1 unit * 59 = 59\n     - Value from item 2 = 1 unit * 54 = 54\n     - Value from item 3 = 0 units * 63 = 0\n     - Value from item 4 = 1 unit * 50 = 50\n     - Value from item 5 = 0 units * 42 = 0\n     - Total value = 59 + 54 + 50 = 163\n\n   The value of the current offer (163) is much lower than my outside offer value (573).\n\n   - **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n     Let's consider offering a counteroffer which better balances my value with respect to my outside offer.\n\n   A potential counteroffer can be to ensure my remaining items provide a total value higher than 573 possibly close to the maximum item values I want to retain as much about my item values as possible.\n\n   For instance, if I offer [0, 0, 2, 3, 2] to maximize keeping item 3 higher value:\n\n   - I keep: \n     - Item 1: 1 unit * 59 = 59\n     - Item 2: 3 units * 54 = 162\n     - Item 3: 2 units * 63 = 126\n     - Item 4: 3 units * 50 = 150\n     - Item 5: 1 unit * 42 = 42\n     - Total value = 59 + 162 + 126 + 150 + 42 = 539\n\n   This counteroffer has a total value of 539, which is close to my outside offer. However, it is below the 573 mark which is important.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 163, which is significantly less than my outside offer (573).\n   - Walking away gives me a guaranteed 573.\n   - My potential counteroffer needs to get as close as possible to 573 or to attempt getting slightly more value. Therefore, balancing a higher value on what I gain from high item value item number 3, remaining values of spread but small yielding an attempt to convince player 1, represents uncertainty whether much more can be added than that initial [1,1,0,1,0] scenario.\n\nThus, I should walk away to secure my outside offer value of 573, as both the current offer and the potential counteroffer don't exceed this value sufficiently.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, let's analyze and evaluate the current situation step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 746.\n   - **Values of the items involved:**\n     - Item 1: 39 per unit\n     - Item 2: 32 per unit\n     - Item 3: 44 per unit\n     - Item 4: 46 per unit\n     - Item 5: 92 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - 4 units of Item 1\n     - 10 units of Item 2\n     - 6 units of Item 3\n     - 6 units of Item 4\n     - 2 units of Item 5\n   - **Discount factor:** The discount factor, gamma, is 0.9. However, since this is the first round, the discount factor does not apply yet\u2014it only applies in greater rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer (from Player 1 to me) is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]:**\n     - 0 units of Item 1 = 0 \u00d7 39 = 0\n     - 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n     - 0 units of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n     - 0 units of Item 4 = 0 \u00d7 46 = 0\n     - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 \u00d7 92 = 0\n     - Total value if I accept = 32\n\n   The current offer value to me is only 32, which is far below my outside offer value of 746.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer does not make sense as its value (32) is significantly less than my outside offer (746).\n   - Walking away provides me with a guaranteed value of 746.\n   - Making a counteroffer could potentially gain me more than the outside offer. I need to ensure any proposal yields a value greater than 746. For this, let's propose a division favoring me while still being somewhat reasonable in a negotiation sense.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer where I maximize my value close to the worth of my outside offer. I'll give Player 1 fewer higher-value items:\n\n   - Give Player 1 [2 units of Item 1, 4 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 0 units of Item 5], keeping the rest:\n     - For me: 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n     - 6 units of Item 2 = 6 \u00d7 32 = 192\n     - 4 units of Item 3 = 4 \u00d7 44 = 176\n     - 4 units of Item 4 = 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n     - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 92 = 184\n     - Total value to me = 814\n\nBy making this counteroffer, the value to me is higher than my outside offer value, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 4, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 820. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 3, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

If we wait for future offers, in round 2 the overall value of the outcome would be multiplied by 0.9, reducing it by 10%.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **For the current offer (if any):**\n     - The current offer on the table is [3, 0, 0, 5, 0].\n     - Value to me if I accept: \n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 46 = 0\n       - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 96 = 0\n       - Total value if accepted = 60 + 0 + 0 + 45 + 0 = 105\n\n   - **How do these values compare to my outside offer value?**\n     - Total value of the current offer (105) is less than my outside offer (239).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - **Should I accept the current offer?**\n     - Since the value of the current offer (105) is less than my outside offer (239), accepting is not favorable.\n\n   - **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n     - Not yet, as it might be possible to negotiate a better deal.\n\n   - **Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n     - I should make a counteroffer that increases my value to above my outside offer of 239. \n\n   Considering all the units available and my values, a strategy could be to aim for items with higher value, while leaving some units of lower-valued items to Player 1. My values dictate focusing more on items 2 and 5.\n\n   **Counteroffer proposal:**\n   - Offer 0 units of item 1 to Player 1.\n   - Offer 3 units of item 2 to Player 1 (keeping 3 units for myself: 3 \u00d7 67 = 201).\n   - Offer 3 units of item 3 to Player 1.\n   - Offer 3 units of item 4 to Player 1 (keeping 2 units for myself: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18).\n   - Offer 0 units of item 5 to Player 1 (keeping 1 unit for myself: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96).\n\n   Calculating my total value for this counteroffer:\n   - Item 1: 0 units = 0\n   - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 67 = 201\n   - Item 3: 0 units = 0\n   - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n   - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n   - Total value = 0 + 201 + 0 + 18 + 96 = 315\n\nSince the value of 315 is greater than my outside offer (239), I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 3, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 89. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To evaluate the current situation and decide on the best action, let's break down the problems step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 89.\n- **Values of the Items for Me**:\n  - Item 1: 60\n  - Item 2: 80\n  - Item 3: 11\n  - Item 4: 50\n  - Item 5: 100\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 7 units\n  - Item 4: 4 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is 0.9, which implies a slight reduction in value if negotiations go into further rounds. However, decisions should ideally maximize the total value immediately where possible.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer from Player 1**: [0, 1, 3, 1, 1].\n  - Value Calculation for Current Offer:\n    - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 60 = 0\n    - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 80 = 80\n    - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 11 = 33\n    - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 50 = 50\n    - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 100 = 100\n    - Total Value = 0 + 80 + 33 + 50 + 100 = 263\n\nThis offer gives me a total value of 263, which is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 89.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**  \n  Yes, accepting the current offer gives me a total value of 263, compared to the outside offer value of 89, which is much lower.\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?**  \n  No, because accepting the current offer provides more value than walking away with only 89.\n\n- **Should I Propose a Counteroffer?**  \n  There might be potential to negotiate for an even better deal, but the current offer already provides substantial value. Given the risk of Player 1 not agreeing to a counteroffer and the possibility of ending without a deal or a lesser future offer, accepting seems prudent.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most sensible action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine my next action, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 672.\n   - The values of the items involved to me are:\n     - Item 1: 6 per unit\n     - Item 2: 87 per unit\n     - Item 3: 88 per unit (Note: Not relevant here since all units are offered to me)\n     - Item 4: 88 per unit (Note: Not relevant here since there are 0 units)\n     - Item 5: 61 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor in round 1 is not applicable since this is the initial offer. We calculate the value directly.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [0, 5, 1, 0, 0]\n       - Value to me:\n         - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n         - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 87 = 435\n         - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 88 = 88\n         - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 88 = 0\n         - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 61 = 0\n       - Total value = 523\n   - Compare this total (523) with my outside offer value (672). The current offer value is less than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since the value of my current offer (523) is below my outside offer value (672), I should consider making a counteroffer that could potentially result in a value higher than 672, or walk away.\n   - Let's counteroffer a division where I aim to exceed my outside value by focusing on item 1, 4, and 5, given their relatively lower total availability and high value of item 2, which is almost entirely offered to me.\n   - A better counter-offer might be: [0, 3, 2, 0, 0]. I keep more of item 5 for myself since it has a higher value to me.\n\nNow, let's calculate my value if I propose the counteroffer [0, 3, 2, 0, 2] (i.e., giving 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 2 of item 5 to the other player):\n- Remaining for me:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 88 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 61 = 0\n- Total value = 362\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer. I aim to adjust the counteroffer to potentially receive a higher value.\n\nWith these considerations, I will make a revised counteroffer to ensure I maximize my benefit:\n\n- Counteroffer: [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]\n  - Value calculation if accepted:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 12\n    - 4 units of item 2 = 348\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 88\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 61\n  - Total value = 509\n\nWith this counteroffer, I am trying to create a negotiation space. However, given my valuation for the items I still need to strategically hold to emphasize item 2 and get some more negotiation scope, I should adjust it for my overall strategy:\n\nI will propose:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 2]}",

In the first round (r = 1), the discount doesn't affect the current offer, but it would affect future rounds (r > 1).\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer (offered to me: [2, 2, 1, 0, 2]):\n   - Value for 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n   - Value for 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n   - Value for 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n   - Value for 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 93 = 0\n   - Value for 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n   - Total value = 336\n\n   The value of the current offer is 336, which is lower than my outside offer value of 378.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Should I accept the current offer?

Here's one potential proposal:\n  - Let Player 1 have: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0] (I keep more valuable items)\n  \n  - My valuation if I receive [3, 4, 2, 5, 0]:\n    - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222\n    - 4 units of Item 2 = 4 \u00d7 34 = 136 \n    - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n    - 5 units of Item 4 = 5 \u00d7 32 = 160 \n    - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n  - Total Value = 674\n\n- **Conclusion:**\n  The current offer is less valuable to me than my outside option, so I should propose a counteroffer that provides me a better value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If we go to another round, the value I receive would be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer (to me: [2, 0, 3, 0, 1]): \n     - Items I receive based on the current offer:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 33 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 37 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n     - Total value = 158 + 2 = 160\n   \n   - Value if I accept the current offer is far less than my outside offer value of 432.\n   - Potential counteroffers:\n     - It's important to make a counteroffer that gives me more than 432 in value. One potential division where I might achieve this could involve ensuring I receive more high-value items (like item 1 and item 4) that maximize my total value.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer of 160 undercuts my outside offer value significantly.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a minimum value closer to or exceeding 432.\n\nNow let's construct a logical counteroffer:\n- Here's an example counteroffer: [0, 2, 0, 0, 1]. This gives Player 1 zero units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, zero units of items 3 and 4, and 1 unit of item 5.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since this is round 3, the value of an accepted deal is multiplied by 0.9\u00b2 = 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer [2, 1, 2, 3, 0]:** This means I receive:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 (3 - 2 = 1 unit to me) = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n     - 1 unit of item 2 (2 - 1 = 1 unit to me) = 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n     - 2 units of item 3 (4 - 2 = 2 units to me) = 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n     - 2 units of item 4 (5 - 3 = 2 units to me) = 2 \u00d7 40 = 80\n     - 1 unit of item 5 (1 - 0 = 1 unit to me) = 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n     - Total raw value = 10 + 26 + 192 + 80 + 52 = 360\n     - Discounted value = 360 \u00d7 0.81 = 291.6\n\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 212. The discounted value of the current offer exceeds my outside offer value.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - **Should I Accept?** The current offer has a value of 291.6 (discounted), which is more than my outside offer of 212. Therefore, accepting the offer is beneficial.\n   \n   - **Should I Walk Away?** Walking away is not favorable, as the current offer exceeds the outside offer.\n\n   - **Counteroffer Possibility:** Since this is the final round, proposing a counteroffer effectively means walking away, which is less favorable than accepting the current offer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Thus, accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\n  - Walking away guarantees me a value of 109.\n\n- **Consider Counteroffers:**\n  - I should propose a counteroffer where I receive more valuable items to maximize my value above 109.\n\nLet's explore a potential counteroffer. I need to ensure my total value is greater than 109 after discount:\n\n- **Propose Counteroffer of [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]:**\n  - I will receive:\n    - Item 1: 2 units => 2 * 81 = 162\n    - Item 2: 4 units => 4 * 11 = 44\n    - Item 3: 1 unit => 1 * 38 = 38\n    - Item 4: 2 units => 2 * 12 = 24\n    - Item 5: 5 units => 5 * 22 = 110\n  - Total Value = 162 + 44 + 38 + 24 + 110 = 378\n  - Discounted Value = 378 * 0.9 = 340.2\n\nThis counteroffer provides a far superior value, even after discount, compared to my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 801. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1095.\n   - My values per unit for the items are: item 1 = 9, item 2 = 97, item 3 = 72, item 4 = 85, item 5 = 32.\n   - The total pool of items is: 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor influences the value by reducing it in future rounds, but currently, we are in round 1, so it's less relevant at the moment.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [3, 2, 2, 2, 3]\n     - Value if accepted:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96\n     - Total value = 27 + 194 + 144 + 170 + 96 = 631\n\n   - Compare this value to my outside offer value of 1095.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the offer gives me a value of 631, which is much lower than my outside offer value of 1095.\n   - Walking away would guarantee me the outside offer value of 1095.\n   - I should consider a counteroffer that maximizes my value while considering the constraint of Player 1's acceptance.\n\nGiven the current offer's value is significantly less than my outside offer, I should consider making a counteroffer that brings my total closer to or above 1095. For example, offering Player 1 less of the high-value items for me, such as item 2 and item 4, could improve my value.\n\nPropose counteroffer: Offer Player 1 a distribution like [5, 1, 2, 1, 3] (meaning I keep [2, 4, 2, 4, 3]):\n\n- My value if this counteroffer is accepted:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 97 = 388\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 85 = 340\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96\n- Total value = 18 + 388 + 144 + 340 + 96 = 986\n\nAlthough still less than 1095, this is better than the current offer. However, since it is the first round, I might be able to improve further. \n\nTherefore, I will attempt this adjustment as a counteroffer to see if a better value deal can be negotiated.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 1, 2, 1, 3]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 212. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 4, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 88. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I will propose a division that favors keeping the high-value items with me. Here's one option:\n     - Keep 1 unit of item 2 (most valuable)\n     - Offer Player 1 fewer units of less valuable items.\n\n   - Proposal for counteroffer:\n     - Offer [3, 1, 3, 1, 1] \n     - My share: [1, 4, 0, 0, 2]\n     - Calculate my value:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n       - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 37 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 52 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n     - Total value = 377\n\n   Given the calculations, a counteroffer where I keep 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 has a high value for me.\n\nThus, my action is to propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

To assess my total value:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 20 = 60\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 * 79 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 24 = 72\n     - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 72 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 66 = 132\n     - Total value if I accept this offer: 60 + 0 + 72 + 0 + 132 = 264\n\n   - This value (264) is far below my outside offer of 1291. Therefore, accepting this current offer is not favorable.\n\n3) Considering potential counteroffers:\n   - I need to structure a counteroffer that maximizes my value, ideally above my outside offer.\n   - Let's consider an offer where Player 1 receives [3, 0, 2, 0, 3] units:\n     - I would get: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n     - My total value: \n       - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 20 = 60\n       - 4 units of item 2: 4 * 79 = 316\n       - 3 units of item 3: 3 * 24 = 72\n       - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 72 = 288\n       - 6 units of item 5: 6 * 66 = 396\n       - Total value: 60 + 316 + 72 + 288 + 396 = 1132\n\n   - This counteroffer still doesn't meet my outside offer (1291). However, there is potential if revised slightly for a better value. More adjustments could progressively increase my potential share.\n\nGiven this analysis, I should make a reasonable counteroffer closer to my outside offer, balanced by the discount factor's impact. \n\nTherefore, I will propose the counteroffer:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 0, 3]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Even considering the discount factor in future rounds, this offer is not worth accepting.\n   \n3) **Decision based on analysis**:\n   - Given that the current offer (150) is far less than my outside offer (656), I should either propose a counteroffer or walk away.\n   \nLet's consider a counteroffer where I retain more items that are valuable to me:\n\n- I highly value Item 3 and Item 4, followed by Item 1, with low value on Items 2 and 5.\n- I want to retain as many of Item 3 (value 61) and Item 4 (value 82) as possible.\n\n**Counteroffer calculation**:\nIf I offer Player 1 most of the less valuable items while maximizing my value with Items 3 and 4, let's consider this offer:\n\n- Offer: [0, 7, 4, 0, 2]\n- Keeping: [2, 1, 4, 2, 0]\n\nCalculate my total value:\n- 2 units of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n- 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n- 4 units of Item 3: 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n- 2 units of Item 4: 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n- 0 unit of Item 5: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n- Total value = 56 + 10 + 244 + 164 + 0 = 474\n\nThis counteroffer yields a value of 474. It's still below my outside offer of 656, but substantially more than the current offer. However, it is important to make a strategic decision to ensure the offer aligns closer to my outside offer while taking negotiation dynamics into account. This offer gives me a strong position on item allocation.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer to maximize my potential gain:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 7, 4, 0, 2]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 4, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 4, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't apply until future rounds, so the full value of 675 is considered.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   Since the current offer value (675) is greater than your outside offer (424), accepting the offer maximizes your outcome compared to walking away. \n\nThus, the most logical course of action is to accept the current offer. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 388. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 195.\n   - My values per unit of each item are:\n     - Item 1: 2\n     - Item 2: 21\n     - Item 3: 4\n     - Item 4: 37\n     - Item 5: 23\n   - The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. As this is round 2, any future values would be less compared to accepting it now due to the discount rate.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer ([0, 6, 0, 0, 0]):**\n     - Item 1: 0 units, value = 0\n     - Item 2: 6 units, value = 6 \u00d7 21 = 126\n     - Item 3: 0 units, value = 0\n     - Item 4: 0 units, value = 0\n     - Item 5: 0 units, value = 0\n     - Total value of the current offer = 126\n   - This value (126) is lower than my outside offer of 195.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n     - I should aim for a total value greater than 195 given the third round discount factor of \\(0.9^1 = 0.9\\), which means I will need a value greater than \\(195/0.9 = 216.67\\) in round 3 to exceed my outside offer value.\n     - To reach this value, I need to maximize high-value items like item 4 and 5.\n     - Let's compute for keeping:\n       - 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n   \n\n     \\[\n     0 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 21 + 0 \\times 4 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     Total = 0 + 3 \\times 37 + 2 \\times 23 = 147\n     \\]\n   - The total value is significantly less than required so we need to make the offer better. I'll lower the demands on item 3.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - I cannot accept the current offer as 126 is less than my outside offer of 195.\n   - I should not walk away yet, as I might propose a counteroffer which could potentially yield a value greater than 195.\n   - Formulating a counteroffer:\n     - I propose to give Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n     - Retaining for myself: 6 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 \n    \nCalculating my new value: \n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 2 = 12\n- 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 21 = 126\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 23 = 0\n- Total = 12 + 126 + 0 + 74 + 0 = 212\n\nThis total is higher than my outside offer when accounting for the future discount, where I need >= 216.67 value.\n\nHence, my decision is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "To make a decision, I'll follow the step-by-step approach:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 404\n   - My values per unit for each item type:\n     - Item 1: 47\n     - Item 2: 37\n     - Item 3: 14\n     - Item 4: 5\n     - Item 5: 69\n   - Total pool of items: 6 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 11 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. For round 1, the multiplier is \\(0.9^{0} = 1\\), so it has no immediate effect now, but will impact future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer to me: [3, 0, 1, 6, 1]\n     - Value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 47 = 141\n       - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 37 = 0\n       - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 14 = 14\n       - Item 4: 6 units \u00d7 5 = 30\n       - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 69 = 69\n     - Total value = 141 + 0 + 14 + 30 + 69 = 254\n\n   - The total value of the current offer (254) is much less than my outside offer (404), so accepting is not beneficial at this stage.\n   - I would want to propose a potential counteroffer that gives me a value higher than 404 after considering future rounds.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Given the current offer's value (254) compared to my outside offer (404), I will propose a counteroffer. The goal is to ensure I receive a value greater than 404.\n\n   Evaluating a counteroffer where I keep 4 units of item 1 and 2 units of item 3, and offer the rest:\n   - My units:\n     - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 47 = 94\n     - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 37 = 0\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 14 = 28\n     - Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 5 = 25\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 69 = 69\n   - Total new counteroffer value for me = 94 + 0 + 28 + 25 + 69 = 216\n   - Still not optimal, I need to explore more beneficial divisions perhaps focusing on getting higher units of higher-valued item 1 or item 5.\n\nEvaluating a counteroffer where I keep 4 units of item 1 and 2 units of item 5, and offer the rest:\n   - My units:\n     - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 47 = 188\n     - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 37 = 0\n     - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 14 = 0\n     - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 5 = 20\n     - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 69 = 0\n   - Total new counteroffer value for me = 188 + 0 + 0 + 20 + 0 = 208\n   - Need to adjust to meet or surpass my outside offer value of 404 if possible. Let's try balancing more towards item 5 and item 1:\n\nEvaluating a counteroffer where I keep 5 units of item 1 and 2 units of item 5, and offer the rest:\n   - My units:\n     - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 47 = 235\n     - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 37 = 0\n     - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 14 = 0\n     - Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 5 = 25\n     - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 69 = 0\n   - Total value = 235 + 0 + 0 + 25 + 0 = 260, not satisfactory either.\n\nAfter more consideration with varied item configurations and respects other player potential values, I will still end up lower than my outside offer in possible unit distributions respecting items count constrains, indicating I should look to retain maximizing item valuations differences directionally. \n\nI will propose:\n   \nEvaluating offering Player 1: 1 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 1 of item 5:\n- Counteroffer: \n  I Keep:\n  - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 47 = 235\n  - Item 2: 0\n  - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 14 = 42\n  - Item 4: 6 units \u00d7 5 = 30\n  - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 69 = 69\n  Total value: 376\n\nThis isn't optimal, stress testing achieving bounds. Prioritize testing higher proportions of max valuation units for counter balancing consideration.\n\nUltimately, matching near or achieving above outside offer value without agreement comprehension here lean strategically towards decide immediately between exploring favourable counteroffer patterns upon own valuations into next stages. Thus I will propose a counteroffer:\n\n- {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 5, 1]}",

For round 2, the value of accepting an offer is multiplied by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9. This means the current value is 90% of its nominal value because it's round 2.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current offer [6, 0, 0, 8, 0]:** \n     - Value = (6 \u00d7 47) + (0 \u00d7 37) + (0 \u00d7 14) + (8 \u00d7 5) + (0 \u00d7 69)\n     - Value = 282 + 0 + 0 + 40 + 0 = 322\n     - Discounted value in round 2 = 322 \u00d7 0.9 = 289.8\n   \n   - **Comparison with outside offer:**\n     - The discounted value of the current offer (289.8) is less than my outside offer value (404). Therefore, accepting the current offer is not beneficial compared to my outside offer.\n     \n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is less valuable than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away ensures a value of 404, which is higher than the discounted value of the current offer.\n   - I should attempt a counteroffer to improve the terms in my favor.\n\n4) **Counteroffer Assessment:**\n   - I will attempt to maximize the value I can get from items while still leaving Player 1 with a reasonable offer. I need to make sure my calculated value (after discount) is above my outside offer.\n\n   - Let's make a counteroffer such as [4, 0, 0, 7, 1] for Player 1:\n     - My units: [2, 0, 3, 4, 1]\n     - My value: (2 \u00d7 47) + (0 \u00d7 37) + (3 \u00d7 14) + (4 \u00d7 5) + (1 \u00d7 69) = 364\n     - Discounted value in round 2 = 364 \u00d7 0.9 = 327.6\n\nIn this scenario, since my primary objective is to surpass my outside offer, this is still not enough. Therefore, my optimal action would be to walk away because I cannot reach a deal that gives me greater value than my guaranteed 404 after discounting.\n\nThus, my decision is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Waiting or protracting yields a discount (gamma = 0.9 per extra round).  \n\nStep 2: Assessing offers  \n\u2022 Any deal I pursue must give me at least more than 267 in value when valued at my private numbers.  \n\u2022 For any counteroffer, my value is the sum of (remaining units for me \u00d7 my per-unit value for each item).  \n\u2022 One common tactic is to give the counterpart items that are relatively less valuable to me while keeping for myself most of the high\u2010value ones.  \n\u2022 A balanced and likely acceptable division from my perspective is to \u201csplit\u201d the items roughly in a 60\u201340 fashion (in my valuation). Given my values, keeping about 60% of total value ensures a large gain for me while leaving the other side with enough to potentially be better than their unknown outside offer.  \n\u2022 Translating that idea into actual item counts:  \n\u2003\u2013 For item 1 (4 units), roughly 40% is 1.6 units \u2192 rounding to 2 units for Player 2.  \n\u2003\u2013 For item 2 (4 units), roughly 40% is 1.6 units \u2192 2 units for Player 2.  \n\u2003\u2013 For item 3 (3 units), 40% is about 1.2 \u2192 1 unit for Player 2.  \n\u2003\u2013 For item 4 (6 units), 40% is about 2.4 \u2192 2 units for Player 2.  \n\u2003\u2013 For item 5 (6 units), similarly about 2 units for Player 2.  \n\u2022 Under this offer, my allocation would be:  \n\u2003item 1: 2 (I get 2\u00d713 = 26),  \n\u2003item 2: 2 (2\u00d796 = 192),  \n\u2003item 3: 2 (2\u00d771 = 142),  \n\u2003item 4: 4 (4\u00d717 = 68),  \n\u2003item 5: 4 (4\u00d763 = 252).  \n\u2022 My total value would then be 26 + 192 + 142 + 68 + 252 = 680, well above my outside offer of 267.  \n\u2022 This split should be a reasonable starting point since it leaves Player 2 with: [2, 2, 1, 2, 2] units which might be acceptable given their uncertainty about their own values and outside option.  \n\nStep 3: Decision  \nSince there isn\u2019t an existing offer on the table and it is round 1, I will initiate with a counteroffer that gives Player 2 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This offer guarantees me 680 in my own valuation and leaves Player 2 a nonzero bundle to evaluate against their outside offer.  \n\nFinal action:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]}",

The current offer's adjusted value (245.7) is far below my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The current offer's value adjusted for the discount factor is significantly lower than my outside offer, making it unattractive to accept.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while considering Player 1's likely preferences. I aim to keep enough of high-value items for myself so the counteroffer provides me with a value close to or exceeding my outside offer when adjusted by the discount factor. Suppose I propose a counteroffer: [1, 1, 0, 3, 3]. Let's calculate the total value again:\n\n     - For me (i.e., items retained after offering):\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n     - Total value = 72 + 135 + 30 + 183 + 216 = 636\n     - Adjusting for the discount factor (0.9), the effective value is 636 * 0.9 = 572.4\n\n   - This counteroffer is also still lower than my outside offer value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 266. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Although this factor influences the value of future rounds, in this scenario, it only affects the final decision outcome based on which round ends. Currently, the present round value applies.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 1: [2, 2, 3, 5, 2] (items offered to me)\n     - My value for accepting this offer:\n       - Item 1: 2 x 14 = 28\n       - Item 2: 2 x 40 = 80\n       - Item 3: 3 x 29 = 87\n       - Item 4: 5 x 32 = 160\n       - Item 5: 2 x 40 = 80\n       - Total value = 28 + 80 + 87 + 160 + 80 = 435\n\n   - Compare with my outside offer value of 1, which is drastically lower than 435.\n\n   - Considering a counteroffer:\n     - A counteroffer would need to provide me with a value greater than 435 after considering negotiations and possible acceptance by Player 1. Given the current offer, any further negotiation from my side might risk losing my current value.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Should I accept? The value of 435 is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n   - Should I walk away? My outside offer value is only 1, which is much less attractive than the current offer value of 435.\n   - Should I propose a specific counteroffer? Given my analysis, the current offer is highly beneficial.\n\nTherefore, the best decision in this case is to accept the current offer from Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 742. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 699 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To decide on my action, I need to evaluate the current offer against my outside offer and potential counteroffers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 742.\n- **Values of the items involved:**\n  - Item 1: 49 per unit\n  - Item 2: 94 per unit\n  - Item 3: 25 per unit\n  - Item 4: 45 per unit\n  - Item 5: 20 per unit\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - 7 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n- **Discount factor:** The discount rate is gamma = 0.9, reducing the value of deals in later rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** [2, 0, 3, 0, 1] (This is what I receive)\n  - Value to me:\n    - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n    - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 94 = 0\n    - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n    - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n  - Total value = 98 + 0 + 75 + 0 + 20 = 193\n  - Discounted value in round 1 = 193 * (0.9)^0 = 193\n  \n- **Evaluation:** The current offer's value to me (193) is much lower than my outside offer (742). \n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on the analysis\n\nGiven the significant discrepancy between the current offer's value (193) and my outside offer value (742), and considering that even with discounting the outside offer is more valuable:\n\n- **Accept the current offer?** No, because 193 is far less than 742.\n- **Walk away?** Potentially viable if no better counteroffer can be reached.\n- **Consider counteroffer:** A counteroffer that maximizes my total value while still offering Player 1 something from the total pool. I'll aim to at least reach a value close to 742.\n\n**Potential Counteroffer Example:**\n- I keep most units with higher value for me. Offer Player 1 fewer units of low-value items for me.\n\nProposed offer to Player 1: [5, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n- Remaining for me: [2, 2, 3, 0, 3]\n- Total value to me if accepted:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n  - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n  - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n  - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n- Total value = 98 + 188 + 75 + 60 = 421\n- Discounted value in round 2 = 421 * (0.9)^1 = 378.9\n\nThis value is still less than my outside offer, but let's ensure Player 1 has some space since I understand my outside offer is substantially beneficial.\n\n**Action:**\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Ensuring negotiation intensity across 2 rounds is strategic, before a favorable valuation diminishes with gamma effects. A different configuration holding higher valuation wouldn't rationally provide adequate appeal to opponent variables. Thus, assurance of a comparable loss of opportunities is enforceable through increased round allocations, but inherently stunted due to premature onset.\n\nUltimately, my outside offer remains superior to the accepted prospect despite interim allocations, while proposing marked integer provisions uplift with familiarities across contextual propositions over competitive favor during successive cycles of prospective settlements.\n\nChoosing the foothold logically succumbs to withdrawal over alternating counter with tactical withholds.\n   \n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If Player 1 doesn't accept a better offer than what they currently proposed, the benefits are substantial enough to accept compared to my outside offer.\n   - Given there's room to explore better division potentially more in my favor in upcoming rounds due to my high value on item 4, a COUNTER may be feasible as long as it might justify in terms of motivating negotiation.\n    \nHere, I'll make a strategic COUNTEROFFER keeping most of the high-value items with me, testing if Player 1 might agree; I'll propose them a balanced distribution that reduces what they took and expands to some of mine:\n\nCounter Offer: [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]\n- For Player 1:\n  - 1 unit of Item 1 (12 for me)\n  - 2 units of Item 2 (24 for me)\n  - 2 units of Item 3 (22 for me)\n  - 0 unit of Item 4 (0 for me)\n  - 2 units of Item 5 (58 for me)\n- Total value for what I propose to them = 12 + 24 + 22 + 0 + 58 = 116 kept, 269 for me.\n- My value from offer become: (18 + 12 + 11 + 188 + 29) = 258\n- Should distinctly project value intent for what I miss from giving.\n\nTherefore, my decision, factoring current benefits and discoverable, more rightful value I've kept in high-regarded items, my counteroffer reads as below:\n  \n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

However, since the current offer already yields a very high value compared to my outside offer, making a counteroffer might not be necessary unless I can significantly improve my value without risking the discount factor undermining the deal.\n\n### 3) Decision:\n\n- **Comparison**: The current offer provides a value of 262, which is significantly above my outside offer (68). The discount factor for future rounds could reduce any potential value gains from counteroffering.\n\n- **Decision**: Given that the received value from the current offer is substantial compared to my outside offer, and to avoid the risk of a lesser final value due to negotiating into further rounds with the discount factor applied, **accepting the current offer is optimal**.\n\nTherefore, my decision is: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 254. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 106. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 525 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

The best step here is to propose a counteroffer aiming to increase the value above 781 if the negotiation continues in future rounds.\n\nTo make a reasonable counteroffer:\n\n- I should aim to increase my share of high-value items (item 1 and item 3).\n- Aiming for an overall division that provides a total value well over 781 while ideally being acceptable to Player 1.\n\nA potential counteroffer:\n- Keep at least 3 units of item 1 and both units of item 3, as they are high value to me.\n- Possible counteroffer: [1, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\nLet's calculate my value if this counteroffer is accepted:\n- I keep: [3, 3, 2, 1, 4]\n  - Value: \n    - \\( 3 \\times 100 = 300 \\) for item 1\n    - \\( 3 \\times 28 = 84 \\) for item 2\n    - \\( 2 \\times 87 = 174 \\) for item 3\n    - \\( 1 \\times 62 = 62 \\) for item 4\n    - \\( 4 \\times 38 = 152 \\) for item 5\n  - Total value: \\( 300 + 84 + 174 + 62 + 152 = 772 \\)\n\nBecause 772 is still under the outside offer of 781 and our aim should exceed the outside offer, given that it might not meet the requirements, I might need to increase my share of a high-value item further.\n\nHence, a safer counteroffer that surely exceeds 781 in its first value might be needed but requires understanding of Player 1's threshold. However, given rules and validity checks, the above balance seems logical for a potential acceptance. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 4]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 584. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 690 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 5]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 5, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 584.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 16\n     - Item 2: 81\n     - Item 3: 31\n     - Item 4: 63\n     - Item 5: 39\n   - The total pool of items is 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 11 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9, which means the value of the negotiation outcome is reduced by 10% per round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer (from Player 1): [0, 5, 0, 0, 1]\n     - If I accept, I get:\n       - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 81 = 405\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n     - Total value of accepting current offer = 405 + 39 = 444\n     - Adjusted for current round with discount: 444 * 0.9 = 399.6\n   - Compare 399.6 (value of accepting offer) to my outside offer value of 584.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me significantly less value than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away will guarantee me a value of 584.\n   - I will evaluate a counteroffer that potentially maximizes my value over 584 after accounting for discount.\n\nGiven this, accepting the current offer is not beneficial. Since the current offer does not meet or exceed the outside offer, and because a counteroffer cannot be modified in the last round (making it infeasible to negotiate further), walking away is the most reasonable decision to avoid an unfavorable deal.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This influences the present value of future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer from Player 1:** [0, 1, 0, 8, 0]\n     - Value to me if I accept:\n       - 0 units of Item 1: 0 \u00d7 24 = 0\n       - 1 units of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n       - 0 units of Item 3: 0 \u00d7 92 = 0\n       - 8 units of Item 4: 8 \u00d7 11 = 88\n       - 0 units of Item 5: 0 \u00d7 90 = 0\n       - Total value = 0 + 8 + 0 + 88 + 0 = 96\n     - This is my total value in Round 2 before discount, and with the discount factor applied, it remains 96.\n\n   - **My outside offer:** 410\n\n   - Potential counteroffers need to yield more value than my outside offer of 410 to be worth considering. \n\n   - Comparing 96 (value from current offer) with 410, it's clear that the current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   Since the current offer provides only 96 in value which is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 410, it's not beneficial for me to accept it. I should consider making a counteroffer that maximizes the value I can receive. Since we need to consider the upcoming round is round 3, I can propose a counteroffer that maximizes my return before I'd choose to walk.\n\n   **Proposing a Counteroffer:**\n   Aiming to keep enough value for myself, I will propose that Player 1 receives: \n   - 3 units of Item 1\n   - 2 units of Item 2\n   - 0 units of Item 3\n   - 5 units of Item 4\n   - 0 units of Item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n   - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n   - 5 units of Item 2 = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n   - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 92 = 184\n   - 3 units of Item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n   - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n\nTotal value = 72 + 40 + 184 + 33 + 180 = 509\n\nThe value in this counteroffer is significantly greater than my outside offer.\n\nSo my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 5, 0]}\n```",

But if we enter round 2, the value of any outcome will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - **Current Offer:** [0, 4, 1, 0, 0] \n     - My value from this offer would be:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 89 = 0\n       - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 56 = 224\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n       - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n     - Total value from current offer = 224 + 10 = 234\n\n   - Comparing 234 to my outside offer of 458, the current offer is substantially lower.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since the current offer's value (234) is much lower than my outside offer (458), I should not accept it.\n   - Walking away would secure me 458, which is better than accepting the current offer.\n   - Let's consider a reasonable counteroffer to maximize my value and see if it improves the situation. If I retain more of the higher-value items (e.g., item 1 and item 2), my total value might exceed my outside offer.\n\n   For a counteroffer, I propose to take:\n   - 2 units of item 1 (entirely mine)\n   - 0 units of item 2 (give to Player 1 for incentives)\n   - 0 units of item 3 (give to Player 1 as it is not high value for me)\n   - 1 unit of item 4 (possible sharing this beneficial item)\n   - 0 units of item 5 (low value shared with Player 1)\n\n   This counteroffer is [0, 4, 2, 2, 5], thus I propose: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] to Player 1.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that any future offer will have its value discounted by 0.9 per round delay.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer on the table: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n     - Value to me if accepted:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n       - 0 unit of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 81 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n     - Total value = 93 + 48 + 29 + 0 + 19 = 189\n\n   - The current offer value (189) is significantly less than my outside offer value (306).\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The current offer is significantly less valuable than my outside offer value.\n   - A counteroffer should provide more than or equal to 306 for me to consider it. I can consider keeping:\n     - Most units of item 1, 2, or 4 as these have higher values per my private valuation.\n   - I need to ensure my proposed allocation yields more than 306.\n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer where I get a high value by retaining more valuable items:\n\n   - Possible counteroffer: \n     - Offer most of item 5 and item 3 to Player 1, and retain most of item 1 and item 4 for a higher total value.\n     - Counteroffer: [0, 0, 2, 0, 4]\n\n   - Calculate the value for me:\n     - 5 units of item 1 (I keep) = 5 \u00d7 93 = 465\n     - 4 units of item 2 (I keep) = 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n     - 1 unit of item 3 (I keep) = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n     - 2 units of item 4 (I keep) = 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n     - 2 unit of item 5 (I keep) = 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n     - Total value = 465 + 192 + 29 + 162 + 38 = 886\n\nThe counteroffer I can make gives more value to me which is well over my outside offer and ensures that I'm maximizing value beyond the outside offer.

Since it is now round 2, any value I calculate for outcomes is realized at a factor of \\( \\gamma^{(2-1)} = 0.9 \\).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer by Player 1 is [0, 0, 3, 0, 0], which means I receive all 3 units of item 3. Calculating my total value:\n     \\[\n     Value = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n     \\]\n     Adjusting for the discount factor (0.9):\n     \\[\n     Total\\ Value = 48 \\times 0.9 = 43.2\n     \\]\n   - This value is significantly lower than my outside offer of 318.\n\n   Let's consider potential counteroffers that could exceed my outside offer when adjusted for the discount factor:\n   - If I choose to keep all the items minus 1 unit of each item, I would consider offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] again, which means I keep:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - Calculating my total value:\n     \\[\n     Value = (3 \\times 42) + (3 \\times 56) + (2 \\times 16) + (3 \\times 82) + (4 \\times 11) \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     Value = 126 + 168 + 32 + 246 + 44 = 616\n     \\]\n     Adjusting for the discount factor:\n     \\[\n     Total\\ Value = 616 \\times 0.9 = 554.4\n     \\]\n   - 554.4 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 318.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer from Player 1 (43.2) is much lower than my outside offer (318).\n   - My proposed counteroffer ([1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) gives a higher adjusted value (554.4) compared to the outside offer (318).\n\nGiven these calculations, making a counteroffer is beneficial, as it provides considerable value over walking away with the outside offer and much more than accepting the current offer.\n\nMy action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's work through the steps:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 202.\n   - My item values are:\n     - Item 1: 17\n     - Item 2: 30\n     - Item 3: 1\n     - Item 4: 13\n     - Item 5: 3\n   - The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor influences the decision as accepting a deal in the first round is more valuable than in subsequent rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me [5, 0, 0, 3, 0] means I get:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n   - Total value to me if I accept = 17 + 0 + 2 + 13 + 6 = 38\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The value of accepting the current offer (38) is far lower than my outside offer value (202). Therefore, accepting the current offer is not a good option.\n   - Walking away means I guarantee myself the outside offer of 202, which is currently the benchmark to beat.\n   - To make a counteroffer, I need to ensure I receive at least 202 in value. \n\nLet's create a counteroffer:\n- If I keep all items, the value to me is 252.\n- My goal is to propose a division where I receive at least 202 in value.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer such that I keep a significant portion of the higher-valued items for my valuation.\n\nPotential counteroffer calculation:\n- I want at least 202, which means I can give up items worth 50 to me.\n- Let's consider the following allocation to Player 1 as a counteroffer: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nMy calculation based on counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]:\n- I keep 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 17 = 85\n- I keep 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n- I keep 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- I keep 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n- I keep 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- Total value to me if accepted = 85 + 60 + 2 + 39 + 3 = 189\n\nThe total value to me is 189, which is below my outside offer. I need to propose a tighter allocation to allow me to reach the goal above 202, knowing the initial suggestion was not enough, I will make slight adjustments to improve it.\n\nLet's propose an alternative counteroffer: [2, 2, 1, 2, 2], and let's calculate:\n\n- I keep 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 17 = 68\n- I keep 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n- I keep 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- I keep 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n- I keep 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- Total value to me if accepted = 68 + 30 + 1 + 26 + 0 = 125\n\nIt appears the strategy was aggressive for what is due. By recalibrating and still aiming to edge the value to cross over the threshold, let's propose: [3, 2, 1, 3, 1] and reevaluate:\n\n- I keep 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n- I keep 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n- I keep 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- I keep 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n- I keep 1 units of item 5: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- Total value to me if accepted = 51 + 30 + 1 + 13 + 3 = 98\n\nIt seems I failed to find a way to propose greater than my outside. Instead, provide a more optimized one; [2, 3, 2, 3, 2]\n\n- I keep 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 17 = 68\n- I keep 3 unit of item 2: 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n- I keep 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- I keep 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n- I keep 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- Total value to me if accepted = 68 + 90 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 158\n\nUltimately, my action is not producing favorable condition to overpass my outside offer, demonstrating a more simple offer and attempt to be more favorable in the division to bring the next assessments:\n\nHere is more valid counteroffer for a new attempt: \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 1, 1, 3, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 528. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 510 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

When comparing offers, we compare their direct value against my outside offer adjusted for delay.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Value of accepting the current offer [0, 4, 0, 0, 3]:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 75 = 0\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 43 = 172\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 25 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n     - Total value = 172 + 75 = 247\n\n   - My outside offer is 528, which is much greater than 247, thus accepting this offer is not favorable.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Should I accept the current offer? No, because 247 < 528.\n   - Should I walk away and take my outside offer? Not necessarily yet.

Therefore, accepting this offer is not preferable.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Since the current offer (value = 187) is less than my outside offer (value = 339), I should not accept the current offer.\n   - I could propose a counteroffer that maximizes my item values while keeping more valuable items for myself.\n   \n   Considering the high value of item 5 (78) and item 4 (72), I'll aim to maximize the retention of these items, and also retain more of item 1 over item 2 and 3, as it has a higher value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 184. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 402 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I know their values are random and uncertain, so I\u2019ll suggest keeping some:\n   - Reduce my values closer to being amenable, like keeping 3 items 5 and 3 items 3, for instance.\n\n   Adjusting offer flow ([2, 2, 1, 1, 3] already):\n   - Test: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1] (keep 5, 5, 4, 1, 5).\n   - But walk is strategic if failed, propose:\n   - Considering: Keeping more items and introducing their minimal utilization by them.\n\n   **Decision:**\n   ```json\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 1, 1, 3]}\n   ```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1170. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1050 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
