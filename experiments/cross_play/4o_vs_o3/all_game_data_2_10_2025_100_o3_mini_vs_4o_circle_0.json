Comparing this with the offer value:\n   - Current offer provides 326 value, much lower than the outside offer of 558.\n\n3. **Consider Counteroffer:**\n\n   Since it's round 1 and the discount rate is 0.9, it might be beneficial to make a counteroffer that benefits more than the current offer without going lower than the outside offer. To entice Player 1, it is realistic to shift their offer a bit to see their reaction. I aim for a higher allocation of items valuably higher than currently offered:\n\n   Proposed adjustment of offer to Player 1:\n   - Item 1: Offer 2 (leave 1 for me instead of 2)\n   - Item 2: Offer 1 (as previous, matching)\n   - Item 3: Offer 0 (as previous, matching)\n   - Item 4: Offer 2 (I offer 2, keep 4 instead of 3)\n   - Item 5: Offer 1 (matching)\n\n   My proposed counteroffer [2, 1, 0, 2, 1] gives me:\n   - Item 1: 1 unit = 9\n   - Item 2: 1 unit = 47\n   - Item 3: 1 unit = 68\n   - Item 4: 4 units = 308\n   - Item 5: 1 unit = 39\n\n   Total value if this counteroffer is accepted = 9 + 47 + 68 + 308 + 39 = 471\n\n   The counteroffer results in a higher value for me than the current offer, yet it remains below the outside offer (558).\n\n4. **Decision:** Make a counteroffer. The potential value gain from negotiating further exceeds accepting the current offer.

My highest\u2010value items for me are item 1 (value 94 each) and item 3 (value 56 each), so I want to keep them.\n2. I know my overall value if I take all item1 and item3 is high (5\u00d794 + 4\u00d756 = 694). I also want to keep as many lower\u2010value items as possible since my values on items 2 (35), 4 (34) and 5 (39) are lower.\n3. Since my outside option is 270, I need to give Player 2 a bundle whose expected value (from his unknown private values) is above his reservation level. Assuming a typical per\u2010unit value around 51 (the average of a uniform [1,101]) then roughly 6 units (\u201cvalue\u201d \u2248 306) should be enough.\n4. I choose to concede all of item 2 (all 3 units) since I value it less, and then only a minimal amount in items 4 and 5. For instance, giving Player 2 1 unit of item 4 and 2 units of item 5 sums to 3 extra units. Altogether this gives Player 2 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 units.\n5. My retained share is then: all of item 1 (5 units), all of item 3 (4 units), 3 of the 4 units of item 4, and 2 of the 4 units of item 5.

Accepting the current offer would give me only 49, whereas walking away ensures I get 609.\n\n### Potential Strategy for Counteroffer:\nIf I were to counteroffer, I need to offer Player 1 something that might be nearly as good to them as what they've proposed to me but still more valuable to me than 49:\n\n- Items with high value to me include Item 3 (77) and Item 1 (40).\n- The offer from Player 1 suggests they value Item 2 and Item 5 enough to take them all, albeit these are low value to me.\n\nConsider I offer the maximum of lower valued items (to me) and minimal of high valued:\n\n- **Proposed Counteroffer to Player 1:**\n  - Give: [0, 3, 1, 0, 2]\n  - Retain for myself: [5, 0, 3, 4, 2]\n\n**Value of Proposed Counteroffer to Me:**\n- Item 1: 5 units * 40 = 200\n- Item 2: 0 units * 2 = 0\n- Item 3: 3 units * 77 = 231\n- Item 4: 4 units * 39 = 156\n- Item 5: 2 units * 2 = 4\n\nTotal value of the counteroffer to me = 200 + 0 + 231 + 156 + 4 = 591\n\nThe proposed counteroffer still does not exceed my outside offer but is much better than the current offer from Player 1. However, since it\u2019s still below my outside option of 609 and we discount more after Round 1, this counteroffer is not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the considerably higher value of my outside option, the best action is to walk away from the negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Therefore, accepting the current offer would not be beneficial compared to walking away.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\nI should make a counteroffer that accounts for my outside offer value while still aiming to close the deal, to avoid an unfavorable WALK scenario in the future rounds.\n\nLet's aim for a value closer to my outside offer, assuming Player 1 might also have a high outside offer but potentially values different items. Given that my highest value items are items 5 and 4, I should try to retain more of these. \n\nA potential counteroffer could be to retain all of item 5 and item 4 and offer Player 1 more of the lower-valued items for me, namely item 1.

This means I would receive:  \n- 3 units of item 1 (4 total - 1 offered)  \n- 2 units of item 2 (3 total - 1 offered)  \n- 6 units of item 3 (7 total - 1 offered)  \n- 4 units of item 4 (5 total - 1 offered)  \n- 3 units of item 5 (5 total - 2 offered)  \n\nThe values are:  \n- Item 1: 3 units * 18 = 54  \n- Item 2: 2 units * 41 = 82  \n- Item 3: 6 units * 93 = 558  \n- Item 4: 4 units * 12 = 48  \n- Item 5: 3 units * 33 = 99  \n\nTotal value of current offer = 54 + 82 + 558 + 48 + 99 = 841\n\n**Step 2: Consider Outside Offer and Discounter Factor**  \nMy outside offer is 910, and accepting an offer now in round 1 does not suffer from a discount, so the value remains 841 if I accept now. Since 841 from the current offer is less than my outside offer of 910, accepting is not a good option now.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Need for a Counteroffer**  \nI need to create a counteroffer where my calculated value from items is higher than my outside offer of 910, while still being appealing enough for Player 1.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal**  \nTo achieve a higher value, I would attempt to adjust item distribution:\n\nOffer to Player 1: [2, 0, 0, 0, 2]  \nThis means I receive:  \n- 2 units of item 1 (4 total - 2 offered)  \n- 3 units of item 2 (3 total - 0 offered)  \n- 7 units of item 3 (7 total - 0 offered)  \n- 5 units of item 4 (5 total - 0 offered)  \n- 3 units of item 5 (5 total - 2 offered)  \n\nThe values become:  \n- Item 1: 2 units * 18 = 36  \n- Item 2: 3 units * 41 = 123  \n- Item 3: 7 units * 93 = 651  \n- Item 4: 5 units * 12 = 60  \n- Item 5: 3 units * 33 = 99  \n\nTotal value = 36 + 123 + 651 + 60 + 99 = 969  \n\nThis new offer provides me a value of 969, which is greater than my outside offer of 910.\n\n**Conclusion**: The counteroffer [2, 0, 0, 0, 2] is superior in value for me, and it's more than my outside option.

My total value if I got every item would be 1559, so I want to secure at least 917 for myself. (Recall my per\u2010unit values are: item1=79, item2=55, item3=82, item4=76, item5=24.) In a \u201cpackage\u2010deal\u201d I\u2019d like to keep most of those items that I value highly and offer items that I personally value less to the other player so that the package has enough attractiveness for them.\n\nOne natural idea is to \u201cclaim\u201d the items that have high value to me (items1, 3, and a good part of item4) while offering all of items I value less (items2 and 5) to Player 2. However, if I offered only those, Player 2\u2019s \u201cshare\u201d would have my estimated value of 220 (from item2) + 96 (from item5) = 316. That is likely too low compared to the expected level of their private outside offer (which on average is a moderate number relative to their full potential value). \n\nTo balance the trade\u2010off, I can \u201csacrifice\u201d a few additional units from a moderately valuable item (such as item4 or even one unit of item3) to increase the package value we offer to Player 2. In the proposal I settled on, I give Player 2:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item1: 0 units (so I keep the lone unit I value at 79)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item2: All 4 units (worth 4\u00d755 = 220 to me)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item3: 1 unit (worth 82 to me)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item4: 3 units (worth 3\u00d776 = 228 to me)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item5: All 4 units (worth 4\u00d724 = 96 to me)\n\nThen my allocated items become:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item1: 1 unit (79)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item2: 0 units (0)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item3: 3 units (3\u00d782 = 246)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item4: 8 units (8\u00d776 = 608)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item5: 0 units (0)\n\u2003Total = 79 + 246 + 608 = 933, which exceeds my fallback of 917.\n\nMeanwhile, the offer to Player 2 (by my estimate) is worth:\n\u2003220 (from item2) + 82 (from item3) + 228 (from item4) + 96 (from item5) = 626.\nThis is hopefully attractive relative to their outside offer.\n\nThus, given this reasoning I propose the following offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 1, 3, 4]}",

This offer value is unaffected by negotiation rounds.\n   - The value of receiving 6 from the current offer is significantly less than 527.\n\n3. **Effect of Discount Rate (Gamma = 0.9)**:\n   - The value in the second round would be multiplied by \\(0.9^{(2-1)} = 0.9\\), but it still results in \\(6 \u00d7 0.9 = 5.4\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion on Current Offer**:\n   - The current offer is worth only 5.4 compared to my outside offer of 527. Thus, accepting this offer is not beneficial.\n\n5. **Formulate a Counteroffer or Walk**:\n   - To make a counteroffer, it should be beneficial for me such that its discounted value in this round is greater than my outside offer, or at least closer to my optimum target.\n   - I must give Player 1 an offer that keeps enough value on my side, more than 527 or closer considering the discount.\n\n   - Let's calculate:\n     - If I keep 4 units of item 2, that alone has a value of 316 for me.\n     - If I keep 4 units of item 3, that adds 80.\n     - This sums up to 396, which is still below 527. \n     - Let's consider also keeping 2 units of item 5 for another 88, totaling 484.\n     - To reach or surpass 527, include some units of item 1. Keeping 5 units of item 1 contributes another 40, totaling 524. This is very close.\n\n6. **Counteroffer Strategy**:\n   - To make it closer to my target, I can propose offering Player 1 a split where:\n     - For me: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n     - Offer to Player 1: 4, 0, 0, 2, 4\n   \nThe counteroffer of [4, 0, 0, 2, 4] to Player 1 keeps me at a better position than just accepting the current offer or walking away according to my values and considering the discount rate.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 2, 4]}\n```",

The discount factor means that I should consider negotiating further since any agreement reached in the next rounds will only be slightly less valuable due to the 0.9 discount rate.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\n\nTo maximize my own values, I want to counteroffer giving Player 1 fewer valuable items:\n\n- Assign all of item 1 to Player 1, since it has the least total impact for us (it's just one unit, but proportionately gives little to Player 1).\n- Reduce the offer of item 5 to Player 1 to 2 units, retaining more for myself.\n- Give 1 unit of item 4 to Player 1.\n\n#### Counteroffer:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThis allocation would be as follows:\n\n- For Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n- For me: [0, 4, 3, 2, 4]\n\nCalculate the value I receive:\n\n- Item 1: 0 units * 43 = 0\n- Item 2: 4 units * 28 = 112\n- Item 3: 3 units * 83 = 249\n- Item 4: 2 units * 11 = 22\n- Item 5: 4 units * 21 = 84\n\nTotal value = 0 + 112 + 249 + 22 + 84 = 467\n\nWith this deal, I would get much more value than the current offer and also my outside offer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the potential for better value, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "The reasoning is as follows. My private values are: item1 = 47, item2 = 78, item3 = 40, item4 = 46, item5 = 45. (The totals are 4, 1, 4, 5, 3 respectively.) Accepting the current offer on the table \u2013 which gives me [1,1,2,2,0] \u2013 would mean I receive a total undiscounted value of\n\n\u2003\u20031\u00d747 + 1\u00d778 + 2\u00d740 + 2\u00d746 + 0\u00d745 = 47 + 78 + 80 + 92 = 297.\n\nSince we are in round 2, its present value is 297\u00d70.9 = 267.3. That is very poor compared to my outside offer of 545.\n\nTo have a negotiated deal that beats walking away, I must end up with (undiscounted) value v satisfying 0.9\u00d7v \u2265 545, i.e. v \u2265 about 606. (My full bundle is worth 791, so in principle I have room to \u201cbuy back\u201d almost everything if I make only minimal concessions.) \n\nI want to get as close as possible to all of the total 791 yet give Player 2 enough so that they would be willing to accept rather than \u201cwalk\u201d and get their own outside offer. Since my values attach a \u201ccost\u201d to each item (e.g. giving up 1 unit of item i costs me v\u1d62), I calculate that if I keep everything I get 791. In order to have at least 606 in my pocket, I have room to concede items with my own weighted cost of at most 791 \u2212 606 = 185. (In my calculations above I used the total 751 because I computed a different split in a first pass; reviewing my numbers, note that my full bundle is 791. In order to target a deal stronger than 545, the undiscounted value I take should be at least 606. Thus, the allowed \u201ccost\u201d is 791 \u2013 606 = 185.) \n\nHowever, it is also important to leave Player 2 with at least as attractive a package (from their perspective) as they\u2019d get if they walked. We do not know their private values or outside amount, but from the negotiation history we know that in Round 1 Player 2\u2019s counteroffer resulted in a deal where the offer on the table gave me [1,1,2,2,0] (and thus gave Player 2 the complement: [3,0,2,3,3]). That suggests that in their previous proposal they kept a considerably generous share. To try to \u201cimprove\u201d on that and entice an agreement in round 2, I want to offer Player 2 something \u201cbetter\u201d than the alternative where I keep so little (which gave me a very low 267 value). \n\nSince I want to maximize my own value we try to give away \u201ccheaper\u201d items (items for which my private value is lower) while keeping the expensive ones. Among my items the \u201ccheapest\u201d from my perspective is item3 (value 40), then roughly item4 (46) and item5 (45). Even giving a single unit of any of those \u201ccosts\u201d me 40\u201346 points. With my margin of concession roughly around 185 (or even less if I want more margin), I cannot give away extra whole units without reducing my own total below 606. \n\nA natural candidate is then to offer a concession of one unit in each of three of the \u201ccheaper\u201d categories. For example, if I offer Player 2 one unit of item3, one unit of item4, and one unit of item5 then my \u201ccost\u201d is 40 + 46 + 45 = 131. My remaining share becomes:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 4 (I give 0),\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 1 (I give 0),\n\u2003\u2003Item3: 4 \u2212 1 = 3,\n\u2003\u2003Item4: 5 \u2212 1 = 4,\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 3 \u2212 1 = 2.\nMy own undiscounted value is then:\n\u2003\u20034\u00d747 + 1\u00d778 + 3\u00d740 + 4\u00d746 + 2\u00d745 = 188 + 78 + 120 + 184 + 90 = 660.\nDiscounted by round 2\u2019s factor 0.9, that gives 660\u00d70.9 = 594, which beats my outside offer of 545.\n\nThis counteroffer gives Player 2 the package [0,0,1,1,1] (i.e. the number of units I give them). Although this is a considerably smaller allotment than the [3,0,2,3,3] in their earlier move, if they reject we would enter round 3 with a lower discount factor (0.81) and more uncertainty. So it is in both our interests to try to settle in round 2 with a deal that is acceptable to both sides.\n\nThus, my action is to propose a counteroffer declaring that I give Player 2 one unit each of items 3, 4, and 5.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\",\n  \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n}",

I must ensure the deal I get gives me more than my outside offer of 702 when discounted at round 1 (no discount loss).\n\u2022 My private per\u2010unit values are highest on item 1 (93) and item 4 (85). To maximize my value, I want to keep as many of those as possible. In contrast, I value item 2 less (56) so I can concede all or most of it.\n\u2022 A natural idea is to \u201cclaim\u201d the entire high\u2010value items for myself. Keeping all of item 1 (6 units) and item 4 (2 units) gives me 6\u00d793 + 2\u00d785 = 558 + 170 = 728, which is just above my fallback of 702.\n\u2022 However, if I offer nothing on item 1, player 2 might reject the deal if his private type is high on that item. Thus I add a minimal concession (1 unit) of item 1.\n\u2022 To further help player 2 reach a deal later than his outside offer (which on average is about half his total, say roughly 459), I also give him all of the lower\u2010valued item 2 (3 units) and most of item 3 and item 5.\n\u2022 One possibility that meets these criteria is to offer player 2: 1 unit of item 1, all 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3 (out of 4), and all 3 units of item 5. This leaves me with 5 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, both units of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n\u2022 My value from that allocation is 5\u00d793 + 1\u00d770 + 2\u00d785 = 465 + 70 + 170 = 705, which beats my outside offer.\n\u2022 Meanwhile, player 2 receives a share which, in expectation (with his values roughly averaging around 51), gives him around 510 in value\u2014a potentially attractive offer relative to his fallback.\n\u2022 Thus, in round 1 as Player 1 I make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 0, 3]}",

That means if I don\u2019t agree I\u2019d get 1155. Thus any deal I accept must give me a present\u2010value of at least 1155. Since my total \u201cpie\u201d is 1297, I have only 1297 \u2013 1155 = 142 \u201csurplus\u201d points available (by my own valuation) to share with Player\u202f2. Because my private values differ considerably (with items 3, 4, and 5 being very valuable to me), I want to keep nearly everything. The only \u201ccheaper\u201d item I have is item\u202f1 (worth 55 per unit to me). In fact, I can only afford to sacrifice (in my value) at most 2 units of item\u202f1 (2\u00d755=110) because 3 units would cost me 165\u2014dropping my own share below 1155. (Other items cost even more on my side.) \n\nThus, as an initial aggressive offer I propose giving Player\u202f2 2 units of item\u202f1 and keeping everything else. In my evaluation that means I keep: 8\u20132 = 6 units of item\u202f1 plus all of items 3, 4, and 5. That gives me a value of:\n\u2003\u20036\u00d755 + 3\u00d794 + 5\u00d773 + 3\u00d770 = 330 + 282 + 365 + 210 = 1187,\nwhich is just above my outside offer.

We should also consider the possibility of a counteroffer that maximizes my value while still being attractive enough for Player 1 to accept.\n\n**Current Offer (from Player 1):** [0, 5, 0, 4, 0]  \n- Item 1: 0 * 24 = 0  \n- Item 2: 5 * 13 = 65  \n- Item 3: 0 * 94 = 0  \n- Item 4: 4 * 66 = 264  \n- Item 5: 0 * 85 = 0  \n\nTotal Value of Current Offer = 0 + 65 + 0 + 264 + 0 = 329\n\nSince it's round 1, the discount factor \\( \\gamma^0 = 1 \\).\n\n**Outside Offer Value:** 694\n\nThe value of the current offer (329) is significantly lower than my outside offer (694). Therefore, accepting the current offer is not favorable.\n\n**Planning a Counteroffer:**\nThe goal is to increase my received value beyond my outside offer or to make a reasonable offer that Player 1 might accept. Given that I have a high value on items 3, 4, and 5, I should prioritize retaining these items. Let me propose the counteroffer:\n\nAttempting to claim more items that have higher valuation for me:\n- Item 1: Offer 3 (countering with 5 for myself)\n- Item 2: Offer 2 (countering with 3 for myself)\n- Item 3: Offer 0 (claiming all for myself)\n- Item 4: Offer 1 (countering with 3 for myself)\n- Item 5: Offer 0 (claiming the only unit for myself)\n\nMy counteroffer: [3, 2, 0, 1, 0]\n\n**Calculating My Potential Value:**\n- Item 1: 5 * 24 = 120  \n- Item 2: 3 * 13 = 39  \n- Item 3: 4 * 94 = 376  \n- Item 4: 3 * 66 = 198  \n- Item 5: 1 * 85 = 85  \n\nTotal Value of Counteroffer for Me = 120 + 39 + 376 + 198 + 85 = 818\n\nThis counteroffer potentially gives me a total value of 818, which is greater than my outside offer. Given that it's closer to a balanced division, Player 1 might consider it acceptable.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Similarly, item 5 is nearly as valuable for both (48 vs. about 51), making it less negotiable from my side.\n\u2022 In contrast, items 1, 2 and 3 give me relatively low value (7, 1 and 12 per unit respectively) compared to the likely higher values Player 2 might have (their values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101).

Therefore, accepting this offer would not be in my best interest.\n\n### Counteroffer Consideration:\nWhen considering a counteroffer, I need to ensure it possibly improves my position without me receiving unnecessary negative outcomes. I could aim to include more Item 5s because they have a considerable value for me that was not included in the current offer.\n\nGiven the previous offers:\n- My own previous counteroffer was: [0, 2, 3, 6, 0]\n\nI will adjust my counteroffer to receive better value, focusing on Item 3 and Item 5, which have higher per unit values for me. \n\n### Proposed Counteroffer:\nI'll make a more balanced and aggressive counteroffer, keeping some items at maximum values I offered before, to see if Player 1 is willing to concede on those:\n\n- Offer to Player 1: [0, 2, 2, 6, 1]\n\n#### My Calculation for my Proposal:\n- Player 1: 0 (item 1) + 2 (item 2) + 2 (item 3) + 6 (item 4) + 1 (item 5)\n- I get: 1 (item 1) + 0 (item 2) + 2 (item 3) + 0 (item 4) + 3 (item 5)\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 1 unit x 60 = 60\n- Item 3: 2 units x 52 = 104\n- Item 5: 3 units x 64 = 192\n\n**Total value of my counteroffer:**  \n60 (item 1) + 104 (item 3) + 192 (item 5) = 356\n\n- Discounted value of proposed counteroffer = 356 * 0.9 = 320.4\n\nThis does not reach my outside offer; however, it asserts pressure on Player 1.

Thus, I'll maximize the amount of item 1 I receive.\n\nProposing the counteroffer that keeps the majority of item 1 but sacrifices some others:\n- Proposed counteroffer: [3, 3, 2, 2, 0]\n\nThis means I am offering:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis reserves high-value items for me while still offering a significant share of goods to Player 1.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on these considerations and aims to increase my slice of high-value items or require Player 1 to give more, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

My total undiscounted value (if I got everything) is 681, so my allocation if I offer Player2 a vector x = [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5] gives me:\n\u2003\u2003[6\u2013x1, 3\u2013x2, 2\u2013x3, 3\u2013x4, 3\u2013x5]\nwith my undiscounted utility\n\u2003\u2003= 54\u00d7(6\u2013x1) + 6\u00d7(3\u2013x2) + 15\u00d7(2\u2013x3) + 40\u00d7(3\u2013x4) + 63\u00d7(3\u2013x5)\n\u2003\u2003= 681 \u2013 (54x1 + 6x2 + 15x3 + 40x4 + 63x5).\nTo beat my outside offer (after discounting) when finishing in round\u202f2 I want:\n\u2003\u20030.9\u00d7[my utility] > 303\u2003\u2192\u2003my utility > 303/0.9 \u2248 337.\n\u2022 At the same time, my counteroffer must be \u201cpalatable\u201d for Player2. Note that in the previous round Player2\u2019s offer (to me) resulted in them obtaining, by the complementary split, [3, 0, 0, 1, 3]. Thus a counteroffer that gives them roughly a similar \u201cbundle\u201d may be acceptable.\n\u2022 I therefore aim to get just above the minimum threshold \u2013 for example, a split in which I get an undiscounted value of about 338 (which discounted by 0.9 would be about 304, just above my outside option).\nOne balanced candidate is to offer Player2:\n\u2003\u2003[2, 1, 0, 1, 3]\nsince then my allocation is:\n\u2003\u2003Item1: 6\u20132 = 4\u2003 (4\u00d754 = 216)\n\u2003\u2003Item2: 3\u20131 = 2\u2003 (2\u00d76 = 12)\n\u2003\u2003Item3: 2\u20130 = 2\u2003 (2\u00d715 = 30)\n\u2003\u2003Item4: 3\u20131 = 2\u2003 (2\u00d740 = 80)\n\u2003\u2003Item5: 3\u20133 = 0\u2003 (0\u00d763 = 0)\nTotaling 216+12+30+80 = 338 (undiscounted), which gives 0.9\u00d7338 \u2248 304.2\u2014just above the outside offer.\nAt the same time Player2 would receive [2, 1, 0, 1, 3] (compared to their earlier complementary bundle of [3, 0, 0, 1, 3]).

Additionally, walking away at this point would secure me a value of 405 from my outside offer, which is still better than the current offer.\n\nTherefore, I should propose a counteroffer that could bring me an even higher value adjusted for the discount factor, closer to my total potential value of 808, or at least better than walking away.

Total = 9 * 93 = 837\n     - 0 units of item 2, worth 11 each. Total = 0\n     - 0 units of item 3, worth 71 each. Total = 0\n     - 0 units of item 4, worth 29 each. Total = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5, worth 33 each. Total = 0\n   - Total value of the offer to you = 837.\n\n2. **Comparison with Outside Offer**: Your outside offer is worth 174. The proposed offer significantly exceeds this value, making it very attractive relative to the alternative of walking away.\n\n3. **Discounting Factor**: Since it is the first round, the discounting factor is \\(\\gamma^{(r-1)} = \\gamma^{0} = 1\\). Therefore, the full value of 837 is applicable without any discounting.\n\nConclusion: Accepting this current offer of [9, 0, 0, 0, 0] provides a value of 837, which is considerably higher than the outside offer of 174. Accepting the current offer is a rational move based on maximizing the utility I would receive.\n\nGiven these calculations, the best action is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

My value per unit = 55, total = 55\n- **Item 5:** Offered 0 units. My value per unit = 93, total = 0\n\n**Total value of current offer = 5 + 47 + 59 + 55 + 0 = 166**\n\n### Discounted Value in Round 1:\n- Discount factor: \\( \\gamma^{0} = 1 \\)\n- Discounted value = 166 \\times 1 = 166\n\n### Compare with Outside Offer:\n- My outside offer value = 846\n\n### Decision Analysis:\n- The value of the current offer (166) is significantly lower than the value of my outside offer (846). Accepting this offer would be far worse than walking away with the outside offer.\n- A reasonable counteroffer should at least attempt to increase my value closer to or above the outside offer. \n\n### Counteroffer Strategy:\nTo make it acceptable for Player 1, I should attempt to make a realistic counteroffer that maximizes my total value without jeopardizing the negotiation entirely. An ideal strategy could involve adjusting item quantities such that my value is maximized.\n\n#### Calculate desirable allocation:\nGiven that I need to hit a value much higher than the current offer, I should aim for as much of the high-value items as possible:\n- **Item 5:** I put a very high value on item 5 (93), so I would like both units.\n- **Item 4:** Similarly, item 4 is highly valued to me (55). If player 1 keeps 1 unit.\n- **Item 3:** I value item 3 at 59 per unit, so we can leave player 1 2 units.\n- **Item 1:** Less valuable, leave 3 units to player 1.\n- **Item 2:** My value on this is somewhat high, but I will offer 1 unit.\n\nOffer: [3, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer:\n- **Item 1:** I offer 3 units to Player 1.\n- **Item 2:** I offer 1 unit to Player 1.\n- **Item 3:** I offer 2 units to Player 1.\n- **Item 4:** I offer 1 unit to Player 1.\n- **Item 5:** I offer 0 units to Player 1.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 1, 0]}",

To achieve more than 147 in value after discounting, I will aim for a pre-discount value of at least 147/0.9 \u2248 163.3.\n\n**Possible Counteroffer**\n- Offer Player 1 more of item type 1, since it is less valuable to me and valuable in terms of opportunities they have provided in prior rounds.\n\nA fair division where I get more value:\n- Give Player 1: [4, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nThis leaves me with:\n- Receive Myself: [2, 3, 4, 1, 1]\n\n**Value for Me from This Offer:**\n- Item 1: 2 units x 14 = 28\n- Item 2: 3 units x 3 = 9\n- Item 3: 4 units x 63 = 252\n- Item 4: 1 unit x 43 = 43\n- Item 5: 1 unit x 10 = 10\n\n**Total Value** = 342 (before discount)\n\nAdjusting for the discount: \n- 342 * 0.9 = 307.8 (which is far more than my outside offer)\n\nThus, this counteroffer gives me significantly more value than my outside offer and is a strategic response based on my valuations.\n\n### My Action:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Also, to make a valid counteroffer, I should ensure the total units taken from each item does not exceed the available inventory.\n\n2. My total optimum aim would be to reach a value of at least around 869 / (1 - 0.9) because 869 is the discounted value for each round. So reaching 965 in this round would convince me to not walk away.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\n\nTo attempt a balanced counteroffer, I aim to get more from Item 3 (my highest value item) while giving more from low-value items to Player 1.\n\nLet's propose:\n\n- Item 1: give 2 units (I keep 2)\n- Item 2: give 0 units (I keep 3)\n- Item 3: give 4 units (I keep 5)\n- Item 4: give 3 unit (I keep 1)\n- Item 5: give 1 unit (I keep 0)\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units * 51 = 102\n- Item 2: 3 units * 53 = 159\n- Item 3: 5 units * 88 = 440\n- Item 4: 1 unit * 24 = 24\n- Item 5: 0 units * 2 = 0\n\nTotal value for me = 102 + 159 + 440 + 24 + 0 = 725\n\nThis value seems less beneficial than my outside offer considering the discount factor;\n\nLet's try improving slightly within inventory:\n\nPropose:\n\n- Item 1: give 1 unit (I keep 3)\n- Item 2: give 0 units (I keep 3)\n- Item 3: give 4 units (I keep 5)\n- Item 4: give 3 unit (I keep 1)\n- Item 5: give 1 unit (I keep 0)\n\nValidate:\n\n- Item 1: 3 units * 51 = 153\n- Item 2: 3 units * 53 = 159\n- Item 3: 5 units * 88 = 440\n- Item 4: 1 unit * 24 = 24\n- Item 5: 0 units * 2 = 0\n\nThis still nets only 776, aiming for higher need distribution changed slightly, focusing on primary items of high value.\n\n**Counteroffer decides:**\n\nMe attempting for more units of Item 3 as its the most beneficial for me. Victory lies in cutting plausible set sharing generously, ensuring counterpart can't claim too much in return.\n\nThus, propose:\n\n- Item 1:  give 2 units\n- Item 2:  give 0 units\n- Item 3:  give 4 units\n- Item 4:  give 1 unit\n- Item 5:  give 1 unit\n\nNew Test Total:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units * 51 = 102\n- Item 2: 3 units * 53 = 159\n- Item 3: 5 units * 88 = 440\n- Item 4: 3 units * 24 = 72\n- Item 5: 0 units * 2 = 0\n\nArriving at 905 - holding above 869 permissible.\n\nTherefore, my counterproposal becomes a work-in deal satisfying need beyond acceptance.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 4, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means all items are proposed to go to Player 1, leaving me with nothing.\n   \n2. **Value of Goods if Accepted:**\n   - I receive 0 units of each item, so my total value from this offer is 0.\n\n3. **Considering Discount Factor:**\n   - Since it's round 1, the discount factor is \\(0.9^{0} = 1\\).\n   - The value of the current offer, if accepted, remains 0.\n\n### Outside Offer Evaluation:\n- **Value of My Outside Offer:** 379\n\nSince accepting the current offer gives me a value of 0, and my outside offer is 379, it is strategically unwise to accept such an offer as my outside value is substantially higher.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy:\n- I aim to make a counteroffer that provides me with a higher value than my outside offer while being reasonable enough to potentially entice acceptance from Player 1.\n- For my offer to Player 1, I have to consider retaining items that bring me high value: \n  - Item 4, worth 100 per unit to me, is the most valuable, and I potentially want most of these.\n  - Item 2, worth 63 per unit, is also highly valuable to me.\n\n### My Counteroffer Calculation:\n- I offer some units of less valuable items to Player 1 while keeping a significant portion of higher-value items for myself:\n  - Item 1: I offer 1 (receiving 28 total value, keeping one for myself).\n  - Item 2: I offer 0 (I want to retain both for maximum value).\n  - Item 3: I offer 4 (I keep 2 for a value of 56).\n  - Item 4: I offer 1 (I keep 2 for a value of 200).\n  - Item 5: I offer 2 (I receive value of 82, keeping two for myself).\n\nThe adjusted value for me with this distribution:\n- Total value of kept items = \\( (28 \\times 1) + (63 \\times 2) + (28 \\times 2) + (100 \\times 2) + (41 \\times 2) \\)\n- Total = 28 + 126 + 56 + 200 + 82 = 492\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The value of 492, adjusted after a possible rejection and moving to the next round (with a discount \\(0.9^1 = 0.9\\)), gives me 442.8, which is still greater than my outside offer of 379.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following counteroffer, seeking to maximize the potential value above my outside offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 4, 1, 2]}\n```",

Therefore, it would not be rational to accept this offer. Instead, I should aim to negotiate a better deal or walk away.\n\nTo create a counteroffer, I need to ensure the value I retain surpasses my outside offer if possible.\n\n### Reason for Counteroffer:\nTo make the counteroffer attractive while retaining a higher value, I will adjust the allocation:\n- I need to counteroffer in a way that maximizes the remaining value to myself compared to my outside option. \n\nAs part of this strategy, I\u2019ll aim to offer Player 1 items that hold less value for me, primarily item 4, while retaining more valuable items for me such as items 1, 3, and 5 to increase my returns.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer:\n- Offer Player 1:\n  - 1 unit of item 1: they clearly want item 1, so I'll keep this symmetrical\n  - 2 units of item 2: similar to what they want, maintaining symmetry for negotiation purposes\n  - 0 units of item 3: retaining for higher value\n  - 4 units of item 4: generally less valuable for me but ample quantity available\n  - 0 units of item 5: I\u2019ll keep this due to high value\n\nMy total retained value:\n- Item 1: 4 units = 4 * 86 = 344\n- Item 2: 3 units = 3 * 58 = 174\n- Item 3: 2 units = 2 * 83 = 166\n- Item 4: 1 unit = 1 * 9 = 9\n- Item 5: 2 units = 2 * 89 = 178\n\nTotal retained value = 344 + 174 + 166 + 9 + 178 = 871\n\nThe retained value (871) is still not quite enough, but it\u2019s better enough that we start leveraging the structure of our offers given the constraints and could improve next round.\n\nGiven the relatively low offer, I don't believe I'd get more from our initial rounds in Player 1's favor on my value basis, but I'll still be inclined to try.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 4, 0]}\n```",

(My private values are 75 for item 1, 67 for item 2, 28 for item 3, 31 for item 4, and 45 for item 5.) In making an initial offer I want to give Player 2 just enough \u201cstuff\u201d so that, on an expected\u2010value basis, their bundle will be in the neighborhood of what they might get from their outside option\u2014even after accounting for the fact that if the negotiation drags on the discount factor will lower values. (Their outside offer is unknown, but on average from a ~uniform[1,total] draw their expected outside value is roughly half of their total possible value; roughly speaking that comes out to be around 860\u2013900 in many cases.) \n\nBecause I value items 1 and 2 highly (75 and 67 per unit) I would like to keep those for myself. On the other hand, items 3 and 4 are relatively \u201ccheap\u201d for me (28 and 31) so it is natural to assign them entirely to Player 2. That gets them 8 units of item 3 and 7 units of item 4. This bundle (15 units) would roughly be worth 15\u00d7~51 \u2248 765 in expectation (if we use 51 as a representative average value) which is a bit on the low side compared to the outside option. To help bridge that gap, I will also offer a small part of item 5 (which for me is 45/unit, intermediate, so I\u2019m willing to offer only a few) so that the opponent\u2019s \u201cpackage\u201d is more competitive. If I give 2 units of item 5 then Player 2\u2019s entire allocation becomes 8+7+2 = 17 units. At an average (unknown) per\u2010unit value of roughly 51, that package is worth about 867 \u2013 roughly matching what many opponents might expect from their outside offer.\n\nUnder this proposal my allocation is:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1: all 3 units (I keep them)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: all 9 units (I keep them)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 for me (8 to them)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 0 for me (7 to them)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 7\u20132 = 5 units for me\n\nMy resulting value (using my private values) is 3\u00d775 + 9\u00d767 + 5\u00d745 = 225 + 603 + 225 = 1053, which is well above my outside offer (747). Meanwhile, Player 2\u2019s offer should be on the borderline of their outside option if, as is typical on average, they do not have extremely high private values for the items I am keeping.\n\nThus my initial offer is to give Player 2 the following allocation: 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 8, 7, 2]}",

My total value from this offer is 0.\n\n4. **Total Value of All Items for Me:** \n   - Item 1: 2 units * 89 = 178\n   - Item 2: 3 units * 26 = 78\n   - Item 3: 3 units * 11 = 33\n   - Item 4: 4 units * 81 = 324\n   - Item 5: 5 units * 16 = 80\n   - Total Value = 693\n\n5. **Round 1 Situation:** \n   - The current offer from Player 1 is not acceptable as it provides me with 0 value, far less than my outside offer of 618.\n   - I should definitely not accept this offer, as my outside option (618) is significantly better.\n\n6. **Counteroffer Strategy:**\n   - The negotiation game has a discount factor, which means delaying the resolution impacts the final value. However, we do not need to worry about discounting until subsequent rounds.\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that makes sense where both parties get less than their private total values but potentially more than their outside options, although I can only assume Player 1's outside option might be lower than their total value, which is unknown.\n\n7. **My Counteroffer Calculation:**\n   - Aim to retain items that maximize my value or require fewer units to achieve a high total.\n   - For instance, securing Items 1 and 4 provides substantial value right away due to their high unit values.\n\n8. **Formulation of a Counteroffer:**\n   - Offer Player 1 more items for negotiation but insure that my received items exceed my outside offer.\n   - I should find an offer where I still receive substantial value, while giving Player 1 what might be reasonably acceptable.\n\n   A good starting point might be:\n   - Give 0 of Item 1 (since it has highest individual value for me).\n   - Offer most or all of Items 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n   Then, compute values:\n   - Proposed Counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 3, 3, 2, 5]\n     Thus, I keep: [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n   Calculating my potential value from this:\n   - Item 1: 2 * 89 = 178\n   - Item 4: 2 * 81 = 162\n   - Total Value = 178 + 162 = 340 (non-discounted for Round 1)\n   \n   This strategy aims for negotiations but still protects my interests with my outside offer. It may require further adjustments based on Player 1's responses in subsequent rounds.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll proceed with the following action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 2, 5]}\n```",

Consider making a counteroffer:**\n\n- My goal is to make a counteroffer that has a value greater than 256 after adjusting for the discount factor (0.9) for the next round.\n\nLet's see my total value for each item:\n\n- Item 1: 7 * 36 = 252\n- Item 2: 7 * 44 = 308\n- Item 3: 4 * 24 = 96\n- Item 4: 3 * 11 = 33\n- Item 5: 6 * 41 = 246\n\nTotal potential value = 252 + 308 + 96 + 33 + 246 = 935\n\n**4.

Our private valuation per item is as follows:\n- Item 1: 25\n- Item 2: 51\n- Item 3: 6\n- Item 4: 10\n- Item 5: 49\n\nConsidering we need to aim for a value higher than 816, let's craft a counteroffer:\n\n- We can give up items with lower personal value (e.g., item 3 and some item 4) and aim for a greater share of items with higher value per unit to us (item 2 and item 5).\n\nHere\u2019s a possible counteroffer aiming for at least a total value close to our outside offer:\n\n- Item 1: 8 (keeping 4 for myself)\n- Item 2: 0 (keeping all 5 units as it has high value to me)\n- Item 3: 1 (I can give up more of item 3 given its low value)\n- Item 4: 1 (keeping 2, as it's of moderate value)\n- Item 5: 0 (keeping all 6 units due to high value to us)\n\nCounteroffer Evaluation:\n- Value for us with the counteroffer:\n  - Item 1: 25 x 4 = 100\n  - Item 2: 51 x 5 = 255\n  - Item 3: 6 x 3 = 18\n  - Item 4: 10 x 2 = 20\n  - Item 5: 49 x 6 = 294\n\n  Total value for us = 100 + 255 + 18 + 20 + 294 = 687\n\nThe counteroffer still doesn't exceed our outside option, but it approaches a potentially higher value while being more strategic with potential further offers. However, the consideration becomes balancing for the next rounds or potentially negotiating for the value.\n\nGiven the situation, I will not take the current offer or make a counteroffer not exceeding a strategic position as this.

Accepting this deal is not beneficial as it provides less value than walking away and accepting my outside offer.\n\n7. **Strategy Going Forward:**\n   - Since the current offer is low, I will not accept it.\n   - I should make a counteroffer that reflects higher value items according to my evaluations. \n   - It's important to secure a value higher than my outside offer if possible, but at minimum consider compromise as rounds progress.\n\nGiven these observations, I will make a counteroffer focusing on retaining high-value items for myself. I need to ensure Player 1 is getting something valuable to them, while still maximizing my own value.\n\n**Counteroffer:**\n- I will offer Player 1 items that may be of interest, keeping higher value items for myself:\n  - Offer Player 1: [3, 0, 2, 1, 4] \n\nThis means:\n- I give Player 1:\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\nThis counteroffer balances my need to retain valuable items according to my values and provides Player 1 with a mixture potentially appealing to them based on their initial offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 1, 4]}",

This is the minimum amount we should consider because it is what we can secure by walking away.\n\n### Discounting Factor\nThe importance of the discount factor (gamma = 0.9) influences our evaluation only if the rounds proceed further. In the first round, it is not yet a factor because there has been no discount applied.\n\n### Decision\n- The current offer gives us a value of 26, which is much less than our outside offer of 312.\n- Accepting the offer is not preferable as our value from it is far less than our outside offer.\n- Walking away gives us a guaranteed value of 312, which is currently better.\n  \nSince the current offer does not meet even our outside offer value, and since we should aim to receive more value than 312 by the end of the negotiation to make it worthwhile compared to walking away, we need to make a counteroffer that reflects our need for a higher value.\n\n### Counteroffer Strategy\nWe aim to maximize our value while presenting a reasonable division to Player 1.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer that reflects these considerations:\n- Ensure a higher personal value than from walking away.\n- Aim for reasonable sharing to encourage a deal.\n\nConsidering our values, we focus on high-value items for us:\n- Prioritize items 2 and 3, as they have the highest individual value.\n\n#### Proposed Counteroffer\nLet's offer Player 1 some units of items with lesser priority to us:\n\n- Offer 3 units of item 1 (leaving us 3 units).\n- Offer 0 units of item 2 (we want all, highest value item).\n- Offer 1 units of item 3 (giving us 2, second highest value item).\n- Offer 2 units of item 4 (we keep 2 units).\n- Offer 2 units of item 5 (we keep 2 units).\n\nHere's the counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

Items 4 and 5 have lower value (15 and 12 per unit) so they are \u201ccheaper\u201d for me but still attractive to an opponent whose unknown values average about 51 per unit.\n3. I need to get at least 827 in my own payoff (my outside offer). By keeping full items 2 and 3 and most of item 1 I can reach that.\n4. One feasible division is to keep nearly all items 2 and 3 and give the opponent most of items 4 and 5 and only a little of item 1. For example, by offering Player 2 one unit of item1, no units of items 2 and 3, but all of the eight units of item4 and all four units of item5, I calculate:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 My share: item1: 4\u20131 = 3 units, item2: 6, item3: 3, item4: 0, item5: 0.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 My payoff = 3\u00d724 + 6\u00d783 + 3\u00d799 = 72 + 498 + 297 = 867, which is above my outside offer value of 827.\n5. The opponent\u2019s offer from receiving 1 unit of item1, 8 of item4 and 4 of item5 (total 13 units) has an expected worth around 13\u00d751 \u2248 663, which should be competitive with their expected outside offer.\n6.

Although Player 2\u2019s private values are unknown, this initial offer leaves little room for them to claim an even split; if necessary, we can adjust later rounds.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 5, 0]}",

By analyzing my highest value items, and previous offerings:\n   - Item 4 is highly valued by me, so I should try to keep as much of it as possible.\n   - Let's adjust the offer, keeping most of item 4 for myself and attempting to balance the remaining items to see if I can improve my position while making the offer potentially appealing to Player 1.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\nI can offer a new distribution, aiming to keep most of item 4 while adjusting the rest:\n\n- Offer [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] to Player 1.\n\n1. **My Proposed Allocation:**\n   - Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2 units left (value: 52)\n   - Item 2: 4 - 0 = 4 units left (value: 72)\n   - Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units left (value: 58)\n   - Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3 units left (value: 171)\n   - Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units left (value: 64)\n  \n   Total my proposed value = (52 + 72 + 58 + 171 + 64) = 417\n\nThe counteroffer gives me a value of 417, which is more than the current offer (372) and closer to my outside offer (461).

Since it's still the first round, the discount factor is \u03b3^(0) = 1. Therefore, the adjusted value of the offer to me is directly 438.\n\nNext, compare this value to my outside offer value:\n\n- My outside offer value: 408\n\nThe value of the current offer (438) is higher than my outside option (408). Thus, accepting this offer would give me higher value than walking away.\n\nConsidering these calculations, since the offer on the table benefits me more than my outside offer value, the rational choice in this situation is to accept the offer given by Player 1.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

The current offer (56) is significantly lower than my outside offer, as it only gives me a small portion of my potential value (which was 1028 initially).\n\n### Strategy for Counteroffering\n\nTo form a counteroffer, I need to balance providing a fair offer to Player 1 and maximizing my own value above the outside offer. \n\nGiven my values, a potential starting point could be offering the items with lower value to me, meaning keeping more of the high-value items for myself.\n\n### Formulation of a Counteroffer\n\nA plausible counteroffer strategy could involve offering:\n- Some items to improve Player 1\u2019s value while keeping my higher-value items.\n- Attempting to achieve a value above 599 for myself.\n\nTo do this, let's retain a majority but grant some concessions:\n- Offer 2 units of Item 1 (lower value, helps Player 1's offer)\n- Offer 3 units of Item 2 (more than what Player 1 currently offers)\n- And 0 units of other items to retain their potential value to me.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\n- [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\nNow, I'll calculate my potential retention value (my items):\n\n- Item 1: (5 - 2) * 37 = 111\n- Item 2: (6 - 3) * 56 = 168\n- Item 3: (3 - 1) * 33 = 66\n- Item 4: (4 - 0) * 68 = 272\n- Item 5: (4 - 0) * 34 = 136\n\nTotal potential value = 753\n\n### New Offer Calculation with Discount\n\nAdjusted for Round 2 (if my offer were somehow accepted immediately in this round):\n- Discount adjustment not applied directly yet, counteroffer to negotiate further.\n\nSince the potential self-value from this offer is above my outside offer and allows for potential acceptance in further negotiations:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]}",
