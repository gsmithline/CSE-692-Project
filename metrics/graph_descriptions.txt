1. Discounted Values Over Time: 
This graph tracks how each player values the proposed divisions over time. 
Blue lines represent Player 1's perspective, while red lines represent Player 2's. 
Circles (○) indicate offers made by Player 1, while squares (□) show Player 2's counter-offers. 
The downward trend in values over rounds reflects the time discount factor (γ), 
showing how delay reduces the ultimate value of any agreement. 


2. Offer Evolution Plot
This visualization shows how players propose to divide each item type across rounds. 
Each subplot represents one item type, with the y-axis showing how many units are 
offered to Player 2. Blue lines track Player 1's offers, while red lines show Player 
2's counter-offers. Converging lines indicate agreement on that item's distribution, 
while diverging lines highlight items under contention. This helps identify which 
items are causing negotiation friction and how preferences for different 
items evolve during bargaining.

3. Negotiation Gap Plot 
This plot measures the relative difference in value between players' positions, 
normalized by their total value. The green line shows (P1_value - P2_value)/(P1_value + P2_value), 
with positive values indicating Player 1 getting more value and negative values favoring Player 2. 
Values closer to zero suggest more balanced offers. The trend over rounds shows whether players are moving 
toward or away from equitable solutions, with circles and squares distinguishing between P1 and P2's offers respectively.

4. Basic Fairness Plot
This visualization shows how the total value is split between players over time. 
Blue lines show Player 1's share of total value, red lines show Player 2's share, 
and a green dashed line marks the 50-50 split reference point. Circles indicate P1's offers, 
squares show P2's counter-offers. This helps assess whether the negotiation is trending 
toward a fair division of value or if one player is consistently capturing more value than the other. 
The plot reveals potential power imbalances and whether players are prioritizing fairness in their negotiations.
