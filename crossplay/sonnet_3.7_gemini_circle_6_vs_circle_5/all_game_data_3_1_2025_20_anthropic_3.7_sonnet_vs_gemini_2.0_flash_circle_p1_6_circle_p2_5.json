Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 467. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 34 x 2 + 90 x 1 + 86 x 3\n    which is 466 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 467. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 645. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 738 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 645.\n*   My values for items 1-5 are 2, 97, 1, 60, 86, respectively.\n*   The total pool of items is 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that a deal in the next round is worth 90% of what it would be worth this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   3 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    My value for this offer would be: (0 * 2) + (1 * 97) + (3 * 1) + (1 * 60) + (1 * 86) = 0 + 97 + 3 + 60 + 86 = 246.\n    This is less than my outside offer of 645.\n\n*   **Consider Player 1's Round 1 offer of [1,2,3,1,1]:** This means I would receive:\n    * 1 units of item 1\n    * 2 units of item 2\n    * 3 units of item 3\n    * 1 unit of item 4\n    * 1 unit of item 5\n    My value for this offer would be: (1*2) + (2*97) + (3*1) + (1*60) + (1*86) = 2 + 194 + 3 + 60 + 86 = 345.\n    This is less than my outside offer of 645.\n\n*   **Consider my Round 1 offer of [2,1,5,1,1]:** This means Player 1 received:\n    * 2 units of item 1\n    * 1 unit of item 2\n    * 5 units of item 3\n    * 1 unit of item 4\n    * 1 unit of item 5\n    This means I keep:\n    * 0 units of item 1\n    * 2 units of item 2\n    * 0 units of item 3\n    * 2 units of item 4\n    * 4 units of item 5\n    My value for this would be (0 * 2) + (2 * 97) + (0 * 1) + (2 * 60) + (4 * 86) = 0 + 194 + 0 + 120 + 344 = 658.\n    This is more than my outside offer of 645.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me more than 645. Let's consider keeping everything:\n    * 2 units of item 1 = 2 * 2 = 4\n    * 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 97 = 291\n    * 5 units of item 3 = 5 * 1 = 5\n    * 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 60 = 180\n    * 5 units of item 5 = 5 * 86 = 430\n    Total = 4 + 291 + 5 + 180 + 430 = 910\n\n    Now let's try to offer something reasonable to Player 1. We need to give away enough that Player 1 will accept, but not so much that I fall below 645.\n    Let's try offering [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n    * 2 units of item 1\n    * 3 units of item 2\n    * 3 units of item 3\n    * 3 units of item 4\n    * 5 units of item 5\n    My value is (2*2) + (3*97) + (3*1) + (3*60) + (5*86) = 4 + 291 + 3 + 180 + 430 = 908. This is well above my outside offer, so it's a good start.\n\n    How about offering [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]?\n    Then I keep:\n    * 2 units of item 1\n    * 3 units of item 2\n    * 2 units of item 3\n    * 3 units of item 4\n    * 5 units of item 5\n    My value is (2*2) + (3*97) + (2*1) + (3*60) + (5*86) = 4 + 291 + 2 + 180 + 430 = 907. This is also pretty good.\n\n    How about offering [0,1,3,1,1]? Which is the amount Player 1 offered to me this round.\n    If I offer this, then I keep:\n    * 2 units of item 1\n    * 2 units of item 2\n    * 2 units of item 3\n    * 2 units of item 4\n    * 4 units of item 5\n    My value is (2*2) + (2*97) + (2*1) + (2*60) + (4*86) = 4 + 194 + 2 + 120 + 344 = 664. This is above my outside offer.\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer gives me 246, which is much worse than my outside offer of 645. Therefore, I should not accept.\nI believe I can get a better offer than my outside offer.\n\nI will counteroffer [0,1,3,1,1] which gives me a value of 664 if it is accepted.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let me analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) Current situation analysis:\n- My outside offer value is 354.\n- My private values are: 72 for item 1, 10 for item 2, 57 for item 3, 24 for item 4, 8 for item 5.\n- The total pool of items is: 7 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n- We're in round 2, so the discount factor (0.9) will apply once if we conclude in this round.\n\n2) Value assessment:\n\nCurrent offer evaluation (what Player 2 offers me):\nPlayer 2 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], meaning I would keep [6, 3, 0, 1, 0].\nValue to me: (6 \u00d7 72) + (3 \u00d7 10) + (0 \u00d7 57) + (1 \u00d7 24) + (0 \u00d7 8) = 432 + 30 + 0 + 24 + 0 = 486\nWith discount: 486 \u00d7 0.9 = 437.4\nThis is better than my outside offer of 354.\n\nLet me look at Player 2's behavior so far:\n- I initially offered them [2, 3, 0, 0, 0], keeping [5, 1, 0, 1, 0] for myself.\n- They countered with [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], wanting [6, 3, 0, 1, 0] for themselves.\n\nThis suggests they value item 1 highly (they want 6 units) and item 2 moderately (they want 3 units).\n\n3) Decision making:\nLet me consider a counteroffer that would be more favorable to me while still being potentially attractive to Player 2:\n\nPotential counteroffer: [1, 2, 0, 0, 0] - giving Player 2 one unit of item 1 and two units of item 2.\nThis means I keep [6, 2, 0, 1, 0].\nValue to me: (6 \u00d7 72) + (2 \u00d7 10) + (0 \u00d7 57) + (1 \u00d7 24) + (0 \u00d7 8) = 432 + 20 + 0 + 24 + 0 = 476\nWith discount (if accepted next round): 476 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 0.9 = 385.56\n\nThis is still better than my outside offer, and it's more favorable than accepting their current offer.\n\nHowever, there's a risk that if I counter now, we might end up with no deal if Player 2 walks away in the next round.\n\nGiven that their current offer already gives me a value of 437.4 after discount (which is significantly better than my outside offer of 354), and we're already in round 2, the safest strategy is to accept their offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 556. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 1, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 3 + 66 x 3 + 69 x 1 + 69 x 2 + 12 x 4\n    which is 555 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 556.

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. This means I would receive those items.\n      - My value for this offer is (0 * 8) + (0 * 43) + (0 * 83) + (0 * 67) + (4 * 22) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 88 = 88.\n   - This value of 88 is much lower than my outside offer of 394.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n    Let's examine the consequences of offering the other player some of the items while keeping others to myself. My goal is to find a division that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 394.\n   Let's start by evaluating the alternative where I offer Player 1 nothing. The value of the offer to me is:\n   (3 * 8) + (4 * 43) + (1 * 83) + (2 * 67) + (1 * 22) = 24 + 172 + 83 + 134 + 22 = 435\n   This value of 435 is greater than my outside offer of 394.\n\n   However, offering nothing to the other player in round 1 is suboptimal and may cause them to walk away from negotiations. Let's consider another possible offer where I keep 2 units of Item 1, 2 Units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 Unit of Item 4, and 1 unit of Item 5. I would then offer the remainder of the items to the other player: 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 Units of Item 3, 1 Unit of Item 4, and 4 Units of Item 5. The value of this division to me is:\n   (2 * 8) + (2 * 43) + (1 * 83) + (1 * 67) + (1 * 22) = 16 + 86 + 83 + 67 + 22 = 274. This is less than my outside offer so is not a viable candidate.\n\n   Let's consider offering Player 1 1 Unit of Item 1, 1 Unit of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, and 0 Units of Item 5. This leaves me with 2 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 1 Unit of Item 3, 2 Units of Item 4 and 5 Units of Item 5. The value of this allocation for me is:\n    (2 * 8) + (3 * 43) + (1 * 83) + (2 * 67) + (5 * 22) = 16 + 129 + 83 + 134 + 110 = 472\n    This is larger than my outside offer so is a viable candidate.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is much worse than my outside offer.\n   - I could propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away guarantees me my outside offer.\n\nGiven the options, I will propose a counteroffer that gives the other player 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This will give me a value of 472.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 556. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 556. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 1, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 3 + 66 x 3 + 69 x 1 + 69 x 2 + 12 x 4\n    which is 555 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 556. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 34. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 50 x 0 + 47 x 0 + 99 x 0 + 22 x 1\n    which is 22 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 34. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 7, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 7, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 3, 4, 0, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 units\n    My value for this offer is: (2 * 60) + (3 * 60) + (4 * 52) + (0 * 73) + (1 * 37) = 120 + 180 + 208 + 0 + 37 = 545\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (545) is significantly lower than my outside offer (1023).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1023.\n    Let's consider keeping [1, 5, 0, 4, 1] for myself:\n    *   Item 1: 1 * 60 = 60\n    *   Item 2: 5 * 60 = 300\n    *   Item 3: 0 * 52 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 4 * 73 = 292\n    *   Item 5: 1 * 37 = 37\n    Total: 60 + 300 + 0 + 292 + 37 = 689.

This offer is better than the outside offer. The counteroffer to Player 1 would be [0, 0, 4, 0, 0].\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is very bad. A counteroffer of [0, 0, 4, 0, 0] results in me keeping [3, 8, 0, 4, 2] items, with a value of 1026.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 458. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 450 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 6, 1, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 2 + 35 x 6 + 10 x 1 + 65 x 3 + 19 x 0\n    which is 457 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 458. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 4, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 54. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 561 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 22 x 1 + 15 x 2 + 57 x 0 + 71 x 0\n    which is 52 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 54. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 4, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 4, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 383. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 383. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 3, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 3 + 17 x 0 + 2 x 3 + 51 x 2 + 34 x 0\n    which is 378 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 383. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 200. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 25 x 0 + 63 x 3 + 40 x 0\n    which is 189 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 200. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Assessing values and developing a strategy\n\nSince this is the first round, there's no offer to consider accepting. I need to make a good first offer.\n\nWhat if I offer 1-2 units of each valuable item to the other player while keeping the most valuable for myself?\n\nLet me try keeping most of item 2 (my highest value) and a good portion of item 4:\n- If I keep [0, 5, 0, 2, 1] and offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]:\n  - My value: 5\u00d782 + 2\u00d763 + 1\u00d740 = 410 + 126 + 40 = 576\n  - This is significantly better than my outside offer of 200\n\nLet me try another option:\n- If I keep [0, 4, 0, 2, 1] and offer [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]:\n  - My value: 4\u00d782 + 2\u00d763 + 1\u00d740 = 328 + 126 + 40 = 494\n  - Still much better than my outside offer\n\nLet me try being more generous to set a cooperative tone:\n- If I keep [0, 4, 0, 2, 1] and offer [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]:\n  - My value: 4\u00d782 + 2\u00d763 + 1\u00d740 = 328 + 126 + 40 = 494\n  - This is still more than double my outside offer value\n\n## 3. Decision\n\nSince item 2 has the highest value for me at 82 per unit, I want to keep most of those units. Item 4 is my second most valuable at 63 per unit. I'll offer a balanced division that keeps my best items while appearing fair to the other player.\n\nI'll propose keeping 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5, offering the rest to the other player.\n\nThis means I'm offering them:\n[0, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nThis gives me a value of 494, which is well above my outside offer of 200.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 431. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 431. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 606 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 53 x 5 + 3 x 0 + 44 x 2 + 36 x 2\n    which is 425 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 431. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 542. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 624 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 7, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 7 x 7 + 59 x 3 + 45 x 7\n    which is 541 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 542. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 748. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 558 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 3, 1, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 4 + 55 x 2 + 10 x 3 + 17 x 1 + 58 x 7\n    which is 747 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 748. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the optimal action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 748\n   - My values for items: Item 1: 46, Item 2: 55, Item 3: 10, Item 4: 17, Item 5: 58\n   - Total items: Item 1: 7, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 8, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 7\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 8, 0, 2]. This means I would receive 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n     Value of current offer:\n     (2 * 46) + (0 * 55) + (8 * 10) + (0 * 17) + (2 * 58) = 92 + 0 + 80 + 0 + 116 = 288\n\n   - This value of 288 must be considered alongside the discount factor: since this is round 2 the value is 288 * 0.9^(2-1) = 288 * 0.9 = 259.2\n     Since the value of the current offer with discount is much lower than my outside offer of 748, accepting this would be a mistake.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to construct a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer. Let's see what my value would be if I kept everything:\n      (7 * 46) + (2 * 55) + (8 * 10) + (3 * 17) + (7 * 58) = 322 + 110 + 80 + 51 + 406 = 969\n\n   - The total value is 969. I need to make sure that any counteroffer I give results in me retaining at least 748.\n   - Suppose I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 969, which is fine, but it might lead Player 1 to WALK.\n   - I have to offer something to Player 1. Since Item 3 has a low value to me, perhaps that would be the place to start.\n\n   - Let's try to give Player 1 an offer such that I get at least 748 in value. Let's keep:\n    - 7 units of Item 1: 7*46 = 322\n    - 2 units of Item 2: 2*55 = 110\n    - 0 units of Item 3: 0 * 10 = 0\n    - 0 units of Item 4: 0 * 17 = 0\n    - 7 units of Item 5: 7 * 58 = 406\n    Total Value = 322 + 110 + 0 + 0 + 406 = 838\n    In this case, I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 8, 3, 0]\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   - I should not walk away immediately as there is still one more round to negotiate, and some counteroffers will return me more value than my outside offer\n   - I should propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 8, 3, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 185. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 40 x 1 + 72 x 2 + 97 x 0 + 37 x 0\n    which is 184 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 185. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to determine the best initial offer based on my values and outside offer.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 185\n- My item values:\n  * Item 1: 22 per unit (5 units total = 110)\n  * Item 2: 40 per unit (4 units total = 160)\n  * Item 3: 72 per unit (4 units total = 288)\n  * Item 4: 97 per unit (2 units total = 194)\n  * Item 5: 37 per unit (3 units total = 111)\n- Total items to divide: [5,4,4,2,3]\n- Total value of all items: 863\n- The discount factor is 0.9, meaning offers in future rounds will be worth less\n\n## Step 2: Assess potential offers\n\nI should make an initial offer that maximizes my value while potentially being acceptable to the other player. I need to ensure that the value I keep is greater than my outside offer of 185.\n\nLet me consider keeping the most valuable items for myself:\n- Item 4 is most valuable at 97 per unit - I should aim to keep both units\n- Item 3 is next at 72 per unit - I should try to keep most or all units\n- Item 2 is worth 40 per unit\n- Item 5 is worth 37 per unit\n- Item 1 is least valuable at 22 per unit - I can offer more of these\n\nA potential initial offer giving Player 2 [3,2,1,0,1]:\n- I keep: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n- My value: (2\u00d722) + (2\u00d740) + (3\u00d772) + (2\u00d797) + (2\u00d737) = 44 + 80 + 216 + 194 + 74 = 608\n- This is well above my outside offer of 185\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nThe offer [3,2,1,0,1] gives me a value of 608, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 185. It also gives Player 2 some items of each type (except item 4), which might make it more appealing.\n\nSince this is just the opening offer, I can start with a somewhat aggressive position but not so extreme that it offends Player 2. This offer keeps my most valuable items (3, 4) while giving away more of my less valuable items (1).\n\nTherefore, I'll make a counteroffer where I give Player 2 [3,2,1,0,1], meaning I keep [2,2,3,2,2] for myself.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3,2,1,0,1]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 46 x 2 + 14 x 4 + 55 x 3\n    which is 313 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 314. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer on the table is [3, 2, 1, 2, 0]. This means I receive 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for this offer is: (3 * 9) + (2 * 85) + (1 * 46) + (2 * 14) + (0 * 55) = 27 + 170 + 46 + 28 + 0 = 271.\n    *   Since 271 is less than my outside offer of 314, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what my value would be for different proposed divisions.  Let's start by figuring out what I would get if I took everything that wasn't offered to me. Player 1 has proposed that I receive [3, 2, 1, 2, 0].\n    *This means player 1 receives [1, 0, 4, 4, 5].\n    *Therefore, I would keep [3,2,1,2,0] for myself.\n    *This is worth 271 (as shown above).\n\n    Let's consider a different counteroffer where I offer Player 1 a small number of items and see if I can get a better value for myself than my outside offer. I want to prioritize keeping items with a high value for myself.\n    For example, consider if I offered the other player the following allocation:\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    That is, I offer Player 1 zero of everything and keep everything for myself. Then, my value would be:\n    (4 * 9) + (2 * 85) + (5 * 46) + (6 * 14) + (5 * 55) = 36 + 170 + 230 + 84 + 275 = 795.\n    This is significantly better than my outside offer of 314.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer (271) is worse than my outside offer (314), so I should not accept.\n*   I can make a counteroffer that is significantly better than my outside offer, so I will make a counteroffer.\n*   I will make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 3, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 1 + 94 x 5 + 50 x 3 + 93 x 3 + 14 x 1\n    which is 946 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 947. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 359. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 89 x 2 + 76 x 1 + 12 x 2 + 40 x 2\n    which is 358 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 359. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 381. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 816 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 87 x 2 + 36 x 1 + 84 x 2\n    which is 378 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 381. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the optimal action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 381\n*   **Values of the items:**\n    *   Item 1: 24\n    *   Item 2: 41\n    *   Item 3: 87\n    *   Item 4: 36\n    *   Item 5: 84\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 0\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 3\n    *   Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of accepting in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times the value of accepting in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 0 units\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n\n    The value of this offer to me is: (0 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (2 * 87) + (0 * 36) + (2 * 84) = 0 + 0 + 174 + 0 + 168 = 342\n    Comparing to my outside offer: 342 < 381. Accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to make a counteroffer that gives me more than 381. Since it is round 1, there is more benefit in trying to secure a better offer to me, as the discount factor won't affect the current turn. Let's consider keeping all of item 3 and item 5.\n\n* Counteroffer 1: Give all items to Player 1\n    * I receive [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    * Value: 0\n    * This is clearly worse than the outside offer\n\n* Counteroffer 2: Keep all of the items myself\n    * I receive [3, 0, 3, 3, 2]\n    * Value: (3 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (3 * 87) + (3 * 36) + (2 * 84) = 72 + 0 + 261 + 108 + 168 = 609\n    * This is much greater than the outside offer\n\n* Counteroffer 3: Give Player 1 items [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    * I keep [3, 0, 3, 3, 2]\n    * My value: 609\n\n* Counteroffer 4: Give Player 1 items [3, 0, 3, 3, 2]\n    * I keep [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    * My value: 0\n\n* Counteroffer 5: Give Player 1 items [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n    * I keep [3, 0, 2, 3, 2]\n    * Value: (3 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (2 * 87) + (3 * 36) + (2 * 84) = 72 + 0 + 174 + 108 + 168 = 522\n\n* Counteroffer 6: Give Player 1 items [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n    * I keep [3, 0, 3, 3, 1]\n    * Value: (3 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (3 * 87) + (3 * 36) + (1 * 84) = 72 + 0 + 261 + 108 + 84 = 525\n\nI need to ensure the counteroffer is better than my outside option (381).\n\nLet's offer Player 1 one unit of item 1, one unit of item 3 and one unit of item 4:\n* Offer to Player 1: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n* I keep: [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n* Value to me: (2 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (2 * 87) + (2 * 36) + (2 * 84) = 48 + 0 + 174 + 72 + 168 = 462\n\nLet's offer Player 1 one unit of item 1 and one unit of item 5:\n* Offer to Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n* I keep: [2, 0, 3, 3, 1]\n* Value to me: (2 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (3 * 87) + (3 * 36) + (1 * 84) = 48 + 0 + 261 + 108 + 84 = 501\n\nLet's offer Player 1 one unit of item 3 and one unit of item 5:\n* Offer to Player 1: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n* I keep: [3, 0, 2, 3, 1]\n* Value to me: (3 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (2 * 87) + (3 * 36) + (1 * 84) = 72 + 0 + 174 + 108 + 84 = 438\n\nOkay, let's try offering: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n* I keep: [3, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n* Value: (3 * 24) + (0 * 41) + (2 * 87) + (2 * 36) + (1 * 84) = 72 + 0 + 174 + 72 + 84 = 402\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 342 to me, which is less than my outside offer of 381. Therefore, I should not accept it. I can make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. After some calculations, a reasonable counteroffer is [0, 0, 1, 1, 1], which gives me a value of 402.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 1 + 98 x 0 + 89 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 15 x 0\n    which is 14 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 15. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Item 1: 12 per unit\n\nLet me try to keep most of the high-value items (2 and 3) and offer more of the lower-value items:\n\nInitial counteroffer idea: [1, 1, 0, 2, 4]\nThis means I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 12 = 0\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 84 = 420\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\nTotal value = 899\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer of 389.\n\nLet me check if this is a valid offer (making sure I'm not offering more than what's available):\n- Item 1: Offering 1 out of 1 unit \u2713\n- Item 2: Offering 1 out of 6 units \u2713\n- Item 3: Offering 0 out of 3 units \u2713\n- Item 4: Offering 2 out of 4 units \u2713\n- Item 5: Offering 4 out of 7 units \u2713\n\n## 3) Decision:\nMy counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 2, 4]:\n- Keeps the highest value items (most of item 2 and all of item 3)\n- Gives me a value of 899, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 389\n- Offers the other player some units of each item type except item 3\n- Gives more of the lower-valued items to the other player\n\nThis seems like a reasonable starting offer that protects my interests while still giving the other player something to consider.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 2, 4]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 1 + 54 x 1 + 4 x 2 + 91 x 4 + 32 x 2\n    which is 505 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 506. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 506\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 15, Item 2: 54, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 91, Item 5: 32\n*   **Total items:** 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    Value of current offer to me: (3 * 15) + (2 * 54) + (2 * 4) + (2 * 91) + (1 * 32) = 45 + 108 + 8 + 182 + 32 = 375\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** 375 < 506. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider some potential counteroffers and their values to me. I want to ensure my counteroffer gives me a value greater than my outside offer.\n\nIf I offer player 1 nothing: I keep everything\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 unit\n    Value to me: (3 * 15) + (3 * 54) + (3 * 4) + (5 * 91) + (2 * 32) = 45 + 162 + 12 + 455 + 64 = 738\nIf I offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]: my value is 738\nIf I offer player 1 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]: my value is (2*15) + (2*54) + (2*4) + (4*91) + (1*32) = 30+108+8+364+32 = 542\n\nI want to make a counteroffer that gives me value greater than 506.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. Offering nothing to Player 1 is probably a bad move. I should aim for something in between. I should consider the discount factor.\nSince it is the first round, and the current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer. I want to see if I can get a better deal by making a counter offer.\nMy target for the counteroffer needs to be above 506\n\nLet's try offering [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\nValue to me: (2 * 15) + (2 * 54) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 91) + (1 * 32) = 30 + 108 + 8 + 273 + 32 = 451. This is lower than 506\n\nLet's try offering [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\nValue to me: (2 * 15) + (3 * 54) + (3 * 4) + (4 * 91) + (2 * 32) = 30 + 162 + 12 + 364 + 64 = 632.

Analyzing the Current Situation\n\n- My outside offer value is 522\n- My private values per item are:\n  - Item 1: 88 per unit (3 units total)\n  - Item 2: 73 per unit (3 units total)\n  - Item 3: 56 per unit (3 units total)\n  - Item 4: 44 per unit (5 units total)\n  - Item 5: 13 per unit (2 units total)\n- We are in round 2, so the discount factor will be \u03b3^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n## 2. Assessing the Value of Offers\n\n### Current offer from Player 2:\nPlayer 2 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], which means I would keep [2, 3, 3, 4, 2].\n\nValue to me:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 44 = 176\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n- Total value = 765\n\nWith discount factor: 765 \u00d7 0.9 = 688.5\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 522.\n\n### My previous offer:\nI previously offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 1], which means I would keep [3, 2, 2, 2, 1].\n\nValue to me:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n- Total value = 623\n\nWith discount: 623 \u00d7 0.9 = 560.7\n\n### Player 2's preferences:\nBased on their offer, Player 2 seems to value:\n- Items 2, 3, and 5 highly (offered me none)\n- Items 1 and 4 less (offered me some)\n\n## 3. Decision Making\n\nThe current offer from Player 2 gives me a value of 688.5, which is much better than my outside offer of 522. \n\nHowever, I could potentially get more by making a counteroffer. Since Player 2 seems to value items 2, 3, and 5 highly, I could keep more of items 1 and 4 while giving them more of what they value.\n\nLet me calculate a potential counteroffer: [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\nThis means I would keep [2, 1, 1, 3, 1].\n\nValue to me:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 73 = 73\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n- Total value = 450\n\nWith discount: 450 \u00d7 0.9 = 405\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 522, so this isn't a good counteroffer.\n\nLet me try another counteroffer: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nThis means I would keep [3, 2, 2, 3, 1].\n\nValue to me:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n- Total value = 667\n\nWith discount: 667 \u00d7 0.9 = 600.3\n\nThis is better than my outside offer, but still less than Player 2's current offer to me.\n\nGiven that Player 2's offer gives me a value of 688.5, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 522, and any counteroffer I make might risk this good deal, the rational choice is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Based on my item values:\n\n- Item 3 is worth very little to me (only 2 points)\n- Items 2 and 4 are my most valuable (73 and 76 points per unit)\n- Items 1 and 5 are moderately valuable (28 and 53 points per unit)\n\nSince I want to maximize my value while making an acceptable offer to Player 2, I should:\n- Keep most of the high-value items (2 and 4)\n- Offer the low-value item 3\n- Split the moderately valuable items\n\nLet me try an initial offer where I give Player 2:\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nThis means I keep:\n[1, 2, 0, 3, 1]\n\nValue to me of what I keep:\n(1\u00d728) + (2\u00d773) + (0\u00d72) + (3\u00d776) + (1\u00d753) = 28 + 146 + 0 + 228 + 53 = 455\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 395.\n\nLet me double-check this is fair enough to potentially be accepted:\n- I'm offering Player 2 one unit each of items 2, 3, 4, and 5\n- I'm keeping all of item 1 (but there's only 1 unit)\n- The total items I'm offering is 4 out of 11 total items\n\nThis is a reasonable opening offer that favors me but still gives Player 2 something to work with.\n\n### 3) Decision:\nI'll make a counteroffer giving Player 2:\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nWhile keeping for myself:\n[1, 2, 0, 3, 1]\n\nThis gives me a value of 455, which is better than my outside offer of 395, and offers Player 2 a variety of items to start our negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 1 + 98 x 1 + 45 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 71 x 0\n    which is 106 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 110.

This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n*   Current offer to me: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] means I get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n*   My value for this offer: (0 * 8) + (1 * 98) + (1 * 45) + (1 * 26) + (1 * 71) = 0 + 98 + 45 + 26 + 71 = 240.\n\nSince 240 is greater than my outside offer of 110, accepting this offer is better than walking away immediately.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nI could potentially get an even better deal by making a counteroffer. Let's explore some possibilities, keeping in mind the goal of maximizing my value while avoiding the common mistakes. I want to keep as much of item 2 as possible and also a good portion of items 3 and 5.\nHere's a possible starting point for a counteroffer, trying to secure a larger share for myself:\nI offer Player 1 [1, 2, 1, 3, 1].\n\nThis means I keep [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nMy value for this is 1*98 + 1*26 + 1*71 = 195.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 110. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 744 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 1 + 98 x 1 + 45 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 71 x 0\n    which is 106 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 110. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 110\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 8, Item 2: 98, Item 3: 45, Item 4: 26, Item 5: 71\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 1, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 0].  This means I get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 8 = 8\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 98 = 98\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 26 = 26\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 71 = 0\n    *   Total value = 8 + 98 + 45 + 26 + 0 = 177\n\nSince this is round 2, the discounted value of accepting this offer is 177 * (0.9^(2-1)) = 177 * 0.9 = 159.3.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get with different counteroffers and how they compare to my outside offer (110) and the current offer (159.3).\n\nLet's consider a few scenarios, keeping in mind I need to offer *something* reasonable to Player 1, as offering nothing or everything is suboptimal:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Trying to get more of item 2:** I have 3 units of item 2, with high value. Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 2, 0], meaning I keep [1, 3, 1, 2, 2]. My value would be 1*8 + 3*98 + 1*45 + 2*26 + 2*71 = 8 + 294 + 45 + 52 + 142 = 541. Discounted value is 541*0.9=486.9.\n*   **Scenario 2: Trying to get more of item 5:** I have 2 units of item 5, with decent value. Let's try offering [0, 1, 0, 2, 0], meaning I keep [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]. My value would be 1*8 + 2*98 + 1*45 + 2*26 + 2*71 = 8 + 196 + 45 + 52 + 142 = 443. Discounted value is 443 *0.9 = 398.7\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a discounted value of 159.3, which is higher than my outside offer of 110.\nScenario 1 has discounted value 486.9\nScenario 2 has discounted value 398.7\n\nConsidering I want to maximize my value of the outcome of the negotiation game, and given the current offer yields a discounted value of 159.3, higher than my outside option, I will accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 8, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 36 x 0 + 82 x 3 + 13 x 8 + 23 x 0\n    which is 350 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 353. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 8, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 36 x 0 + 82 x 3 + 13 x 8 + 23 x 0\n    which is 350 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 353. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 7, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 549\n   - Item values: item 1 = 53, item 2 = 88, item 3 = 7, item 4 = 73, item 5 = 97\n   - Total items: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer now is worth more than the same offer next round (by a factor of 0.9).\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 0, 6, 1]. This means I get:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 0 unit of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n\n     My value for this offer is: (1 * 53) + (1 * 88) + (0 * 7) + (6 * 73) + (1 * 97) = 53 + 88 + 0 + 438 + 97 = 676\n     Since 676 > 549 (my outside offer), accepting this offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n   - **Previous offer:** I offered [4, 0, 3, 3, 0] to Player 1. This means I kept [0, 2, 0, 6, 2] which has a value of (0 * 53) + (2 * 88) + (0 * 7) + (6 * 73) + (2 * 97) = 0 + 176 + 0 + 438 + 194 = 808\n     My value for my previous round offer was 808. Player 1 rejected my counteroffer and made an offer to me of value 676.\n\n   - **Counteroffers:** Let's explore some counteroffers. I need to give *something* to Player 1.\n\n     - Consider offering player 1 [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]. This leaves me with [3, 2, 3, 6, 2]. The value of this division to me is (3 * 53) + (2 * 88) + (3 * 7) + (6 * 73) + (2 * 97) = 159 + 176 + 21 + 438 + 194 = 988\n     - Consider offering player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This leaves me with [4, 2, 3, 9, 2]. The value of this division to me is (4 * 53) + (2 * 88) + (3 * 7) + (9 * 73) + (2 * 97) = 212 + 176 + 21 + 657 + 194 = 1260\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer of 676 is better than my outside offer of 549.\n   - However, I could potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer.\n   - If I accept the current offer, my value is 676.\n   - If I walk away, my value is 549.\n   - If I make a counteroffer, there's a risk Player 1 walks away or makes a bad offer *next round* which would be discounted by a factor of 0.9. My value for the above counteroffer if accepted would be 988.\n   - It's round 2, so there is only one round to go after this round.\n\nLet's consider offering [1, 0, 0, 4, 0]. This offer is better than the current offer on the table. If I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 4, 0], this means I get [3, 2, 3, 5, 2]. This has a value of 3*53 + 2*88 + 3*7 + 5*73 + 2*97 = 159 + 176 + 21 + 365 + 194 = 915.\nIf Player 1 accepts, then I get 915.\n\nLet's consider offering [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]. This offer is better than the current offer on the table. If I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 3, 0], this means I get [3, 2, 3, 6, 2]. This has a value of 3*53 + 2*88 + 3*7 + 6*73 + 2*97 = 159 + 176 + 21 + 438 + 194 = 988.\nIf Player 1 accepts, then I get 988.\n\nLet's consider offering [1, 0, 0, 5, 0]. This offer is better than the current offer on the table. If I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 5, 0], this means I get [3, 2, 3, 4, 2]. This has a value of 3*53 + 2*88 + 3*7 + 4*73 + 2*97 = 159 + 176 + 21 + 292 + 194 = 842.\nIf Player 1 accepts, then I get 842.\n\nIt is probably worth the risk of making a better counteroffer because the potential gains exceed the loss from the discount factor.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 7, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 0, 3, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 6, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this carefully to determine the best course of action.\n\n### 1) Analyzing the current situation:\n- My outside offer value: 353\n- My item values: 49 for item 1, 36 for item 2, 82 for item 3, 13 for item 4, 23 for item 5\n- Total items: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n- This is round 3, so any deal will be multiplied by \u03b3\u00b2 = 0.81 (0.9\u00b2)\n- Player 2's current offer to me is [1, 0, 0, 3, 0], meaning I keep [3, 2, 3, 6, 2]\n\n### 2) Assessing the value of offers:\n\nValue of Player 2's current offer to me:\n- I keep: [3, 2, 3, 6, 2]\n- Value: (3\u00d749) + (2\u00d736) + (3\u00d782) + (6\u00d713) + (2\u00d723) = 147 + 72 + 246 + 78 + 46 = 589\n- With discount factor: 589 \u00d7 0.81 = 476.9\n\nCompared to my outside offer of 353, accepting is better.\n\nLet's analyze Player 2's behavior:\n- They initially offered me all of items 1, 3, and none of item 2, 5\n- Their second offer reduced what they were giving me of item 1 and 4\n- They seem to value item 2 and 5 highly, and don't value item 3 at all\n- They're willing to give me some of item 1 and item 4\n\n### 3) Decision:\n\nSince this is the final round and Player 2's offer gives me a value of 476.9 (after discount), which is significantly better than my outside offer of 353, I should ACCEPT.\n\nMaking a counteroffer at this point would be risky since if Player 2 doesn't accept, the game ends with a WALK and I'd only get my outside offer value.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
