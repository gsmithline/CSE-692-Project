My total \u201cfull\u2010value\u201d for all items is 1212 so if I finally get a deal at full value (round 1, no discount) then I must get items worth at least 1071. In other words, I must \u201cconcede\u201d no more than 1212 \u2013 1071 = 141 in my own value when giving some items to Player\u00a01.\n\nPlayer\u00a01\u2019s round\u20111 offer was to give me [1, 3, 1, 0, 2] (so that Player\u00a01 would keep the remainder). That deal would give me \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a01: 1\u00d78 = 8  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a02: 3\u00d755 = 165  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a03: 1\u00d743 = 43  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a04: 0\u00d735 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a05: 2\u00d782 = 164  \nfor a total of 380, which is far below 1071. (Thus I must do something \u201cshrewd\u201d with my counteroffer.)\n\nIn a counteroffer I \u201cchoose\u201d what to give to Player\u00a01. The convention is that I specify a list [n1, n2, n3, n4, n5] where these n\u2019s are the numbers of units going to Player\u00a01; then my share is the remaining units:\n\u2003\u2003item\u00a01: 3 \u2013 n1  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a02: 3 \u2013 n2  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a03: 5 \u2013 n3  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a04: 2 \u2013 n4  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a05: 9 \u2013 n5.\nMy own value (using my private per\u2010unit values) is \n\u2003\u20031212 \u2013 (8\u00d7n1 + 55\u00d7n2 + 43\u00d7n3 + 35\u00d7n4 + 82\u00d7n5).\nSince I require my deal value to be at least 1071, I must have \n\u2003\u20038\u00d7n1 + 55\u00d7n2 + 43\u00d7n3 + 35\u00d7n4 + 82\u00d7n5 \u2264 141.\nAt the same time I want to \u201cbuy\u201d as much extra value as possible relative to my outside option. In a first round (with no discounting yet) I have an incentive to claim nearly all the \u201cpie\u201d (all items) while still leaving Player\u00a01 an \u201cenough\u201d share so that they will accept (rather than waiting and getting their outside offer or a potentially even better counteroffer later when discounting reduces all outcomes).\n\nA simple proposal is to offer Player\u00a01 one unit of item\u00a01 and one unit of item\u00a05. In my values that \u201cconcession\u201d is \n\u2003\u20038 (for 1 unit of item 1) + 82 (for 1 unit of item 5) = 90,\nwhich is below the 141 \u201climit.\u201d Then my allocation would be\n\u2003\u2003item\u00a01: 3 \u2013 1 = 2  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a02: 3 \u2013 0 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a03: 5 \u2013 0 = 5  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a04: 2 \u2013 0 = 2  \n\u2003\u2003item\u00a05: 9 \u2013 1 = 8.\nMy total value is then 1212 \u2013 90 = 1122, safely above my outside offer. (Player\u00a01\u2019s values are unknown, but given that discounting will hurt future rounds and that they already initiated an offer, a modest concession like this may be acceptable.)\n\nThus my counteroffer is to offer Player\u00a01: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",
