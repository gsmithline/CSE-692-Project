                    "response": "Okay, let's start by considering my outside offer of 1016. I need to make an offer that I believe Player 2 will accept, and that also gives me a value greater than 1016. Since this is the first round, and I have a discount factor of 0.9, I should aim for an offer that gets me a value greater than 1016.\n\nI need to estimate Player 2's values to make a reasonable offer. Lacking that information, a good starting point is to offer a split that seems somewhat fair. Let's try offering Player 2 half of each item, rounded down since we can only deal in integers. That means:\n\nItem 1: 6 units / 2 = 3 units\nItem 2: 7 units / 2 = 3 units\nItem 3: 2 units / 2 = 1 unit\nItem 4: 6 units / 2 = 3 units\nItem 5: 7 units / 2 = 3 units\n\nSo, I would offer Player 2 [3, 3, 1, 3, 3]. Let's calculate the value this would leave me:\n\nItem 1: 3 units * 84 = 252\nItem 2: 4 units * 38 = 152\nItem 3: 1 units * 53 = 53\nItem 4: 3 units * 65 = 195\nItem 5: 4 units * 13 = 52\nTotal Value: 252 + 152 + 53 + 195 + 52 = 704\n\nThis offer leaves me with a value of 704, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 1016. Therefore, I need to revise my offer. I will calculate an offer where I give up less value than I did in my initial estimate.\n\nLet's try giving Player 2:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 2 units\nItem 3: 0 unit\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nMy offer to player 2 will be [2, 2, 0, 2, 2]. Now I need to calculate my own value from this scenario:\nItem 1: 4 * 84 = 336\nItem 2: 5 * 38 = 190\nItem 3: 2 * 53 = 106\nItem 4: 4 * 65 = 260\nItem 5: 5 * 13 = 65\nTotal: 336 + 190 + 106 + 260 + 65 = 957\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 1016. I will now give away even less to player 2. Let's try giving Player 2:\n\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nMy offer is [1, 1, 0, 1, 1].\n\nItem 1: 5 * 84 = 420\nItem 2: 6 * 38 = 228\nItem 3: 2 * 53 = 106\nItem 4: 5 * 65 = 325\nItem 5: 6 * 13 = 78\nTotal: 420 + 228 + 106 + 325 + 78 = 1157\n\nThis is now greater than my outside offer of 1016.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means they are offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n*   Item 1: 0 * 84 = 0\n*   Item 2: 1 * 38 = 38\n*   Item 3: 2 * 53 = 106\n*   Item 4: 6 * 65 = 390\n*   Item 5: 7 * 13 = 91\nTotal value of the offer: 0 + 38 + 106 + 390 + 91 = 625\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor. Since it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So the present value of this offer is 625 * 0.9 = 562.5\n\nMy outside offer is worth 1016. Since the present value of Player 2's offer (562.5) is significantly less than my outside offer, I should not accept it.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. The total units available are 6 of item 1, 7 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 7 of item 5. Let's try to come up with an offer that gives Player 2 enough to accept, while maximizing my value.\n\nI believe my best strategy is to offer player 2 a deal that is only slightly better than what they would get from walking away. Since it is round 2, their potential future earnings are discounted by 0.9. However, without knowing their valuation, I cannot be certain what offer they would accept.\n\nSince it is round 2, and I am at a disadvantage by not knowing player 2's valuation, I will make an offer that gives the other player the majority of the items.\n\nI will offer Player 2: [4, 5, 1, 4, 5]. This would leave me with [2, 2, 1, 2, 2].\nMy value for this:\n*   Item 1: 2 * 84 = 168\n*   Item 2: 2 * 38 = 76\n*   Item 3: 1 * 53 = 53\n*   Item 4: 2 * 65 = 130\n*   Item 5: 2 * 13 = 26\nTotal value = 168 + 76 + 53 + 130 + 26 = 453\nDiscounted value = 453 * 0.9 = 407.7\n\nSince my discounted value of 407.7 is still significantly less than my outside offer of 1016, I need to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

My outside option is 969.\n\nI need to estimate what a reasonable offer might be. I don't know Player 2's values, but I can assume they are drawn from the same distribution as mine (1-101). To make an informed decision, I'll make an offer that gives Player 2 slightly more than half the total possible value, but leaves me with at least my outside option.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I want to maximize my own value, but I also need to make an offer that Player 2 might accept. A reasonable strategy is to start with a somewhat fair offer and adjust based on Player 2's response.  I don't know Player 2's values, so a truly fair offer is impossible to determine, but I can aim for a split that gives them approximately half the total value *if* they valued items similarly to me.\n\nLet's aim to give Player 2 items that are less valuable to me.  Items 1 and 4 are my lowest value items.\n\nI'll start by offering Player 2:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 units\n*   Item 2: 3 units\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 3 units\n*   Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 1 unit * 4 = 4\n*   Item 2: 4 units * 56 = 224\n*   Item 3: 3 units * 98 = 294\n*   Item 4: 1 unit * 56 = 56\n*   Item 5: 2 units * 99 = 198\nTotal Value for me: 4 + 224 + 294 + 56 + 198 = 776\n\nValue for Player 2 according to me:\nItem 1: 4 * 4 = 16\nItem 2: 3 * 56 = 168\nItem 3: 2 * 98 = 196\nItem 4: 3 * 56 = 168\nItem 5: 1 * 99 = 99\nTotal value to player 2 according to me is: 16 + 168 + 196 + 168 + 99 = 647\n\nThis gives me a bit more than half, but is still a substantial offer for Player 2.

Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of accepting the current offer is 160 * 0.9 = 144.\n\nMy outside offer is 132. Since 144 > 132, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *if* there is no better counteroffer. Let's consider a counteroffer that gives player 2 all the items.\n\nIf I give Player 2 everything, that's [0, 2, 5, 4, 0]. My value would be 0, and the discounted value would also be 0. This is worse than my outside offer.\n\nIs it worthwhile to make a counteroffer? Round 3 will be the last round, and if Player 2 makes an offer then, it is effectively a walk. My value of accepting now (144) is very close to my outside option (132). \nLet's try making a minimal change to see if it is accepted.\nCounteroffer: I'll offer the other player almost everything.\n[0, 1, 5, 3, 0] means I get\n* 0 units of item 1: 0 * 99 = 0\n* 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 2 = 2\n* 0 units of item 3: 0 * 19 = 0\n* 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 79 = 79\n* 0 units of item 5: 0 * 41 = 0\nTotal value = 81\nDiscounted value = 81 * 0.9 = 72.9\n\nThis is even worse.

                    "response": "Okay, let's think this through. I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. My goal is to maximize my discounted value, taking into account my outside offer of 702.\n\nSince this is the first round, there's no previous offer to react to. I need to decide on an offer that is attractive enough for Player 2 to accept, but also leaves me with a good amount of items. A fair starting point might be to offer Player 2 roughly half of the total value. Let's try to craft an offer that gives player 2 a value of roughly 400, and see if we can make it work. Note, I don't know Player 2's values, so I need to make an offer that is likely to be attractive.\n\nI have: 3 of item 1 (value 3), 3 of item 2 (value 85), 5 of item 3 (value 43), 1 of item 4 (value 84), and 3 of item 5 (value 96).\n\nLet's start by offering a significant portion of item 5, since that is my highest-valued item. Let's offer Player 2 2 of item 5. This represents a value of 2 * 96 = 192 for me, if I were to give that up. Let's also offer one of item 2: 85. The value of item 4 is also relatively high for me, at 84, but there's only one of item 4.\nNow we are at 192 + 85 = 277. We can offer 3 of item 3 (giving Player 2 3, and keeping 2 for myself): this comes to 3*43=129. So the offer will be something like: [0, 1, 3, 0, 2]\n\nThis leaves me with:\n3 of item 1 = 3 * 3 = 9\n2 of item 2 = 2 * 85 = 170\n2 of item 3 = 2 * 43 = 86\n1 of item 4 = 1 * 84 = 84\n1 of item 5 = 1 * 96 = 96\nTotal value = 9 + 170 + 86 + 84 + 96 = 445\n\nThis isn't enough to beat my outside offer of 702. Let's be more aggressive and offer: [0, 1, 3, 0, 1].\nI get:\n3 of item 1 = 3 * 3 = 9\n2 of item 2 = 2 * 85 = 170\n2 of item 3 = 2 * 43 = 86\n1 of item 4 = 1 * 84 = 84\n2 of item 5 = 2 * 96 = 192\nTotal value = 9 + 170 + 86 + 84 + 192 = 541\n\nStill below. Let's offer the player the whole set of item 3 and item 5. Offer: [0, 1, 5, 0, 3].\nThis leaves me:\n3 of item 1 = 3 * 3 = 9\n2 of item 2 = 2 * 85 = 170\n0 of item 3 = 0 * 43 = 0\n1 of item 4 = 1 * 84 = 84\n0 of item 5 = 0 * 96 = 0\nTotal value = 9 + 170 + 0 + 84 + 0 = 263\n\nThis is too low. Let's try a different approach. I'll offer them my lowest value item and half of my next lowest. I'll offer: [3, 1, 0, 0, 0].\nThis gives me:\n0 of item 1 = 0\n2 of item 2 = 170\n5 of item 3 = 215\n1 of item 4 = 84\n3 of item 5 = 288\nTotal value = 0 + 170 + 215 + 84 + 288 = 757.

This means:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units\n*   Item 2: 0 units\n*   Item 3: 5 units\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 0 units\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 * 3 = 9\n*   Item 2: 0 * 85 = 0\n*   Item 3: 5 * 43 = 215\n*   Item 4: 1 * 84 = 84\n*   Item 5: 0 * 96 = 0\n\nTotal value of the current offer = 9 + 0 + 215 + 84 + 0 = 308\n\nNow, since we are in round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nSo, the present value of the current offer is 308 * 0.9 = 277.2\n\nMy outside offer value is 702. Since 277.2 < 702, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer something that Player 2 might accept. My goal is to get the highest possible value for myself while still exceeding Player 2's outside offer.\n\nSince I value Item 5 the highest, let's see if I can get all the units of that, while giving up some more of other items to Player 2.\nI have 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping all item 5 and maximizing my value:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 * 3 = 9\n*   Item 2: 3 * 85 = 255\n*   Item 3: 5 * 43 = 215\n*   Item 4: 1 * 84 = 84\n*   Item 5: 3 * 96 = 288\nTotal Value to me: 9 + 255 + 215 + 84 + 288 = 851\ndiscounted by 0.9, I get 851 * 0.9 = 765.9\n\nThe current offer gives me a discounted value of 277.2.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 all of item 1, all of item 3, and all of item 4. I keep item 2 and item 5.\nMy offer to Player 2: [3, 0, 5, 1, 0]\nThis would leave me with : [0, 3, 0, 0, 3]\nMy value: 0 * 3 + 3 * 85 + 0 * 43 + 0 * 84 + 3 * 96 = 0 + 255 + 0 + 0 + 288 = 543\ndiscounted value = 543 * 0.9 = 488.7. This is still less than my outside option so this is not a good counteroffer\n\nIf I counteroffer the other agent [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] that means I get everything, so my total value will be\n3 * 3 + 3 * 85 + 5 * 43 + 1 * 84 + 3 * 96 = 9 + 255 + 215 + 84 + 288 = 851\ndiscounted by 0.9, I get 851 * 0.9 = 765.9\nThis is higher than my outside option of 702.\n\nHowever, it is likely that player 2 will walk away as this offers them nothing. So perhaps a more reasonable approach is required.\n\nMy current value is 277.2. Let's walk through a few options of what to offer to Player 2 and see the outcome.\n\nLet's offer Player 2 items worth more to them than to me, while trying to stay above my outside offer.\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [1, 1, 3, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, it is round 3. I need to decide whether to accept the current offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer. The current offer gives me:\n*   Item 1: 1 unit\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 0 units\n*   Item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy values for these items are:\n*   Item 1: 3\n*   Item 2: 85\n*   Item 3: 43\n*   Item 4: 84\n*   Item 5: 96\n\nSo the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 3) + (1 * 85) + (1 * 43) + (0 * 84) + (1 * 96) = 3 + 85 + 43 + 0 + 96 = 227\n\nSince this is round 3, I need to consider the discount factor. My value is 227 * (0.9^(3-1)) = 227 * (0.9^2) = 227 * 0.81 = 183.87\n\nMy outside offer is 702. Since 183.87 is less than 702, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow let's consider a counteroffer. Since this is the last round, any counteroffer from Player 2 will be treated as a walk away. Therefore, the best I can do is try to get as close to the optimal split as possible while still being better than my walk away value of 702 * (0.9^2) = 702 * 0.81 = 568.62.\n\nI have 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\nTotal value: (3 * 3) + (3 * 85) + (5 * 43) + (1 * 84) + (3 * 96) = 9 + 255 + 215 + 84 + 288 = 851\n\nIf I offer Player 2 zero of everything, then my value is 851 * (0.9^2) = 851 * 0.81 = 690.31. This is better than 568.62, so a counteroffer can potentially get me a better outcome.\n\nThe items that Player 2 values the most are unknown. But, let's calculate how much I value giving them 1 of each:\n3 + 85 + 43 + 84 + 96 = 311\n851 - 311 = 540. So if I give them 1 of each, my value goes down to 540.\n540 * (0.9^2) = 540 * 0.81 = 437.4. Still not enough.\n\nThe difference between the no-trade and outside-offer values is 690.31 - 568.62 = 121.69. This is the most I can possibly give away.\n\nNow consider giving them nothing but item 5: I have 3 of item 5, which is worth 96 * 3 = 288 to me. If I only give them 1 unit of item 5, then I am left with value 288-96 = 192. The value of this outcome is 851 - 96 = 755 * 0.81 = 611.55\n\nThe difference in giving away one of item 5 compared to giving away all of it to make my outside offer: 611.55 - 568.62 = 42.93.\nBut if I give only one item 5 to Player 2 my value is 755 * 0.81 = 611.55.\nTo beat my offer the player two has to offer me over 568.62 value in items, which is pretty hard for them to do.\nIt is best to play it safe, and make an extremely generous offer where they get almost everything.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 5, 1, 2]}\n",

Since it's round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so there's no discounting yet.\n\nMy values per item are: item 1: 46, item 2: 80, item 3: 30, item 4: 73, item 5: 9.\n\nI have 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 6 of item 5.\n\nA good starting point is to offer Player 2 a split that's relatively even in terms of total value, but slightly biased towards giving them more of the items I value less. This will encourage them to accept without giving away too much of my valuable items.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 the following:\n* Item 1: 1 unit (value to me: 46)\n* Item 2: 2 units (value to me: 160)\n* Item 3: 1 unit (value to me: 30)\n* Item 4: 1 unit (value to me: 73)\n* Item 5: 3 units (value to me: 27)\n\nThis leaves me with:\n* Item 1: 2 units (value to me: 92)\n* Item 2: 2 units (value to me: 160)\n* Item 3: 2 units (value to me: 60)\n* Item 4: 2 units (value to me: 146)\n* Item 5: 3 units (value to me: 27)\n\nMy total value would be 92 + 160 + 60 + 146 + 27 = 485.

Since this is round 1, and there's no offer on the table, I need to make the first offer. I need to consider what Player 2 might value the items at, but without any information, I'll start with a somewhat fair division, leaning slightly in my favor, and see how Player 2 reacts. A naive split would be:\n\nItem 1: Player 2 gets 0.5 (since there's 1 unit).\nItem 2: Player 2 gets 2 (since there's 4 units).\nItem 3: Player 2 gets 2 (since there's 4 units).\nItem 4: Player 2 gets 2 (since there's 4 units).\nItem 5: Player 2 gets 2.5 (since there's 5 units).\n\nThis results in the offer [0.5, 2, 2, 2, 2.5] to Player 2.\n\nMy resulting items would then be:\nItem 1: 0.5\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2.5\n\nMy value would be:\n0.  5 * 87 + 2 * 92 + 2 * 76 + 2 * 30 + 2.5 * 76 = 43.5 + 184 + 152 + 60 + 190 = 629.5\n\nThis value (629.5) is higher than my outside offer (428).\n\nNow, to be a bit more strategic. Since it is round 1, I can offer something slightly worse for me to test the waters. Let's offer:\nItem 1: 0.6\nItem 2: 2.1\nItem 3: 2.1\nItem 4: 2.1\nItem 5: 2.6\n\nSo I keep\nItem 1: 0.4\nItem 2: 1.9\nItem 3: 1.9\nItem 4: 1.9\nItem 5: 2.4\n\nMy value would be:\n0.  4 * 87 + 1.9 * 92 + 1.9 * 76 + 1.9 * 30 + 2.4 * 76 = 34.8 + 174.8 + 144.4 + 57 + 182.4 = 593.4\n\nThis is still better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try to push it a little further. Offer:\nItem 1: 0.7\nItem 2: 2.2\nItem 3: 2.2\nItem 4: 2.2\nItem 5: 2.7\n\nSo I keep\nItem 1: 0.3\nItem 2: 1.8\nItem 3: 1.8\nItem 4: 1.8\nItem 5: 2.3\n\nMy value is:\n0.  3 * 87 + 1.8 * 92 + 1.8 * 76 + 1.8 * 30 + 2.3 * 76 = 26.1 + 165.6 + 136.8 + 54 + 174.8 = 557.3\n\nStill higher than 428.\n\nLet's try offering player 2 a bit more of item 2 since that is what I value highly. Let's try:\nItem 1: 0.5\nItem 2: 2.3\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2.5\n\nSo I keep\nItem 1: 0.5\nItem 2: 1.7\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2.5\n\nMy value is:\n0.  5 * 87 + 1.7 * 92 + 2 * 76 + 2 * 30 + 2.5 * 76 = 43.5 + 156.4 + 152 + 60 + 190 = 601.9\n\nOkay, I'll offer the following:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0.5, 2.2, 2, 2, 2.5]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 2 is offering me [0, 2, 2, 2, 3] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. I need to decide whether to accept this offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n* Item 1: 0 * 87 = 0\n* Item 2: 2 * 92 = 184\n* Item 3: 2 * 76 = 152\n* Item 4: 2 * 30 = 60\n* Item 5: 3 * 76 = 228\nTotal value of the offer: 0 + 184 + 152 + 60 + 228 = 624\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Therefore, the present value of accepting this offer is 624 * 0.9 = 561.6.\n\nMy outside offer is 428. Since 561.6 > 428, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *right now*. However, this is a negotiation, and it's round 2. Perhaps I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nTo decide on a counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 2 might accept. Let's analyze Player 2's offer: [0, 2, 2, 2, 3]. This means I would keep:\n* Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1\n* Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2\n* Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2\n* Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n* Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I get most of item 2 since it has the highest value for me. How about I offer [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2. Then I would keep [1, 3, 3, 3, 4]. The value of this to me is:\n* 1 * 87 = 87\n* 3 * 92 = 276\n* 3 * 76 = 228\n* 3 * 30 = 90\n* 4 * 76 = 304\nTotal value: 87 + 276 + 228 + 90 + 304 = 985\nWith discount factor, this would be 985 * 0.9 = 886.5. Since I am quite confident in this negotiation so far, I think I should attempt to get closer to my ideal outcome.\n\nHere's another option, I offer [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] to Player 2.\nThen I would keep [1, 3, 3, 3, 5]. The value of this to me is:\n* 1 * 87 = 87\n* 3 * 92 = 276\n* 3 * 76 = 228\n* 3 * 30 = 90\n* 5 * 76 = 380\nTotal value: 87 + 276 + 228 + 90 + 380 = 1061\nWith discount factor, this would be 1061 * 0.9 = 954.9.\n\nIt looks like the higher the amount of units I offer, the lower my total value will be. I still have room to negotiate.\n\nOkay, let's go with offering [0, 1, 1, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by considering my options and their potential outcomes.\n\n**Understanding the Situation**\n\n*   **My Values:** Item 1: 20, Item 2: 34, Item 3: 46, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 32\n*   **Item Quantities:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 8\n*   **My Outside Offer:** 279\n*   **Discount Factor:** 0.9\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nSince there's no offer on the table, I need to make the first move. I have two options: WALK or make an offer. Walking away guarantees me 279.\n\nTo determine if making an offer is better, I need to consider what Player 2 might accept and what I would get in return. I don't know Player 2's values, so I need to make some assumptions. A simple starting point is to aim for an equal split of the total value. My total value for all items is:\n\n(6 * 20) + (2 * 34) + (2 * 46) + (3 * 5) + (8 * 32) = 120 + 68 + 92 + 15 + 256 = 551\n\nA perfectly even split would give me 551 / 2 = 275.5. Since my outside offer is 279, I need to get slightly *more* than half the value to make it worthwhile *before* considering the discount factor. Therefore, I want an offer that will give me at least 279 / 0.9 = 310 *after* discount factor.\n\nTo start, I'll propose a counteroffer that I believe is slightly in my favor but still reasonable enough for Player 2 to consider, hoping to avoid an immediate walk. I'll aim to give the other player slightly less than half of each item, starting with a proposal to give the following to player 2:\nitem 1: 3\nitem 2: 1\nitem 3: 1\nitem 4: 1\nitem 5: 4\n\nThis leaves me with:\nitem 1: 3, value 60\nitem 2: 1, value 34\nitem 3: 1, value 46\nitem 4: 2, value 10\nitem 5: 4, value 128\nTotal value to me: 60 + 34 + 46 + 10 + 128 = 278\n\nHowever, this offer isn't good enough! Let's try a better offer and give more to player 2:\nitem 1: 2\nitem 2: 0\nitem 3: 0\nitem 4: 1\nitem 5: 3\nThis leaves me with:\nitem 1: 4, value 80\nitem 2: 2, value 68\nitem 3: 2, value 92\nitem 4: 2, value 10\nitem 5: 5, value 160\nTotal value: 80 + 68 + 92 + 10 + 160 = 410. This is clearly better than my outside option!\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 1, 3]}\n```",

The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n* 3 units of item 1: 3 * 20 = 60\n* 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 34 = 34\n* 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 46 = 46\n* 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 5 = 5\n* 4 units of item 5: 4 * 32 = 128\nTotal value of current offer: 60 + 34 + 46 + 5 + 128 = 273\n\nNow, let's consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the value of the current offer is 273 * 0.9^(2-1) = 273 * 0.9 = 245.7\n\nSince 245.7 is less than my outside offer of 279, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer.  I want to get at least 279 / 0.9 = 310 worth of items for myself in the final round. This is what I would need for acceptance by the other player to improve on walking away.\nHere's what I currently have:\nItem 1: 6 units total, giving 3 to player 2 and taking 3.\nItem 2: 2 units total, giving 1 to player 2 and taking 1.\nItem 3: 2 units total, giving 1 to player 2 and taking 1.\nItem 4: 3 units total, giving 1 to player 2 and taking 1.\nItem 5: 8 units total, giving 4 to player 2 and taking 4.\n\nLet's try to construct a deal. Can I make a reasonable counteroffer to get more value?

The current offer on the table is [0, 2, 0, 1, 0], meaning I get 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are:\n- Item 1: 36\n- Item 2: 66\n- Item 3: 27\n- Item 4: 90\n- Item 5: 94\n\nThe value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 36) + (2 * 66) + (0 * 27) + (1 * 90) + (0 * 94) = 0 + 132 + 0 + 90 + 0 = 222.\n\nMy outside offer is 589. Since 222 is less than 589, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since this is the last round, any counteroffer from Player 2 will be treated as a WALK. Therefore, if I make a counteroffer, I need to ensure that Player 2 will accept it. I need to give Player 2 enough to make them prefer my offer over their outside offer.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 2 everything. This would mean I get nothing.\nMy value would be 0. This is obviously worse than my outside offer of 589.\n\nLet's try to give Player 2 something that might make them accept. I have:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 7 units of item 5\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 2 all of items 2, 3, and 5, and keep item 4 for myself. The offer would be [0, 2, 2, 0, 7].\nMy value would be (1 * 90) = 90. Again, this is worse than my outside offer of 589.\n\nSince any reasonable counteroffer would likely be rejected by Player 2 and leave me with a lower value than my outside offer, I should WALK away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since it's the first round and there's no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer to Player 2.\n\nMy private values are:\nItem 1: 29 (5 units)\nItem 2: 49 (3 units)\nItem 3: 67 (0 units)\nItem 4: 26 (5 units)\nItem 5: 85 (4 units)\n\nMy total value of all items is 762.\n\nI want to make an offer that is attractive enough for Player 2 to accept, but also leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer of 548. A good starting point is to aim for an equal split in terms of value, although I know Player 2's values are different.\n\nI will start by giving Player 2 slightly more than half of each item, and adjust a little based on my high valuation of Item 5. I will offer them 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\nValue of offer to Player 2 from my perspective:\n3 * 29 + 2 * 49 + 0 * 67 + 3 * 26 + 2 * 85 = 87 + 98 + 0 + 78 + 170 = 433\n\nWhat I keep:\n2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5\n\nValue of what I keep:\n2 * 29 + 1 * 49 + 0 * 67 + 2 * 26 + 2 * 85 = 58 + 49 + 0 + 52 + 170 = 329\n\nThis is not enough, so I need to reduce my offer to player 2 to ensure I have value greater than my outside option.\nI will offer 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n\nValue of offer to Player 2 from my perspective:\n2 * 29 + 1 * 49 + 0 * 67 + 2 * 26 + 1 * 85 = 58 + 49 + 0 + 52 + 85 = 244\n\nWhat I keep:\n3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n\nValue of what I keep:\n3 * 29 + 2 * 49 + 0 * 67 + 3 * 26 + 3 * 85 = 87 + 98 + 0 + 78 + 255 = 518\n\nThis is still less than 548.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, it's round 3, and I need to make a decision. The current offer on the table gives me [2, 1, 0, 2, 1] units of each item. Let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units * 29 = 58\n*   Item 2: 1 unit * 49 = 49\n*   Item 3: 0 units * 67 = 0\n*   Item 4: 2 units * 26 = 52\n*   Item 5: 1 unit * 85 = 85\n\nTotal value of current offer: 58 + 49 + 0 + 52 + 85 = 244\n\nSince this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\nTherefore, the present value of the current offer is 244 * 0.81 = 197.64.\n\nMy outside offer is 548. Since 197.64 is significantly lower than 548, accepting the offer is not a good idea.\n\nNow, let's consider a possible counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while making it attractive enough for Player 2 to accept. Since it's the last round, Player 2 will walk if they don't like my offer. Let's try to give Player 2 just enough to make them accept, by giving player 2 a distribution slightly above the current offers on the table, while keeping the bulk of the valuable items for myself.\n\nI have a total of 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. The current offer to player 2 represents [5-2, 3-1, 0-0, 5-2, 4-1] = [3, 2, 0, 3, 3] for myself. To make this attractive to Player 2, I will give player 2 what they asked for in round 1 which is: [2, 1, 0, 2, 2]. This leaves me with [3,2,0,3,2].\n\nThe value of the [3,2,0,3,2] offer is to me: 3*29 + 2*49 + 0*67 + 3*26 + 2*85 = 87+98+0+78+170 = 433\nThe discounted value of [3,2,0,3,2] offer is to me: 433 * 0.81 = 350.73. This is less than my outside offer value.\n\nThe value of the offer to player 2 is [2,1,0,2,2].\nThe value of this offer to me is: 2*29 + 1*49 + 0*67 + 2*26 + 2*85 = 58+49+0+52+170 = 329.\nThe discounted value of this offer to me is: 329*0.81=266.49. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet me make the most aggressive counteroffer I can make, to attempt to beat my outside offer in this final round. I will keep as much of the most valuable item (item 5) as possible for myself, while ensuring Player 2 receives at least 1 item.\n\nI will counteroffer the following to Player 2 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I will be getting [4, 3, 0, 5, 3]. My value calculation is:\nItem 1: 4 * 29 = 116\nItem 2: 3 * 49 = 147\nItem 3: 0 * 67 = 0\nItem 4: 5 * 26 = 130\nItem 5: 3 * 85 = 255\nTotal Value: 116 + 147 + 0 + 130 + 255 = 648\nDiscounted Total Value: 648 * 0.81 = 524.88. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, and even an aggressive counteroffer doesn't beat my outside offer value after the discount, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

My values are 52, 32, 45, 99, and 7, respectively. My outside offer is 849.\n\nMy total value for all items is (3 * 52) + (0 * 32) + (7 * 45) + (6 * 99) + (7 * 7) = 156 + 0 + 315 + 594 + 49 = 1114.\n\nSince it's the first round, I want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted, but still gives me a good value. I need to offer Player 2 enough to make them prefer my offer over their (unknown) outside offer. It's difficult to assess their valuation but I have to start somewhere.\n\nA reasonable starting point might be to offer Player 2 roughly half the total value. However, I should be mindful of my outside option. I'll start by offering Player 2 an amount that gives me a value close to my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering the other player 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5.\nValue to player 2 = (1*52 + 3*45 + 3*99 + 3*7) = (52 + 135 + 297 + 21) = 505. This seems like a potentially attractive offer.\nNow let's calculate what this leaves me with. I will have 2 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\nMy value = 2*52 + 0*32 + 4*45 + 3*99 + 4*7 = 104 + 0 + 180 + 297 + 28 = 609.\nThis value is lower than my outside offer of 849.\n\nLet's try offering player 2 a little less. Try 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\nValue to player 2 = 1*52 + 2*45 + 2*99 + 2*7 = 52 + 90 + 198 + 14 = 354.\nMy value = 2*52 + 0*32 + 5*45 + 4*99 + 5*7 = 104 + 0 + 225 + 396 + 35 = 760. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try an offer that gives me a little more, but doesn't give the other player too much.\nOffer player 2: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\nValue to player 2: 1*45 + 1*99 + 1*7 = 45 + 99 + 7 = 151\nMy Value: 3*52 + 0*32 + 6*45 + 5*99 + 6*7 = 156 + 0 + 270 + 495 + 42 = 963\nThis offer is pretty good for me.\n\nI think I'll make this the offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",
