By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 6, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 2 + 90 x 5 + 28 x 6 + 44 x 2 + 61 x 5\n    which is 1029 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1031. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 5, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 5, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 1031.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 9, item 2 = 90, item 3 = 28, item 4 = 44, item 5 = 61.\n*   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value. This gives me an incentive to accept a reasonable offer sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 5, 2, 3]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   5 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n\n    The value of this offer to me is: (1 * 9) + (2 * 90) + (5 * 28) + (2 * 44) + (3 * 61) = 9 + 180 + 140 + 88 + 183 = 600.\n    Since 600 < 1031, accepting this offer would be worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1031. Let's consider keeping most of the high-value items and offering the rest to Player 1. For example, I could try keeping [4, 5, 8, 2, 5] items for myself and offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1 (this is not an acceptable offer, but shows the calculation for my item values):\n\n    *   Value = (4 * 9) + (5 * 90) + (8 * 28) + (2 * 44) + (5 * 61) = 36 + 450 + 224 + 88 + 305 = 1103. This is my maximum possible value, since I am keeping all the items.\n\n    I need to find a counteroffer that is more appealing to Player 1, while still being better than my outside offer. Let's try a counteroffer of [0, 1, 3, 0, 0], meaning I keep [4, 4, 5, 2, 5].\n\n    *   Value = (4 * 9) + (4 * 90) + (5 * 28) + (2 * 44) + (5 * 61) = 36 + 360 + 140 + 88 + 305 = 929\n\n    This is not good enough as 929 < 1031.\n\n    Let's try offering [1, 0, 5, 0, 0], so I keep [3, 5, 3, 2, 5].\n\n    * Value = (3 * 9) + (5 * 90) + (3 * 28) + (2 * 44) + (5 * 61) = 27 + 450 + 84 + 88 + 305 = 954.\n\n    This is still not good enough.\n\n    Let's try offering [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], so I keep [4, 5, 3, 2, 5]\n    * Value = (4 * 9) + (5 * 90) + (3 * 28) + (2 * 44) + (5 * 61) = 36 + 450 + 84 + 88 + 305 = 963. Still not good enough.\n\n    It is clear that I need to keep almost all the items if I want to achieve a value > 1031. Let's offer [1, 1, 4, 1, 1], so I keep [3, 4, 4, 1, 4].\n\n    * Value = (3 * 9) + (4 * 90) + (4 * 28) + (1 * 44) + (4 * 61) = 27 + 360 + 112 + 44 + 244 = 787. Still not good enough!\n\n    Let's offer [1, 0, 3, 0, 1], keeping [3, 5, 5, 2, 4]:\n\n    * Value = 27 + 450 + 140 + 88 + 244 = 949.\n\n    Let's offer [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], so I keep [4, 4, 8, 1, 5].\n\n    * Value = 36 + 360 + 224 + 44 + 305 = 969.\n\n    Let's offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], so I keep [4, 5, 8, 1, 5].\n\n    * Value = 36 + 450 + 224 + 44 + 305 = 1059.\n\n    This offer is good enough.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 600, which is less than my outside offer of 1031.\n*   I can propose a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] which gives me 1059.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 0 + 18 x 1 + 45 x 1 + 58 x 6 + 76 x 1\n    which is 487 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 490. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 6, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 6, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   **My Outside Offer Value:** 490\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 71, Item 2: 18, Item 3: 45, Item 4: 58, Item 5: 76\n*   **Total Items:** 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 2, 0, 6, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 71 = 142\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 18 = 36\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 45 = 45\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 58 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 76 = 76\n    *   Total Value: 142 + 36 + 45 + 0 + 76 = 299\n\n    *   Since 299 < 490 (my outside offer), accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to formulate a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 490. Let's try offering Player 1 only 1 unit of item 4, giving them the offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]:\n    * I keep: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n    * My Value: (2 * 71) + (4 * 18) + (1 * 45) + (5 * 58) + (1 * 76) = 142 + 72 + 45 + 290 + 76 = 625\n    *   Since 625 > 490, this is a better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   I can make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n*   Therefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\nSo, let's make the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

This means I keep [5-2, 2-1, 4-0, 6-6, 7-4] = [3, 1, 4, 0, 3].\n    My value for this offer is (3 * 3) + (64 * 1) + (68 * 4) + (92 * 0) + (13 * 3) = 9 + 64 + 272 + 0 + 39 = 384.  Since 384 < 973, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n    - **Potential counteroffers:**\n        Let's start by calculating the total value of all items to me:\n        (5 * 3) + (2 * 64) + (4 * 68) + (6 * 92) + (7 * 13) = 15 + 128 + 272 + 552 + 91 = 1058\n\n        I want to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 973. This means Player 1's value should be lower than 1058 - 973 = 85. \n        If I offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and take everything myself, I get 1058 which is > 973. But this will probably be rejected.\n        Let's try to find a reasonable offer to start with.

The value is 3*3+2*64+3*68+0*92+0*13 = 9+128+204+0+0 = 341.\n\n        I need to keep most of items 3 and 4.\n        If I offer player 1 [5, 2, 4, 0, 7], I keep [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]. The value is 6*92 = 552\n        If I offer player 1 [5, 2, 0, 0, 7], I keep [0, 0, 4, 6, 0]. The value is 4*68+6*92 = 272+552 = 824.\n\n        Let's offer player 1 only small numbers of items 1, 2, 3, and 5, and keep all the item 4.\n\n        If I offer [3, 1, 2, 0, 4], I keep [2, 1, 2, 6, 3]. Value = 2*3+1*64+2*68+6*92+3*13 = 6+64+136+552+39 = 797\n        \n        If I offer [2, 0, 1, 0, 3], I keep [3, 2, 3, 6, 4]. Value = 3*3+2*64+3*68+6*92+4*13 = 9+128+204+552+52 = 945. \n        \n        If I offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 2], I keep [4, 2, 4, 6, 5]. Value = 4*3+2*64+4*68+6*92+5*13 = 12+128+272+552+65 = 1029\n\n        This gives me the value higher than my outside offer!\n        \n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    Since the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it. I should also not walk away yet, since it's only round 1 and I can try to get a better deal. The offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 2] gives me the value of 1029, which is higher than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 4, 6, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 973\n*   Item values: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 64, item 3 = 68, item 4 = 92, item 5 = 13\n*   Total items: 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to both players.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 6, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   0 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   6 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n\n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 3) + (0 * 64) + (0 * 68) + (6 * 92) + (2 * 13) = 3 + 0 + 0 + 552 + 26 = 581\n\n    Since 581 < 973, accepting this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a division that is worth more than 973 to me. Let's start by considering a possible counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, and item 4 has the highest value per unit (92). Let's consider offering player 1 only item 1 and item 5.\n\n    *   Offer: [5, 2, 4, 0, 7] : I get [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]. My value is (0 * 3) + (0 * 64) + (0 * 68) + (6 * 92) + (0 * 13) = 552\n    *   Offer: [4, 2, 4, 0, 7] : I get [1, 0, 0, 6, 0]. My value is (1 * 3) + (0 * 64) + (0 * 68) + (6 * 92) + (0 * 13) = 555\n    *   Offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] : I get [5, 2, 4, 6, 7]. My value is (5 * 3) + (2 * 64) + (4 * 68) + (6 * 92) + (7 * 13) = 15 + 128 + 272 + 552 + 91 = 1058\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 581, which is much less than my outside offer of 973. I should not accept.\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that is worth more than 973 to me.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that is close to my outside offer, but still gives Player 1 some items.\n\n*   Counteroffer: [2, 1, 0, 6, 4] (This is what player 1 offered in the first round) My value is (3*3) + (1*64) + (4*68) + (0*92) + (3*13) = 9+64+272+0+39 = 384.\n*   Counteroffer: [1, 0, 0, 0, 2] (This is what I offered in the first round). My value is (4*3) + (2*64) + (4*68) + (6*92) + (5*13) = 12 + 128 + 272 + 552 + 65 = 1029.\n\nSince I can't accept the current offer (581 < 973), and a few counteroffers are worse than my outside offer, but the first round counteroffer is good (1029 > 973), let's resend my offer from round 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 1, 8, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 2 + 95 x 4 + 43 x 1 + 70 x 8 + 47 x 1\n    which is 1170 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1171. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1171\n*   **My values of the items:** Item 1: 70, Item 2: 95, Item 3: 43, Item 4: 70, Item 5: 47\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 8, Item 5: 1\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 5, 0, 2, 1]. This means they are offering me:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   5 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n\n    My value if I accept this offer:\n    (1 * 70) + (5 * 95) + (0 * 43) + (2 * 70) + (1 * 47) = 70 + 475 + 0 + 140 + 47 = 732\n\n    Since 732 < 1171, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to determine what I can offer Player 1 that will give me a value greater than 1171.\n    Let's consider keeping the following amounts of each item:\n    Item 1: 4\n    Item 2: 0\n    Item 3: 3\n    Item 4: 8\n    Item 5: 0\n    Total value = 4*70 + 0*95 + 3*43 + 8*70 + 0*47 = 280 + 0 + 129 + 560 + 0 = 969\n    This isn't enough.\n\n    Let's try keeping:\n    Item 1: 4\n    Item 2: 1\n    Item 3: 3\n    Item 4: 8\n    Item 5: 1\n    Total value = 4*70 + 1*95 + 3*43 + 8*70 + 1*47 = 280 + 95 + 129 + 560 + 47 = 1111\n    Still less than 1171\n\n    Let's try keeping:\n    Item 1: 4\n    Item 2: 2\n    Item 3: 3\n    Item 4: 8\n    Item 5: 1\n    Total value = 4*70 + 2*95 + 3*43 + 8*70 + 1*47 = 280 + 190 + 129 + 560 + 47 = 1206\n    This is greater than 1171. So I want to keep at least this.\n\n    If I keep [4, 2, 3, 8, 1], that means I offer [0, 3, 0, 0, 0].\n    Player 1 offered me [1, 5, 0, 2, 1]. I don't want to accept that.\n\n    I want to make a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside offer, but also hopefully acceptable to Player 1. Let's try offering a minimal amount that still leaves me with more than 1171.\n\n    If I offer [0, 3, 0, 0, 0], I keep [4, 2, 3, 8, 1], which is worth 1206.\n    Let's offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] to player 1.\n    This means I keep [4, 3, 3, 8, 1], which is worth 4*70 + 3*95 + 3*43 + 8*70 + 1*47 = 280 + 285 + 129 + 560 + 47 = 1301\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it. I also want to avoid walking away, if possible, as this guarantees me my outside offer but does not explore the possibility of a better outcome. I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 83 x 2 + 3 x 1 + 84 x 0 + 36 x 1\n    which is 205 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 206. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 0 + 91 x 1 + 78 x 0 + 79 x 1 + 50 x 0\n    which is 170 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 174. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [7, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [7, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 174\n*   My values for the items: item 1: 68, item 2: 91, item 3: 78, item 4: 79, item 5: 50\n*   Total pool of items: item 1: 7, item 2: 2, item 3: 4, item 4: 3, item 5: 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [7, 0, 0, 0, 1].  This means Player 1 keeps 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. The value to me is: (7 * 68) + (0 * 91) + (0 * 78) + (0 * 79) + (1 * 50) = 476 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 = 526.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 526, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 174.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since I have an offer much better than my outside option I should consider what I might gain from a counteroffer.\n    *   If I accepted Player 1's offer I would get a value of 526.\n    *   The total value of all items is (7 * 68) + (2 * 91) + (4 * 78) + (3 * 79) + (5 * 50) = 476 + 182 + 312 + 237 + 250 = 1457. I want to get as close to this as possible, while also ensuring Player 1 gets enough that they don't walk away.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. It seems Player 1 values item 1 and 5. Let me give them all of those and keep the rest.\nCounteroffer to Player 1: [0, 2, 4, 3, 4]. This means I keep: [7, 0, 0, 0, 1]. The value of that to me is:\n(7 * 68) + (0 * 91) + (0 * 78) + (0 * 79) + (1 * 50) = 476 + 50 = 526. This is the value I would get if I accepted so there is no benefit to this.\n\nLet's try to take a bit more. Give them [6, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This would leave me with [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]. My value would be:\n(1 * 68) + (2 * 91) + (4 * 78) + (3 * 79) + (5 * 50) = 68 + 182 + 312 + 237 + 250 = 1049.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [7, 0, 0, 0, 1] is worth 526 to me, which is much better than my outside option of 174. I can accept the offer as is.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 761. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 2, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 2 + 87 x 3 + 83 x 2 + 19 x 4 + 29 x 5\n    which is 760 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 761. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

What if I offered: Item 1: 1, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 3 (the current offer)?\nThen I keep: Item 1: 2, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 2\nValue: (2 * 56) + (2 * 87) + (2 * 83) + (2 * 19) + (2 * 29) = 112 + 174 + 166 + 38 + 58 = 548\nThis is still not enough!\n\nLet's aim for a value greater than 761.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 313. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 313. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 474 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 0 + 15 x 0 + 64 x 2 + 49 x 1 + 27 x 5\n    which is 312 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 313. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n    *   My outside offer value is 313.\n    *   My values for the items are: item 1 = 3, item 2 = 15, item 3 = 64, item 4 = 49, item 5 = 27.\n    *   The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n    *   The discount factor is 0.9.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n    *   **Current Offer:** I am being offered [2, 2, 1, 0, 3]. This means I would receive:\n        *   2 units of item 1\n        *   2 units of item 2\n        *   1 unit of item 3\n        *   0 units of item 4\n        *   3 units of item 5\n        *   The value of this offer to me is: (2 * 3) + (2 * 15) + (1 * 64) + (0 * 49) + (3 * 27) = 6 + 30 + 64 + 0 + 81 = 181\n        *   Since 181 < 313, accepting this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n    *   **Potential Counteroffers:** I want to find a division of items where my total value is greater than my outside offer of 313. I have the following items to distribute:\n        *   Item 1: 2 units\n        *   Item 2: 4 units\n        *   Item 3: 2 units\n        *   Item 4: 1 unit\n        *   Item 5: 5 units\n\n        I need to determine how many of each item I keep versus offer to Player 1 to maximize my value. Item 3 and Item 4 have high values for me, so I want to keep as many as possible.\n\n        Let's consider keeping all of items 3 and 4 (2 units of item 3 and 1 unit of item 4). That gives me a value of (2 * 64) + (1 * 49) = 128 + 49 = 177.  I need an additional 313 - 177 = 136 in value.\n\n        Consider keeping all of item 5 as well: (5 * 27) = 135. Adding this to the earlier value gives 177 + 135 = 312. I need a value of 1 more than my outside option.\n\t\n\tNow I consider how to improve this. Item 2 has a reasonable value of 15. Keeping one item 2 would give me 312+15 = 327 which is good.\n\n\tSo, keep all units of items 3, 4, 5 and one unit of item 2.\n\tOffer 2 units of item 1 and 3 units of item 2.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    *   The current offer is unacceptable.\n    *   I should not walk away yet, as there's still potential to negotiate a better deal.\n    *   I should propose a counteroffer that guarantees me a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n    I will make the following counteroffer: Give Player 1 2 units of item 1, and 3 units of item 2. This means I keep 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. The value of this counteroffer to me is: (0 * 3) + (1 * 15) + (2 * 64) + (1 * 49) + (5 * 27) = 0 + 15 + 128 + 49 + 135 = 327, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 7, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 5 + 96 x 7 + 58 x 0 + 90 x 0 + 59 x 2\n    which is 1260 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1264. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value to me.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n    *   Current offer: [4, 3, 1, 1, 3] (This is what Player 1 is offering *to me*).\n    *   This means I would get 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n    *   My value for this offer: (4 * 94) + (3 * 96) + (1 * 58) + (1 * 90) + (3 * 59) = 376 + 288 + 58 + 90 + 177 = 989\n    *   Since this is round 2, if I accept, the value is 989 * 0.9^(2-1) = 989 * 0.9 = 890.1\n    *   Comparing to outside offer: 890.1 is less than 1264, so accepting this offer *now* is worse than walking away *now*.\n\n3.  **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\n    I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. I need to keep enough items to achieve a value of at least 1264/0.9 = 1404.44\n\n    Let's consider keeping [5, 5, 1, 1, 3] for myself.

Then with the discount factor it is 1275 * 0.9 = 1147.5.\n\n    Let's consider keeping [5, 6, 2, 2, 4] for myself. Then my offer to player 1 is [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    My value for this would be (5 * 94) + (6 * 96) + (2 * 58) + (2 * 90) + (4 * 59) = 470 + 576 + 116 + 180 + 236 = 1578.  Then with the discount factor it is 1578 * 0.9 = 1420.2\n\n    Let's consider keeping [6, 7, 2, 2, 4] for myself.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 3 + 21 x 3 + 16 x 0 + 28 x 1 + 51 x 0\n    which is 367 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 368. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 368\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 92, Item 2: 21, Item 3: 16, Item 4: 28, Item 5: 51\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 1\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means offers in later rounds are worth less (e.g., an offer worth 400 in round 2 is actually worth 400 * 0.9 = 360).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 4, 0, 1, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit * 92 = 92\n    *   Item 2: 4 units * 21 = 84\n    *   Item 3: 0 units * 16 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit * 28 = 28\n    *   Item 5: 0 units * 51 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 92 + 84 + 0 + 28 + 0 = 204\n\n    *   Comparing the current offer (204) to my outside offer (368), the current offer is worse. Accepting would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 368.  To do that, I need to figure out what allocation of items would give me a value greater than 368. Let's start by giving player 1 the minimum of each item and see where that leaves me.\n\n    *   I keep: Item 1: 3, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 1\n    *   Value: (3 * 92) + (2 * 21) + (0 * 16) + (1 * 28) + (1 * 51) = 276 + 42 + 0 + 28 + 51 = 397\n    *   This already exceeds my outside offer value. So a possible counteroffer would be for Player 1 to receive [1, 4, 0, 1, 0] which leaves me with [3, 2, 0, 1, 1].\n\n    *   I could also try to keep more items for myself. Lets try for a more ambitious offer, giving the other player less.\n    *   I keep: Item 1: 4, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 0, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 1\n    *   Value: (4 * 92) + (6 * 21) + (0 * 16) + (2 * 28) + (1 * 51) = 368 + 126 + 0 + 56 + 51 = 601\n    *   This is my maximum possible value. I give [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n*   I can make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I will aim for as much as I can get.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer where Player 1 receives nothing.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 3 + 21 x 3 + 16 x 0 + 28 x 1 + 51 x 0\n    which is 367 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 368. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 6, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 368.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 92, item 2 = 21, item 3 = 16, item 4 = 28, item 5 = 51.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9.  Since it's round 2, the current discount is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** The current offer is [0, 6, 0, 2, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. If I accept, my value would be:\n     (0 * 92) + (6 * 21) + (0 * 16) + (2 * 28) + (0 * 51) = 0 + 126 + 0 + 56 + 0 = 182.\n     Since it is round 2, the discounted value is 182 * 0.9 = 163.8.\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 163.8 < 368. Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 368 / 0.9 = 408.89. This is the value I need to achieve *before* discounting in order to beat my outside offer after discounting. Let's try keeping all of item 1 and item 5, and some of the other items.\n\n   - **Counteroffer Example 1:** I keep 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.  This means my offer to Player 1 would be [0, 6, 0, 2, 0]. My value would be:\n      (4 * 92) + (0 * 21) + (0 * 16) + (0 * 28) + (1 * 51) = 368 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 51 = 419.\n      Since 419 > 408.89, this is a good starting point. It also avoids mistakes 1, 2, 3, and assuming Player 1 accepted, 4 and 5.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away guarantees me 368.\n   - A counteroffer like [0, 6, 0, 2, 0] (keeping all item 1 and item 5 and offering the rest) gives me 419, which is better than 408.89 (discounted outside offer).\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [0, 6, 0, 2, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 6, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 2 + 13 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 64 x 3 + 81 x 3\n    which is 511 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 512. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   **My Outside Offer Value:** 512\n*   **My Item Values:** Item 1: 38, Item 2: 13, Item 3: 96, Item 4: 64, Item 5: 81\n*   **Total Items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount Factor:** Gamma = 0.9. This means that deals in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 0 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 units\n\n    My value for this offer: (1 * 38) + (0 * 13) + (0 * 96) + (3 * 64) + (0 * 81) = 38 + 0 + 0 + 192 + 0 = 230\n\n    This value (230) is much lower than my outside offer (512).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 512. Let's consider an example. I propose a counteroffer that gives player 1 the following: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n    * Item 1: 3 units\n    * Item 2: 3 units\n    * Item 3: 3 units\n    * Item 4: 3 units\n    * Item 5: 3 units\nMy value would then be: (3 * 38) + (3 * 13) + (3 * 96) + (3 * 64) + (3 * 81) = 114 + 39 + 288 + 192 + 243 = 876\n\nThis is much greater than my outside offer. I need to propose an offer which provides value to both players.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is very bad for me, as 230 << 512.\n*   I should not accept the current offer.\n*   I could walk away, but it is round 1 and I would get my outside offer of 512.\n*   I should propose a counteroffer. Since the other player is undervaluing item 3, 4 and 5, I can give them 2 unit of item 1 to sweeten the deal and keep most of item 3, 4, and 5.\nCounteroffer: [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nThis will give me:\nItem 1: 3 * 38 = 114\nItem 2: 3 * 13 = 39\nItem 3: 3 * 96 = 288\nItem 4: 2 * 64 = 128\nItem 5: 3 * 81 = 243\nTotal Value = 812, which is greater than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1320. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 714 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [10, 3, 2, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 10 + 65 x 3 + 35 x 2 + 49 x 5 + 9 x 1\n    which is 1319 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1320. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 5, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 5, 6]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 1320\n   - Item values: Item 1 = 80, Item 2 = 65, Item 3 = 35, Item 4 = 49, Item 5 = 9\n   - Total item pool: 10 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in later rounds is worth less than a deal made now.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 1, 0, 5, 6]. This means I receive:\n      - 0 units of item 1\n      - 1 unit of item 2\n      - 0 units of item 3\n      - 5 units of item 4\n      - 6 units of item 5\n   - My value from accepting the current offer: (0 * 80) + (1 * 65) + (0 * 35) + (5 * 49) + (6 * 9) = 0 + 65 + 0 + 245 + 54 = 364.\n   - Compare to my outside offer: 364 < 1320. Accepting the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - Consider a potential counteroffer. I need to figure out what I want and what I can offer player 1 while still getting more than my outside offer.\n   - Total value of all items to me: (10 * 80) + (4 * 65) + (2 * 35) + (5 * 49) + (6 * 9) = 800 + 260 + 70 + 245 + 54 = 1429\n\n   - Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 a minimal amount of the items that I value highly and more of the items I value less. For example, I give them: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I keep everything and my value is 1429, which is greater than my outside offer of 1320.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer (value 364) is much worse than my outside offer (1320). So, I should not accept.\n   - Walking away gives me 1320.\n   - Making a counteroffer: I want to maximize my value, but also make the offer attractive to Player 1.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer: giving Player 1 [4, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThis means I keep [6, 4, 2, 5, 6]\nMy value is 6*80 + 4*65 + 2*35 + 5*49 + 6*9 = 480 + 260 + 70 + 245 + 54 = 1109 which is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try giving Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 5].\nThis means I keep [10, 4, 2, 5, 1].\nMy value is 10*80 + 4*65 + 2*35 + 5*49 + 1*9 = 800 + 260 + 70 + 245 + 9 = 1384.

Let me propose a counteroffer.\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer where I keep everything and give nothing to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 1 + 8 x 1 + 27 x 5 + 100 x 6 + 75 x 1\n    which is 899 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 900. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me, and accepting in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [4, 1, 0, 1, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   4 units of item 1 * 81 = 324\n    *   1 unit of item 2 * 8 = 8\n    *   0 units of item 3 * 27 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 4 * 100 = 100\n    *   1 unit of item 5 * 75 = 75\n    *   Total value = 324 + 8 + 0 + 100 + 75 = 507\n\n    This offer's discounted value in round 2 is 507 * 0.9 = 456.3. This is much lower than my outside offer of 900, so I should not accept it.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I want to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 900 / 0.9 = 1000 in undiscounted value.  Let's see what it would take to get to at least that.\n\n    *   I have a total value of 1196. To get a discounted value of more than 900, I must secure more than 1000.

That means I keep:\n        *   4 units of item 1 * 81 = 324\n        *   0 units of item 2 * 8 = 0\n        *   2 units of item 3 * 27 = 54\n        *   6 units of item 4 * 100 = 600\n        *   0 units of item 5 * 75 = 0\n        *   Total value = 324 + 0 + 54 + 600 + 0 = 978\n         Still not good enough.\n     *   Now I will try to improve the value.\n        Let's try offering [0, 1, 4, 0, 1] to Player 1. That means I keep:\n        *   4 units of item 1 * 81 = 324\n        *   0 units of item 2 * 8 = 0\n        *   3 units of item 3 * 27 = 81\n        *   6 units of item 4 * 100 = 600\n        *   0 units of item 5 * 75 = 0\n        *   Total value = 324 + 0 + 81 + 600 + 0 = 1005.\n         This is just above 1000.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is bad.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 80. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1104 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 99 x 0 + 57 x 1 + 80 x 0\n    which is 57 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 80. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 170. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 555 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 90 x 0 + 28 x 5 + 4 x 1 + 5 x 5\n    which is 169 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 170. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 8]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 8]\n\n    What is your action?

This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 0, 1, 0, 8]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 8 units of item 5.\n      - My value if I accept: (0 * 58) + (0 * 90) + (1 * 28) + (0 * 4) + (8 * 5) = 28 + 40 = 68.\n\n      - Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 68 * 0.9^(2-1) = 68 * 0.9 = 61.2. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 170.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to consider counteroffers that give me a value greater than 170.\n\nLet's consider keeping all items:\nValue = (0 * 58) + (4 * 90) + (5 * 28) + (5 * 4) + (8 * 5) = 0 + 360 + 140 + 20 + 40 = 560\nThis is the total value of all the items if I keep them all.\n\nSince I am currently getting an offer worth 61.2, I will attempt to negotiate for something better than my outside option (170), since it is still early in the negotiation and I may receive an offer worth much more than my outside offer, if I try to negotiate.\nI can try to propose an even split.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 816. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 3, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 0 + 96 x 5 + 33 x 3 + 32 x 3 + 70 x 2\n    which is 815 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 816. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 6, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an agreement in later rounds is worth less to me. Specifically, an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the nominal value, and an agreement in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the nominal value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [4, 6, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. The value of this offer to me is:\n    (4 * 35) + (6 * 96) + (0 * 33) + (0 * 32) + (0 * 70) = 140 + 576 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 716.\n\n*   Since 716 < 816 (my outside offer), accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 816. Let's consider keeping all of items 2, 3, 4, and 5, and giving all of item 1 to Player 1. This means I would be offering [4, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1, and keeping [0, 6, 5, 3, 3] for myself. The value to me is:\n    (0 * 35) + (6 * 96) + (5 * 33) + (3 * 32) + (3 * 70) = 0 + 576 + 165 + 96 + 210 = 1047.\n\n*   This counteroffer gives me a value of 1047, which is greater than my outside offer of 816.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable because it's worth less than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away guarantees me 816.\n*   A counteroffer of [4, 0, 0, 0, 0] would give me a value of 1047.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [3, 6, 0, 3, 2].  This means I would get:\n        *   Item 1: 3 units * 35 = 105\n        *   Item 2: 6 units * 96 = 576\n        *   Item 3: 0 units * 33 = 0\n        *   Item 4: 3 units * 32 = 96\n        *   Item 5: 2 units * 70 = 140\n        *   Total value = 105 + 576 + 0 + 96 + 140 = 917\n\n        Since 917 > 816, accepting the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider if there's a better counteroffer I could make, taking into account the discount factor.  Since it's round 2, and accepting nets me 917, I need to get a value of at least 917/0.9 = 1018.89 in round 3 to make it worthwhile.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer is worth 917, which is greater than my outside offer of 816.  Therefore, I should accept the current offer.\n    *   Alternatively, consider counteroffers. If I counteroffer, it must be better than 816/0.9 = 906.67. This is the minimum I can offer myself, to make it worthwhile for Player 1 to accept the counteroffer. The maximum is 1187. Player 1 will only accept the offer if they are getting more than their value. If I accept, the calculation is 3 * 35 + 6 * 96 + 0 * 33 + 3 * 32 + 2 * 70 = 917. Thus, player 1 gets 4 - 3=1, 6-6 = 0, 5 - 0=5, 3 - 3 = 0, 3 - 2 = 1. Player 1 gave away 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. Player 1 is keeping one unit of item 1, 5 units of item 3, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\n    Accepting seems to be the best strategy given that I would otherwise need to risk the negotiation continuing to the next round where things would be discounted and where I am also under time pressure.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

That means I must \u201cconcede\u201d at most 57 units of value from my maximum in order for the deal to be at least as good as walking away. In a negotiation it is typical to share only a small part of the \u201csurplus\u201d beyond the disagreement value. In my case the surplus is 57 and even \u201csplitting\u201d that equally (roughly 28\u201329 each) would let me keep about 1025 while conceding about 28\u201329 in value. However, because my items are indivisible and some items (or units) matter much more to me than others, I want to concede items on which I have relatively low private value. In my value function the lowest\u2010valued item is item 4 (15 per unit). By giving away 2 units of item 4 I concede roughly 30 value (2\u00d715=30) and keep all of the higher\u2010value items, leaving me with a net value of 1054\u201330=1024\u2014well above the outside guarantee of 997. (This concession of 30 is slightly above the ideal \u201chalf\u2010surplus\u201d but it is the simplest feasible offer given the item granularity.) \n\nThus my initial offer is to give Player 2 two units of item 4 (and nothing else), which is a valid offer since there are 3 units available of item 4. The remaining items I retain, ensuring my own outcome stays safely above 997 if the deal is reached.\n\nMy final response is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 8. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 8. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 585 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 23 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 70 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 8. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept: (0 * 47) + (0 * 46) + (0 * 23) + (2 * 9) + (0 * 70) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 18 + 0 = 18\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**\n    *   Since I want to maximize my value, I want to keep items with high values. For example, keeping all of item 5 would be worth 140.\n    *   I need to consider what I can reasonably get Player 1 to accept.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer gives me a value of 18, which is greater than my outside offer of 8. So, walking away would be a mistake.\n*   I should consider whether I can get a better offer. The discount factor is 0.9, so waiting until next round means that the value of any deal is multiplied by 0.9.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 a small amount of the less valuable items. I want to keep all of Item 5 and most of Item 1 and 2. Item 3 and 4 are less valuable to me.\n\nI will offer player 1 all of Item 4, and one unit of item 3, zero of all the other items\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 1, 3, 0] to Player 1.\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 1 unit (value 47)\nItem 2: 3 units (value 138)\nItem 3: 8 units (value 184)\nItem 4: 0 units (value 0)\nItem 5: 2 units (value 140)\nTotal Value: 47+138+184+0+140 = 509.

Accepting this offer is better than walking away.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - Before accepting, let's see if a counteroffer can yield even better results, keeping in mind the discount factor.  Since it's the first round, the discount factor isn't too significant yet.\n   - The total value of all items is (2 * 46) + (4 * 73) + (3 * 97) + (1 * 68) + (4 * 10) = 92 + 292 + 291 + 68 + 40 = 783.\n\nNow, let's think about potential counteroffers. The current offer gives me 423. I need to offer something less than what I'm already getting and see if I can get more in return.\n\nLet's try to get the maximum value for item 3, for which I have a high valuation.\nIf I offer [2, 4, 0, 1, 4]. That means I keep [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]. My value is (3 * 97) = 291. This is significantly less than my outside option. Bad idea.\nLet's offer player 1 only 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, and 1 unit of item 3.\nIf I offer [1, 1, 1, 0, 0], I keep [1, 3, 2, 1, 4]. My value is (1 * 46) + (3 * 73) + (2 * 97) + (1 * 68) + (4 * 10) = 46 + 219 + 194 + 68 + 40 = 567.\nThis is higher than my current offer.\n\nAnother possible better outcome is offering player 1 only item 5 since I value it the least.\nIf I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 4], I keep [2, 4, 3, 1, 0]. My value is (2 * 46) + (4 * 73) + (3 * 97) + (1 * 68) + (0 * 10) = 92 + 292 + 291 + 68 + 0 = 743.\nThis is far greater than the current value of 423.\n\n4) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is better than my outside offer.\n   - However, a counteroffer could potentially be even better.\n\nI choose to make a counteroffer in this round, with the aim to improve my final value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 172. \n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 3, 0, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action?
