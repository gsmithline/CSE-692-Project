Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 260. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 0 + 19 x 0 + 85 x 2 + 35 x 2 + 19 x 1\n    which is 259 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 260. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

In the first round, the discount factor is 1 (0.9^0).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2.\n   - Consider potential counteroffers:\n       - My goal is to construct an offer keeping items that amount to a value greater than my outside offer of 260.\n       - Let's consider a potential offer where I keep a majority of the higher value items:\n         - If I make an initial offer [1, 2, 1, 2, 2] to Player 2:\n           - I would retain [2, 0, 3, 2, 0], generating value:\n             - 2 units of item 1 = 2 x 73 = 146\n             - 0 units of item 2 = 0 x 19 = 0\n             - 3 units of item 3 = 3 x 85 = 255\n             - 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 35 = 70\n             - 0 units of item 5 = 0 x 19 = 0\n           - Total value = 146 + 0 + 255 + 70 + 0 = 471\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since 471 > 260, this proposed counteroffer provides a value greater than my outside offer.\n   - It is sensible to propose a counteroffer since there is no current offer to accept and no clear indication that walking away is preferable.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]}",

I'll offer a division that attempts to meet these conditions:\n     - Keep: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n     - Offer: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n   - Value of this keeping proposal to me:\n     - \\(1 \\times 65 + 1 \\times 100 + 2 \\times 98 + 0 \\times 10 + 3 \\times 3 = 65 + 100 + 196 + 0 + 9 = 370\\)\n   - Thus, this offer does not exceed my outside offer. Let's adjust:\n     - New proposal: Keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n     - Offer: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n   - Value of keeping this proposal to me:\n     - \\(3 \\times 65 + 3 \\times 100 + 3 \\times 98 + 2 \\times 10 + 0 \\times 3 = 195 + 300 + 294 + 20 = 809\\)\n   - This is still less than my outside offer. I need to maximize my item 3 and item 2 where I have the highest individual per unit value:\n     - New better proposal: Keep 0/5/5/5/0\n     - Offer: 3/0/1/0/3\n     - Value of keeping this proposal:\n     - \\(0 \\times 65 + 5 \\times 100 + 5 \\times 98 + 5 \\times 10 + 0 \\times 3 = 0 + 500 + 490 + 50 + 0 = 1040\\)\n   - This proposal gives me 1040 value exceeding my fallback. Let's try a better one with little adjustment.\n   - Ideal proposal: Keep 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n   - Offer: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n   - Value for me of this proposal:\n   - \\(65 \\times 1 + 100 \\times 2 + 98 \\times 5 + 10 \\times 5 + 3 \\times 0 = 65 + 200 + 490 + 50 + 0 = 805\\)\n   - if it still doesn't reach 1137, do the reverse. I don't want to walk away.\n   - New proposal: Keep 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4\n   - Offer: 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n   - Total value:\n   - \\(5 \\times 65 + 5 \\times 100 + 0 \\times 98 + 3 \\times 10 + 2 \\times 3 = 325 + 500 + 0 + 30 + 6 = 861\\)\n   - New Ideal Proposal: Balance and Keep 5 of each.\n   - \\(0 \\times 1 + 5 \\times 2 + 5 \\times 3 + 0 \\times 4 + 2 \\times 5\\) lets consider this \n   - Evaluate this proposal....\n   - Offer using value of [65 * 5], 5, 0, 3, -5\\)\n\n**I'm choosing the counteroffer. I plan to offer Player 2 [2, 2, 1, 2, 0].**\n\nThis allows me to have:\n\n- My total value = \\(1 \\times 65 + 3 \\times 100 + 5 \\times 98 + 4 \\times 10 + 0 \\times 3 \n    = 65 + 300 + 490 + 40 = 895 \\)\n  - Use 2\n  - New Total \r\n  - My value = 1325\n- Offer Player 2 = 455\n  - \\(34 \\times 65 + 0 \\times 1 + 225 \\times 2 + 50 \\times 3  = 45664\n  - Total Verses 1344\n  - This is total mediation of 482 but shifted to 1312 offering greater value now\n\nThis is still under my outside offer. So I need to propose further balancing, which is 50 and 3. I'll propose collecting these items with very high value per item:\n\nI'm planning to submit a counteroffer to that sets values back at around 500 using this metric and double testing proposals.\n\nBased on simplifying removing over-reliance on misunderstanding, for the mediation is less threateningly high impact decision now.\n\nTherefore, this is not that difficult to manage or neglect following co-optimization. Soliciting that was good.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 284. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 284. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1020 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 4, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 1 + 36 x 0 + 25 x 4 + 95 x 1 + 96 x 0\n    which is 283 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 284. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 284. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1020 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 4, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 1 + 36 x 0 + 25 x 4 + 95 x 1 + 96 x 0\n    which is 283 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 284. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 2, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the current situation:\n\n1) **Analyze Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 284.\n   - The values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 88\n     - Item 2: 36\n     - Item 3: 25\n     - Item 4: 95\n     - Item 5: 96\n   - The total pool of items consists of:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 6 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor is 0.9, which means the value of the outcome is discounted by 0.9 after round 1. Since we are in round 2, the discount factor doesn't apply until round 3 for Player 2's final decision.\n\n2) **Assess the Values of Offers:**\n   - For the current offer on the table [0, 2, 3, 3, 3], my total value would be:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 88 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n     - Total value = 720\n\n   - Compare this to my outside offer value of 284. The current offer is quite favorable as it is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would mean securing a value of 720, which is substantially better than my outside offer of 284.\n   - Walking away would not be optimal as the current offer is much better than my fallback option.\n   - Making a counteroffer doesn't seem necessary since the current offer is already highly beneficial.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 50 x 1 + 86 x 4 + 3 x 2 + 91 x 3\n    which is 673 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 674. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 6, 0, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 3, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 5, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 5, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, let's evaluate the options step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside offer value:** 843\n- **Values of the items:**\n  - Item 1: 48\n  - Item 2: 29\n  - Item 3: 18\n  - Item 4: 31\n  - Item 5: 98\n- **Total pool of items:** [4, 4, 6, 6, 5]\n- **Discount factor:** 0.9\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current offer to you:** [0, 2, 5, 0, 0]\n  - Value calculation:\n    - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 48 = 0\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 29 = 58\n    - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 18 = 90\n    - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 31 = 0\n    - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 98 = 0\n  - Total value = 58 + 90 = 148\n  - Adjusted for discount = 148 \u00d7 (0.9^(2-1)) = 133.2, which is less than 843\n\nBased on the calculation, the current offer value (133.2) is much less than my outside offer value (843). Thus, accepting the current offer would be less favorable compared to just walking away with my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Should I accept the current offer?** No, because it is significantly less than my outside offer.\n- **Should I walk away?** This is a viable option since it guarantees 843.\n- **Should I propose a counteroffer?** Yes, to try and achieve a value higher than my outside offer, I need to propose a division where my share has a total value greater than 843.\n\nLet's calculate a possible counteroffer:\n- Target value after adjusting for the discount in future rounds should be greater than 843 / 0.9 = 936.67 (value undiscouned).\n- Possible division could focus on high-value items to maximize my retained value:\n  - Retain all 5 units of item 5 (5 \u00d7 98 = 490)\n  - Retain a majority share of item 1 (3 units \u00d7 48 = 144)\n  - Retain a decent share of item 4 for competitive value (3 units \u00d7 31 = 93)\n  - Keep a reasonable share of item 2 and item 3 (2 units \u00d7 29 = 58, 3 units \u00d7 18 = 54)\n  - Total value = 490 + 144 + 93 + 58 + 54 = 839\n\nThis is still slightly below the target undiscouned value, so slight adjustments can be made for optimization.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal by retaining more value in key items:**\n\n1. Retain all units of item with highest value (all 5 units of item 5).\n2. Offer 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, no units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n\nTherefore, I'll make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 3, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 2, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 2, 6]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, let's follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1125.\n   - Values of the items involved:\n     - Item 1: 46\n     - Item 2: 18\n     - Item 3: 73\n     - Item 4: 92\n     - Item 5: 39\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 7 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences value over rounds. If I were to accept in the first round, the value would be directly compared, but waiting might decrease the effective value due to discounting.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer value (if accepted)**:\n     - For [2, 2, 0, 2, 6], my total value would be:\n       - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n       - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n       - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 73 = 0\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 92 = 184\n       - Item 5: 6 \u00d7 39 = 234\n     - Total value = 92 + 36 + 0 + 184 + 234 = 546\n   - The current offer's value (546) is far below my outside offer value (1125).\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4) as it is worse than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away right now without attempting a counteroffer might also not maximize potential benefits, given it's still early.\n   - I should propose a specific counteroffer that gets me closer to or ideally above my outside offer's value.\n\nTo maximize value with a counteroffer, considering the total units:\n- Attempt to get more of the high-value items for me: Item 3, Item 4.\n\nHere's a counteroffer proposal:\n- Give Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 1, 3] (offer them 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5)\n- Which means I would retain: [4, 4, 1, 4, 4]\n\nCalculate my value for this:\n- Item 1: 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 18 = 72\n- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 73 = 73\n- Item 4: 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n- Total value = 184 + 72 + 73 + 368 + 156 = 853\n\nWhile this is still below my outside offer due to not having enough units to go beyond it, it's a better division closer to my needs for potential future rounds.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 5, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 10 x 2 + 78 x 5 + 10 x 4 + 10 x 1\n    which is 460 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 461. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To approach this negotiation game systematically, let's work through the provided steps:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 461.\n   - **Values of the Items Involved:**\n     - Item 1: 20 per unit\n     - Item 2: 10 per unit\n     - Item 3: 78 per unit\n     - Item 4: 10 per unit\n     - Item 5: 10 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 5 units\n     - Item 3: 6 units\n     - Item 4: 4 units\n     - Item 5: 1 unit\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** In this first round, the discount factor doesn't apply because it only influences the value of outcomes if the negotiation extends into subsequent rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Since there is no current offer from Player 2 to accept, my task is to create an initial offer that maximizes my value while ensuring it exceeds my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - **Objective:** I must ensure any offer gives me at least my outside offer value of 461. Therefore, I will calculate potential counteroffers and choose one that meets or exceeds this threshold.\n\nLet's consider potential offers:\n\n- I'll start by keeping as many high-value items as possible (i.e., Item 3) to maximize my retained value, as it has the highest value per unit.\n\nCalculate the value of keeping certain items:\n- Propose keeping [2, 3, 1, 2, 1] and giving Player 2 [0, 2, 5, 2, 0] as an offer.\n  - Value calculation:\n    - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n    - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 78 = 78\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n    - Total value to me = 40 + 30 + 78 + 20 + 10 = 178\n\nThis current proposal is nowhere near my outside offer, meaning I need to keep more items or choose those with higher values.\n\n- Adjust to keeping [2, 2, 2, 2, 1] and giving Player 2 [0, 3, 4, 2, 0] as an offer.\n  - New value calculation:\n    - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n    - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n    - Total value to me = 40 + 20 + 156 + 20 + 10 = 246\n\nThis is still below my outside offer, hence reevaluating to incorporate more high-value items:\n\n- New proposal: Keep [2, 2, 5, 3, 1] and give Player 2 [0, 3, 1, 1, 0]\n  - Value calculation:\n    - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n    - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n    - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 78 = 390\n    - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n    - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n    - Total value to me = 40 + 20 + 390 + 30 + 10 = 490\n\nThis proposal gives me enough value over my outside offer of 461 and is optimal for an initial offer. Therefore, I will offer Player 2 [0, 3, 1, 1, 0].\n\n**Decision:** I'm ready to propose this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Since we are in round 2, the discount factor applies as 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- Current offer [0, 5, 2, 2, 1] to me translates to:\n  - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n  - 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n  - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n  Total value: 0 + 50 + 156 + 20 + 10 = 236\n\n  Discounted total value for current offer: 236 \u00d7 0.9 = 212.4\n\n- Comparing this to my outside offer value of 461, I should aim for a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 461.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nSince the current offer gives me 212.4, which is much less than my outside offer of 461, I should not accept the current offer nor should I walk away at this point in time.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer that maximizes my received value. I will aim for a distribution that meets or exceeds my outside value. A potential division could be offering [0, 1, 3, 0, 0] items to Player 2, where I keep [2, 4, 3, 4, 1]:\n\n- My kept items would then be:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n  - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n  - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n  Total value: 364, which is admittedly less than my outside offer. \n\nSince the above value is less than my fallback, I need to iterate further to propose better alternatives that I inadvertently miscalculated the handholds for a better offer. A modified strategy based on maximizing certain highly valued items should aim for a maximized offer within item 3, to see if further adjustments meet the principal. I will thus attempt a direct converse.\n\nLet's revise to offer as its best potential against multiple iterations for trials to potentially offer better modifications and LTV combinations.

                    "response": "To make a decision, I need to evaluate the current situation and potential actions:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n    - **Outside Offer Value:** 606.\n    - **Values of the Items for Me:**\n      - Item 1: 82\n      - Item 2: 28\n      - Item 3: 100\n      - Item 4: 68\n      - Item 5: 35\n    - **Total Pool of Items:** 2 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n    - **Discount Factor (Gamma):** 0.9. As this is Round 2, the discount factor for this round will be gamma^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n    - **Current Offer:** [0, 3, 1, 1, 0]\n      - Value calculation for the current offer:\n        - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 82 = 0\n        - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n        - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n        - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n        - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n      \n      - **Total Value for Current Offer:** 84 + 100 + 68 = 252.\n      - **Discounted Value for Current Offer:** 252 \u00d7 0.9 = 226.8.\n\n    - **Comparison to Outside Offer Value:**\n      - The discounted value of the current offer is 226.8, which is less than my outside offer of 606.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n\nAs the discounted value of accepting the current offer (226.8) is less than my outside offer (606), accepting it would not be beneficial. Hence, I should either make a counteroffer that is likely to provide me a value higher than 606, or I should eventually WALK if no suitable offer is accepted by both parties and my outside offer remains the best option.\n\nGiven the negotiation history and my need to maximize my value, I will propose a counteroffer focused on retaining high-value items for myself.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\n\nMy counteroffer will focus on retaining more of items 3 and 4, which have high value for me, while still aiming for a balanced deal that Player 1 might consider acceptable.\n\n- I propose to give Player 1: [1, 3, 1, 2, 0]\n  - With this proposal, I keep:\n    - 1 units of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n    - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 100 = 500\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n  \n  - **Total Value for this Counteroffer:** 82 + 56 + 500 + 136 + 35 = 809.\n  - **Discounted Value for this Counteroffer:** 809 \u00d7 0.9 = 728.1.\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a discounted value of 728.1, which is higher than my outside offer of 606.

                    "response": "To decide my action, I need to assess the current offer and compare it to my outside option. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 480.\n- **Values of Items for Me**:\n  - Item 1: 56 per unit\n  - Item 2: 45 per unit\n  - Item 3: 46 per unit\n  - Item 4: 11 per unit\n  - Item 5: 27 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 6 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is 0.9, impacting the value if accepted in round 2 or 3.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: [1, 1, 1, 4, 2] (offered to me)\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n  - Value of 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 11 = 44\n  - Value of 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54\n  - Total Value = 56 + 45 + 46 + 44 + 54 = 245\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n  - The current offer provides a total value of 245, which is significantly less than my outside offer value of 480.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Accept the Current Offer?**: No, because 245 is less than my outside offer of 480.\n- **Walk Away?**: This is a potential option, but let's explore a counteroffer first.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?**: I should propose a counteroffer that would give me a value greater than 480.\n\n### Counteroffer Calculation\nTo justify staying in the negotiation, I need a deal that provides a better value than 480. If I keep all of the available items:\n- Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 56 = 112\n- Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 45 = 135\n- Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 46 = 138\n- Item 4: 6 units \u00d7 11 = 66\n- Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 27 = 54\n- Total potential value for me: 112 + 135 + 138 + 66 + 54 = 505\n\nSince I want to exceed the value of my outside offer weighted by round 1's discount (480), I need to offer a division where my remaining value exceeds 480. \n\nLet me make a counteroffer:\n- Offer: [0, 1, 1, 2, 0] to Player 1 (meaning I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5)\n\nFor me:\n- For item 1, I keep: 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n- For item 2, I keep: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n- For item 3, I keep: 2 \u00d7 46 = 92\n- For item 4, I keep: 4 \u00d7 11 = 44\n- For item 5, I keep: 2 \u00d7 27 = 54\n- Total Value to Me = 392\n\nUpon reassessment, this still doesn't exceed 480 due to what must be retained based on item maximums and the initial thought process. \n\nThus, a feasible action within consideration bounds where the divided retained to prioritize important value items like 1, 2 with some reductions yet yielding proportionally overall may be opting for target minimum negotiations for personal necessity yielding assurance contract will need adjustments with concurrent superior offers. Consequently, based on earlier surveyed item possible allocations maybe a maximized further potential alternate outcomes instead.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 493. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 282 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 7, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 3 + 13 x 5 + 36 x 7 + 4 x 4 + 35 x 4\n    which is 491 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 493. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Now let's consider how many items I would be leaving for Player 2:\n\n   Offer to Player 2 [0, 2, 1, 2, 2]:\n   - Item 1: 3 - 3 = 0\n   - Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2\n   - Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n   - Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2\n   - Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2\n\n   This offer gives me a substantial net gain compared to my outside offer while providing Player 2 with a fair amount of items. \n\n3) Decision Making:\n\nI should propose this as a counteroffer since it maximizes my value, which is more than my outside offer, reducing the risk of negotiation failure while ensuring I don't make any mistakes as per the error avoidance strategies laid out earlier.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 29 x 1 + 38 x 2 + 4 x 0\n    which is 105 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 107. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 679. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 810 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 1 + 12 x 2 + 77 x 2 + 76 x 2 + 81 x 4\n    which is 678 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 679. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Therefore, reaching an agreement sooner is more valuable in maintaining the total value of the items I keep.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2 to accept.\n   - I need to propose an initial counteroffer that maximizes my value above my outside offer value of 679.\n   - To propose a counteroffer, I will calculate the total value for a few potential divisions.\n\nFor example, let's calculate the value of a counteroffer where I keep a significant portion of high-value items:\n\nConsider offering player 2 the following:\n   - 1 unit of item 1\n   - 2 units of item 2\n   - 1 unit of item 3\n   - 1 unit of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n\nI would keep:\n   - 1 unit of item 1\n   - 1 unit of item 2\n   - 3 units of item 3\n   - 3 units of item 4\n   - 3 units of item 5\n\nCalculating the value for me:\n   - Value from item 1: 1 x 24 = 24\n   - Value from item 2: 1 x 12 = 12\n   - Value from item 3: 3 x 77 = 231\n   - Value from item 4: 3 x 76 = 228\n   - Value from item 5: 3 x 81 = 243\n   - Total value = 24 + 12 + 231 + 228 + 243 = 738\n\nThe value of 738 is above my outside offer of 679.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 1 + 12 x 2 + 77 x 2 + 76 x 2 + 81 x 4\n    which is 678 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 679. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 8, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 1 + 93 x 4 + 32 x 8 + 62 x 4 + 15 x 1\n    which is 939 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 940. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

To improve:\nCounteroffer by minimizing concessions on valuable item 2:\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 1, 7, 0, 1]\n   - For me: Keeping [4, 3, 1, 4, 0]\n     - Value of 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n     - Value of 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n     - Value of 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n     - Value of 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 15 = 0\n     - Total value = 751\n\n751 is also unviable.

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's go through each step thoroughly:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 680.\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 17\n  - Item 2: 42\n  - Item 3: 22\n  - Item 4: 89\n  - Item 5: 19\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 9 units\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 2 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. This means if the negotiation extends to the second round, the value I gain decreases slightly due to this factor.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Value of the Current Offer: [2, 1, 1, 0, 1]**\n  - Total value = (2 \u00d7 17) + (1 \u00d7 42) + (1 \u00d7 22) + (0 \u00d7 89) + (1 \u00d7 19) \n  - Total value = 34 + 42 + 22 + 0 + 19 = 117\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The value of the current offer (117) is substantially less than my outside offer value (680).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the current offer's value (117) compared to my outside offer (680), accepting this offer would be a mistake as it is far less valuable to me than walking away to claim my outside offer.\n\nSince this is the first round and I have the chance to negotiate further, making a counteroffer that improves my value significantly would be reasonable. Let's consider keeping more of the higher-value items:\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer:** Attempt to keep the higher value items like item 4. A balance might involve offering [1, 4, 2, 0, 2] to Player 1.\n\nLet's calculate this potential counteroffer's value to me: \n\n1. My units: [4, 5, 1, 2, 1] (as offered to the opponent [1, 4, 2, 0, 2])\n2. Value Calculation:\n   - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 17 = 68\n   - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 42 = 210\n   - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n   - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n   - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n   - Total value = 497\n\nThis is still less than 680, but since it's the first round, it positions me better tactically for subsequent rounds. I must be cautious not to make incremental errors like offering a worse deal later or compromising my outside offer value too much.\n\nTo iteratively improve my position without crossing strategic mistakes:\n\n- I propose a counteroffer [1, 4, 2, 0, 2].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis counteroffer is the most prudent action to attempt better leverage in round 1 without undershooting my outside value significantly. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 9, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 2 + 98 x 9 + 7 x 2 + 92 x 2 + 36 x 2\n    which is 1214 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1215. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since this is round 1, there's no immediate discount impact on potential acceptance in this round but influences future rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current Offer [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 97 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n     - Total value if I accept this offer = 71 + 4 = 75\n\n   - The current offer\u2019s value (75) is much lower than my outside offer value (585). Thus, accepting this offer is not beneficial.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer is not advantageous as the current offer's value (75) is far below my outside offer value (585).\n   - Walking away now would secure a value of 585, which is better than accepting the current offer but may not be optimal if a more favorable counteroffer can be proposed.\n   - Let's consider a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer, aiming to retain a maximum portion of high-value items.\n\nConsidering I need to exceed my outside offer value while making it potentially acceptable for Player 1:\n\nLet's create a counteroffer:\n- Give 2 units of item 1\n- Give 1 unit of item 2\n- Give 1 unit of item 3\n- Give 2 units of item 4\n- Give 3 units of item 5\n\nRetain:\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 14 = 84\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 71 = 284\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 97 = 388\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n\nTotal retained value = 870\n\nThis right now gives a retained value (870), providing flexibility for negotiations.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]}",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
