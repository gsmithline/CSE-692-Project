Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 513. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 513. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 0 + 66 x 1 + 57 x 2 + 71 x 1 + 87 x 3\n    which is 512 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 513. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best course of action in this negotiation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 513\n*   **My values for the items:** item 1: 13, item 2: 66, item 3: 57, item 4: 71, item 5: 87\n*   **Total pool of items:** 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is less valuable than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to construct an offer that maximizes my value while also being potentially acceptable to Player 2. Since there is no information about Player 2's values, I will aim for a fair split, leaning slightly in my favor, while ensuring my offer exceeds my outside option.\n\n3) **Develop a strategy and a counteroffer:**\n\nSince this is the first round, I have the opportunity to set the tone for the negotiation. I want to make a reasonable offer that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also securing a good outcome for myself. I'll start by considering an almost even split, skewed slightly in my favor to avoid Mistake 2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer), or mistake 3 (offering all items, or no items).\nLet's try giving Player 2 the following: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This means I would keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nMy value for this division would be:\n(3 * 13) + (2 * 66) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 71) + (2 * 87) = 39 + 132 + 57 + 71 + 174 = 473. This is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's iterate a bit, and try giving Player 2 the following: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This means I would keep 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nMy value for this division would be:\n(4 * 13) + (2 * 66) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 71) + (2 * 87) = 52 + 132 + 114 + 71 + 174 = 543. This is better than my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's try giving Player 2 even less to see if we can further optimize. Try giving Player 2 the following: 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5. This means I would keep 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nMy value for this division would be:\n(4 * 13) + (3 * 66) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 71) + (3 * 87) = 52 + 198 + 114 + 71 + 261 = 696. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n\nI will propose a counteroffer where I give Player 2 the following: 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 513.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 13, item 2 = 66, item 3 = 57, item 4 = 71, item 5 = 87.\n*   The total pool of items is: 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    *   My value for this offer is (0 * 13) + (1 * 66) + (0 * 57) + (0 * 71) + (2 * 87) = 0 + 66 + 0 + 0 + 174 = 240.\n    *   Since it's round 2, the discounted value is 240 * 0.9^(2-1) = 240 * 0.9 = 216.\n*   **Compare to outside offer:** 216 is much less than my outside offer of 513. Accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to keep items that I value highly. How about I offer the other player mostly items 1 and 3, while keeping most of 2, 4, and 5. I need to make sure I don't make Mistake 2, making an offer worse than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering [3, 0, 1, 0, 0] to the other player. That would mean I keep [2, 3, 1, 1, 3]. My value would be:\n(2 * 13) + (3 * 66) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 71) + (3 * 87) = 26 + 198 + 57 + 71 + 261 = 613.\nThe discounted value in round 2 is 613 * 0.9 = 551.7, which is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is terrible.\n*   Walking away gives me 513.\n*   Offering [3, 0, 1, 0, 0] gives me a discounted value of 551.7.\n*   The offer I made in round 1 was [1,0,0,0,0]. Let's see if this offer on the table is better than that:\nIf they accept [1,0,0,0,0], I keep [4, 3, 2, 1, 3]. My value is (4 * 13) + (3 * 66) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 71) + (3 * 87) = 52 + 198 + 114 + 71 + 261 = 696. 696 * 0.9 = 626.4, which is greater than the offer I made.\nSo the previous offer made is a better offer than the current offer.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. That means I keep [4, 3, 1, 1, 2]. My value is:\n(4 * 13) + (3 * 66) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 71) + (2 * 87) = 52 + 198 + 57 + 71 + 174 = 552.\nDiscounted value = 552 * 0.9 = 496.8, which is worse than walking.\n\nLet's try offering [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That means I keep [3, 3, 2, 1, 3].\n(3 * 13) + (3 * 66) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 71) + (3 * 87) = 39 + 198 + 114 + 71 + 261 = 683.\nDiscounted Value = 683 * 0.9 = 614.7.\nThis is also better than the outside offer.\n\nLet's offer [2, 0, 1, 0, 0]. That means I keep [3, 3, 1, 1, 3].\n(3 * 13) + (3 * 66) + (1 * 57) + (1 * 71) + (3 * 87) = 39 + 198 + 57 + 71 + 261 = 626.\nDiscounted value = 626 * 0.9 = 563.4\n\nLet's offer [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]. That means I keep [3, 3, 2, 1, 2].\n(3 * 13) + (3 * 66) + (2 * 57) + (1 * 71) + (2 * 87) = 39 + 198 + 114 + 71 + 174 = 596.\nDiscounted Value = 596 * 0.9 = 536.4.\n\nThe best of these options is to offer [2, 0, 1, 0, 0] for a discounted value of 563.4.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Walking away right now will secure me a value of 794, which is better than accepting the current offer. \n\nFurthermore, making a counteroffer should aim to achieve a value that exceeds my outside offer when multiplied by the discount factor (0.9), which is 794 / 0.9 \u2248 881. To do so, I must ensure the allocation I propose provides more than 881 in value to me.\n\nTherefore, I should attempt a **COUNTEROFFER** that gives Player 1 fewer high-value items, specifically:\n\n- Retain enough of the high-value items (Item 1, 2, 3) myself and offer the others to Player 1 in a way that maximizes my value given the constraint.\n\nLet's calculate a possible counteroffer:\n- Proposal: Give Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n  - I keep: [4, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n  - My value:\n    - 4 units of Item 1 = 400\n    - 2 units of Item 2 = 174\n    - 2 units of Item 3 = 162\n    - 1 unit of Item 4 = 35\n    - 2 units of Item 5 = 26\n  - Total = 797\n  - With discount factor: 797 \u00d7 0.9 \u2248 717.3\n\nThis does not meet the threshold of 881 in value, so it's better to walk. Instead of invalid proposals, I must choose to:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 82 x 1 + 77 x 3\n    which is 369 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 370. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

An even split would be: Player 2 gets [2, 1, 1, 2, 3] and I get [2, 2, 1, 2, 4].\n    My value: (2 * 19) + (2 * 67) + (1 * 56) + (2 * 82) + (4 * 77) = 38 + 134 + 56 + 164 + 308 = 700\n\nSince 700 is greater than 370, and it's beneficial to start the negotiation from a strong position, I can start with a reasonable split that is better than my outside option. Let's try to skew this a bit more towards me.\nLet Player 2 get [2, 1, 0, 1, 3].

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 370. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 82 x 1 + 77 x 3\n    which is 369 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 370. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the optimal action.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 370\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 19, Item 2: 67, Item 3: 56, Item 4: 82, Item 5: 77\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 7\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of an offer accepted in round 2, which is worth 90% of an offer accepted in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 19 = 19\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 67 = 0\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 56 = 56\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 82 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 77 = 154\n    *   Total value of current offer: 19 + 0 + 56 + 0 + 154 = 229\n\n*   **Comparing to outside offer:** 229 is less than my outside offer of 370. Accepting this offer would be a Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider the discount factor and the possibility of Player 2 walking away. I need to make an offer better than 370 in round 3 terms, which translates to 370 / 0.9 = ~411 in round 2 terms and 370 / (0.9)^2 = ~457 in round 1 terms.\n\n    *   **Keep everything:** 4 * 19 + 3 * 67 + 2 * 56 + 4 * 82 + 7 * 77 = 76 + 201 + 112 + 328 + 539 = 1256\n    *   **Offer the other player close to what they offered me:** My initial counteroffer should be better than what I have right now.\n\nLet's try to construct an offer that's better than my outside offer and also gives the other player more than what I am receiving now:\n\nI currently have a counteroffer of giving [2, 1, 0, 1, 3] to Player 2.

Let's try something around 75% to the other player.\n\nOffer [3, 2, 1, 3, 5]:\nItem 1: 4 - 3 = 1\nItem 2: 3 - 2 = 1\nItem 3: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 4: 4 - 3 = 1\nItem 5: 7 - 5 = 2\nTotal Value = 1*19 + 1*67 + 1*56 + 1*82 + 2*77 = 19 + 67 + 56 + 82 + 154 = 378\n\nThis offer is higher than my outside offer but only slightly.\n\nLet's try to offer [3, 2, 1, 3, 4]. This offer will hopefully result in a value that's more than my outside offer by a comfortable margin.\nTotal Value = 1*19 + 1*67 + 1*56 + 1*82 + 3*77 = 19 + 67 + 56 + 82 + 231 = 455\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible.

In this round (round 2), the applicable discount is \\(0.9^{1} = 0.9\\). This means any offer I accept now will be worth 90% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current offer ([3, 2, 1, 3, 4]):**\n     - Item 1: 3 units * 80 = 240\n     - Item 2: 2 units * 21 = 42\n     - Item 3: 1 unit * 70 = 70\n     - Item 4: 3 units * 65 = 195\n     - Item 5: 4 units * 60 = 240\n     - Total = 787\n     - Discounted Value = 787 * 0.9 = 708.3\n\n   - My outside offer is 724, which is greater than the discounted value of the current offer (708.3). Accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n     Considering my need to achieve a value at least equal to my outside offer (724 when discounted), I need to aim for a face value offer higher than my outside offer when adjusted for the discount. Given \\(724 / 0.9 \\approx 804.44\\), I need to configure an allocation that provides me with a value above this benchmark.\n\n     One potential counteroffer I will consider is maximizing the value of items most valuable to me:\n     - Give Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 3] units\n\n     **Value of the Counteroffer:**\n     - Keeping: \n       - Item 1: 3 * 80 = 240\n       - Item 2: 3 * 21 = 63\n       - Item 3: 2 * 70 = 140\n       - Item 4: 4 * 65 = 260\n       - Item 5: 4 * 60 = 240\n     - Total = 943\n\n     Discounted Value = 943 * 0.9 = 848.7, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   Based on the value assessments, I will propose a counteroffer that maximizes for my value over the outside offer, while staying within possible allocation limits.\n\nTherefore, my action will be: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 370. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 82 x 1 + 77 x 3\n    which is 369 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 370. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 3, 4]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 370\n*   **Item values:** Item 1 = 19, Item 2 = 67, Item 3 = 56, Item 4 = 82, Item 5 = 77\n*   **Total items:** 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]. This means I receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 19 = 19\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 67 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 3: 0 * 56 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 82 = 0\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 77 = 231\n    *   Total value of current offer: 19 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 231 = 250\n    *   Discounted value: 250 * 0.81 = 202.5\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (202.5) is significantly less than my outside offer (370). Therefore, accepting is not a good option.\n\n*   **Consider the history:** Player 2's offers have been consistently worse than Player 1's offers. Player 2 offered me very little in the current offer. This suggests they might be trying to force me to walk away.\n*   **Counteroffer:** I need to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. If I cannot find one I should WALK.\n\nLet's consider what the maximum value I can get. This would be receiving all the items:\n*   4 * 19 + 3 * 67 + 2 * 56 + 4 * 82 + 7 * 77 = 76 + 201 + 112 + 328 + 539 = 1256. With discount factor this is 1256 * 0.81 = 1017.36\n\nHere's how I can formulate a good counteroffer.\nWe want Player 2 to have an offer that gets them at least their outside offer. We don't know their outside offer, but we can look at their history of offers to get some idea of the minimum value they might need to accept.\n\nThe previous offers to Player 2 were:\nRound 1: [2, 1, 0, 1, 3] which means Player 2 gets [2, 2, 2, 3, 4]\nRound 2: [3, 2, 1, 3, 4] which means Player 2 gets [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\nI need to consider the units of each item left to allocate. I have 3 rounds.\n\nSince this is round 3, the risk is I can make one more offer or WALK. I need to improve my position.\n\nLet's propose a split that gives me slightly more than my outside offer, considering the discount factor.  Let's aim for a value of around 460 pre-discount, which is 460 * 0.81 = 372.6.\n\nLet's try keeping [1, 2, 1, 2, 4]\n\n1 * 19 + 2 * 67 + 1 * 56 + 2 * 82 + 4 * 77 = 19 + 134 + 56 + 164 + 308 = 681\n\nOkay, that's too much. Need to give more to Player 2. Let's try keeping: [0, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\n0 * 19 + 1 * 67 + 0 * 56 + 1 * 82 + 3 * 77 = 0 + 67 + 0 + 82 + 231 = 380\n\nThis is closer. So offer Player 2 [4, 2, 2, 3, 4]\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is significantly below my outside offer, and this is the last round, I will propose a counteroffer. Let's propose giving Player 2 [4, 2, 2, 3, 4], which means I keep [0, 1, 0, 1, 3]. This is worth 380 to me which is better than 370.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 2, 3, 4]}\n```",

Let's consider several potential offers.\n\n*   **Offer 1:** Give Player 2 half of everything possible.\n    *   Offer: [2, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n    *   My remaining items: [3, 1, 2, 4, 1]\n    *   My value: (3 * 61) + (1 * 90) + (2 * 74) + (4 * 21) + (1 * 86) = 183 + 90 + 148 + 84 + 86 = 591\n    *   This is greater than my outside offer of 444.\n\n*   **Offer 2:** Keep only valuable items.\n    *   Offer: [3, 1, 3, 7, 2]\n    *   My remaining items: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n    *   My value: (2 * 61) + (1 * 90) + (0 * 74) + (0 * 21) + (0 * 86) = 122 + 90 = 212\n    *   This is less than my outside offer of 444.\n\n*   **Offer 3:** Try to be more balanced while retaining higher value.\n    *   Offer: [1, 0, 1, 3, 0]\n    *   My remaining items: [4, 2, 2, 4, 2]\n    *   My value: (4 * 61) + (2 * 90) + (2 * 74) + (4 * 21) + (2 * 86) = 244 + 180 + 148 + 84 + 172 = 828\n    *   This is greater than my outside offer of 444.\n\n*   **Offer 4:** A slightly different distribution.\n    *   Offer: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n    *   My remaining items: [5, 2, 3, 4, 2]\n    *   My value: (5 * 61) + (2 * 90) + (3 * 74) + (4 * 21) + (2 * 86) = 305 + 180 + 222 + 84 + 172 = 963\n    *   This is greater than my outside offer of 444.\n\nComparing Offer 3 and 4.\n\n*   Offer 3 gives Player 2 some of the best items.\n*   Offer 4 still retains high value for myself.\n\nLet's go with Offer 4, as it has the highest value for me while also potentially being acceptable to the other player.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This means that any deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value would be: 0 * 61 + 0 * 90 + 0 * 74 + 2 * 21 + 1 * 86 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 42 + 86 = 128.\n    *   Since this is round 2, the discounted value of accepting the current offer is 128 * 0.9 = 115.2. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 444.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to ensure I get a value greater than my outside offer of 444.\n        Let's calculate what I would keep if I give Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] which they offered me earlier.\n        I would keep:\n        5 units of item 1 = 5 * 61 = 305\n        2 units of item 2 = 2 * 90 = 180\n        3 units of item 3 = 3 * 74 = 222\n        4 units of item 4 = 4 * 21 = 84\n        2 units of item 5 = 2 * 86 = 172\n        Total Value = 305 + 180 + 222 + 84 + 172 = 963.\n        Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 963 * 0.9 = 866.7\n\n        Let's consider offering [1, 0, 1, 4, 1] to Player 2\n        I would keep:\n        4 units of item 1 = 4 * 61 = 244\n        2 units of item 2 = 2 * 90 = 180\n        2 units of item 3 = 2 * 74 = 148\n        3 units of item 4 = 3 * 21 = 63\n        1 units of item 5 = 1 * 86 = 86\n        Total Value = 244 + 180 + 148 + 63 + 86 = 721.\n        Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 721 * 0.9 = 648.9\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer is terrible.

Given my values, I should try to keep as much of items 1, 2, 3, and 5 as possible. Let's try offering Player 2: [1, 0, 1, 4, 1]. In this scenario, I would receive 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5. As calculated previously, this yields me a discounted value of 648.9\n\n    A more aggressive offer could be [2, 1, 2, 5, 1].\n    I would keep:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 * 61 = 183\n    1 units of item 2 = 1 * 90 = 90\n    1 units of item 3 = 1 * 74 = 74\n    2 units of item 4 = 2 * 21 = 42\n    1 units of item 5 = 1 * 86 = 86\n    Total Value = 183 + 90 + 74 + 42 + 86 = 475\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 475 * 0.9 = 427.5. This is still not better than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try offering them [2, 0, 2, 6, 0]. I keep the rest.\n    I keep:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 * 61 = 183\n    2 units of item 2 = 2 * 90 = 180\n    1 units of item 3 = 1 * 74 = 74\n    1 units of item 4 = 1 * 21 = 21\n    2 units of item 5 = 2 * 86 = 172\n    Total Value = 183 + 180 + 74 + 21 + 172 = 630\n    Discounted value is 630 * 0.9 = 567\n\n    Let's try offering [2, 0, 2, 4, 0]. I keep the rest.\n    I keep:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 * 61 = 183\n    2 units of item 2 = 2 * 90 = 180\n    1 units of item 3 = 1 * 74 = 74\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 * 21 = 63\n    2 units of item 5 = 2 * 86 = 172\n    Total Value = 183 + 180 + 74 + 63 + 172 = 672\n    Discounted value is 672 * 0.9 = 604.8.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 308. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1104 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 101. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 0 + 68 x 1 + 24 x 0 + 8 x 4 + 73 x 0\n    which is 100 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 101. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 1, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 0 + 68 x 1 + 24 x 0 + 8 x 4 + 73 x 0\n    which is 100 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 101. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 1, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [4, 1, 1, 3, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

We need to give the items to Player 2, so let's see what happens if we offer them the reverse of the current offer [7,1,2,7,3]:\n        *   Remaining items for me: [1, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n        *   My Value = (1 * 27) + (3 * 68) + (1 * 24) + (0 * 8) + (0 * 73) = 27 + 204 + 24 = 255\n        *   Discounted value = 255 * 0.81 = 206.55 - The same as accepting the current offer, so we cannot improve the value in this scenario\n\n    * Now, what if we keep most valuable items and give less valuable items to Player 2\n        * Propose to Player 2: Item 1: 6, Item 2: 0, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 0.\n            * Player 1 value: (2*27) + (4*68) + (1*24) + (0*8) + (3*73) = 54+272+24+0+219 = 569\n            * Discounted value: 569*0.81 = 460.89. This is much better than the outside offer of 101.\n\n3.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    *   The current offer is worth 206.55, which is significantly better than the outside offer of 101.\n    *   We have identified a counteroffer that would lead to a value of 460.89\n    *   Therefore, let's submit this counteroffer\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 2, 7, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, we need to evaluate the current offer and potential counteroffers relative to my outside offer. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1. Analyze the current situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1128.\n- **Values of Items**: My private values per unit are:\n  - Item 1: 74\n  - Item 2: 12\n  - Item 3: 100\n  - Item 4: 13\n  - Item 5: 44\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 5 units of item 1,\n  - 10 units of item 2,\n  - 6 units of item 3,\n  - 3 units of item 4,\n  - 2 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, which affects my negotiating leverage over time. As we're in round 1, this doesn't affect current decisions but will if we proceed to future rounds.\n\n### 2. Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n  - My total value if I accept: \n    - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 74 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 100 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 13 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n  - Total value from current offer = 0 + 12 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 12\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: The current offer's value (12) is far less than my outside offer (1128).\n\n- **Counteroffer Assessment**: Any counteroffer needs to ensure that my value is greater than 1128, assuming Player 1 might accept it. Let's try calculating a beneficial division:\n  - If I keep all items, my total value would be 1217. A promising step is offering Player 1 items with lower value to me.\n\n### 3. Make a decision\n\nThe current offer is almost worthless compared to my outside offer, so I should definitely not accept it. Instead, I should make a counteroffer that maximizes my retention of valuable items to ensure my total exceeds 1128.\n\n### Counteroffer Proposal\nA strategy might be offering Player 1 less valuable items in exchange for keeping more highly valued ones to myself:\n\n1. Offer Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2 (96 value, minimal from my perspective), 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 (to equalize share further).\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 8, 0, 0, 1]\n\n### Final Action\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 8, 0, 0, 1]}",

For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 8, 6, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 5 + 69 x 8 + 78 x 6 + 9 x 3 + 81 x 2\n    which is 1214 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1239. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 8, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 8, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 1239\n*   My item values: item 1 = 1, item 2 = 69, item 3 = 78, item 4 = 9, item 5 = 81\n*   Total item pool: 5 units of item 1, 10 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am being offered [0, 8, 0, 0, 1]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n    *   Item 2: 10 - 8 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 0 = 6 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    My value for this offer is: (5 * 1) + (2 * 69) + (6 * 78) + (3 * 9) + (1 * 81) = 5 + 138 + 468 + 27 + 81 = 719.  Since this is round 2, my value is 719 * 0.9^(2-1) = 719 * 0.9 = 647.1.\n    This is much less than my outside offer of 1239, so I should not accept this.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 1239, after applying the discount factor.\n\nLet's consider some possible offers:\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1:** Give Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything. My value is (5 * 1) + (10 * 69) + (6 * 78) + (3 * 9) + (2 * 81) = 5 + 690 + 468 + 27 + 162 = 1352. After discounting, this is 1352 * 0.9 = 1216.8. This is still less than my outside offer of 1239, so this is bad.\n*   **Counteroffer 2:** Keep all of item 2, 3, and 5, give away all of item 1 and 4. So, give Player 2 [5, 0, 0, 3, 0]. My value is (10 * 69) + (6 * 78) + (2 * 81) = 690 + 468 + 162 = 1320. After discounting, this is 1320 * 0.9 = 1188. This is still less than my outside offer of 1239.\n*   **Counteroffer 3:** Let's try and get most of Item 2 and some of the other high-value items. Give Player 2 [5, 3, 3, 3, 0]. I keep [0, 7, 3, 0, 2]. My value is (7 * 69) + (3 * 78) + (2 * 81) = 483 + 234 + 162 = 879. After discounting, this is 879 * 0.9 = 791.1.\n*   **Counteroffer 4:** Give away all of item 1, 3, and 4. Give player 2 [5, 0, 6, 3, 0]. I keep [0, 10, 0, 0, 2]. My value is (10 * 69) + (2 * 81) = 690 + 162 = 852. After discounting, this is 852 * 0.9 = 766.8.\n\nI need to keep more high-value items.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 5:** Try to keep all of item 2 and most of item 5. Give player 2 [5, 0, 6, 3, 1]. I keep [0, 10, 0, 0, 1]. My value is (10 * 69) + (1 * 81) = 690 + 81 = 771. After discounting, this is 771 * 0.9 = 693.9.\n\nIt seems hard to get above my outside offer given the discounting. I should make a very aggressive offer to see if they bite.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 6:** Let's try giving them only the item with the lowest value. Give player 2 [5, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I keep [0, 10, 6, 3, 2]. My value is (10 * 69) + (6 * 78) + (3 * 9) + (2 * 81) = 690 + 468 + 27 + 162 = 1347. After discounting, this is 1347 * 0.9 = 1212.3. Still less than my outside offer of 1239.\n\nGiven the discount factor, it's difficult to get above my outside offer. The best thing to do is to walk away, unless I'm willing to accept less than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 456. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 17 x 4 + 99 x 2 + 60 x 2 + 23 x 3\n    which is 455 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 456. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

The discount factor will affect the value of accepting or making offers in later rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to formulate a counteroffer that maximizes my value while considering the potential for Player 2 to accept. I must ensure that I keep enough items to exceed my outside offer of 456.\n\n3) **Initial Counteroffer Strategy:**\n\nSince this is the first round, I will propose a counteroffer that gives Player 2 a significant portion of the items, but still leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer. I want to signal a willingness to negotiate but retain a strong position.\n\nLet's aim for an offer that gives Player 2 roughly half of the total value, while ensuring my remaining value is well above 456.\n\nHere's a potential counteroffer to Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 unit of item 5\n\nNow let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: (2-1) * 19 = 19\n*   Item 2: (5-3) * 17 = 34\n*   Item 3: (9-5) * 99 = 396\n*   Item 4: (2-1) * 60 = 60\n*   Item 5: (5-3) * 23 = 46\n*   Total value: 19 + 34 + 396 + 60 + 46 = 555\n\nThis total value of 555 is greater than my outside offer of 456.

If a deal is reached in round 1, the full value is obtained. In subsequent rounds, the value is multiplied by the discount factor raised to the power of (r-1). This means that delaying acceptance or counteroffers reduces the eventual value due to discounting.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [1, 3, 5, 1, 3] (the amounts being offered to me)\n     - Value calculation:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n       - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 36 = 180\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n     - Total value = 31 + 24 + 180 + 32 + 15 = 282\n     - Since 282 is less than my outside offer value of 469, accepting would be worse than accepting my outside offer.\n  \n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - I should not ACCEPT the current offer as its value (282) is less than my outside offer (469). This avoids mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse than my outside offer.\n   - I should not WALK as my outside offer is higher than the current offer\u2019s value, and I should consider counteroffers.\n\nTo make a counteroffer that is better than what Player 1 offered but still valuable enough to potentially be accepted by them, I need to propose a division that allows me to receive a minimum value higher than my outside option (469) when considering the discount factor. Let me compute the value from retaining more of the high-value items (item 3 and item 4):\n\nI propose keeping:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (31 value)\n- 5 units of item 3 (5 \u00d7 36 = 180 value)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (32 value)\n- The rest can be divided to Player 1.\n\nHere's a tentative proposal as a counteroffer:\n- [1, 2, 4, 1, 2] for Player 1 means I'm offering Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This leaves me with:\n  - 1 unit of item 1: 31\n  - 3 units of item 2: 24\n  - 5 units of item 3: 180\n  - 1 unit of item 4: 32\n  - 3 units of item 5: 15\n  - Total value: 31 + 24 + 180 + 32 + 15 = 282\n\nHowever, this total doesn't work as planned here, but let's attempt to keep a counteroffer higher than what has been made, and keep iterating. \n\nUltimately, I aim for a counteroffer where the value to me meets or exceeds my fallback value of 469, compensating for any reduction caused by any discount rate starting from next rounds.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 4, 1, 2]}\n```",

This means I get:\n      - 1 unit of item 1, value = 1 * 19 = 19\n      - 2 units of item 2, value = 2 * 17 = 34\n      - 4 units of item 3, value = 4 * 99 = 396\n      - 1 unit of item 4, value = 1 * 60 = 60\n      - 2 units of item 5, value = 2 * 23 = 46\n      - Total value = 19 + 34 + 396 + 60 + 46 = 555\n      - Discounted value = 555 * 0.9 = 499.5\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (555 * 0.9 = 499.5) is better than my outside offer (456).\n\n   - **Consider Player 1's previous offer:** Player 1 offered [1, 3, 5, 1, 3], meaning that Player 1 gets:\n      - 1 unit of item 1, value = 1 * 19 = 19\n      - 3 units of item 2, value = 3 * 17 = 51\n      - 5 units of item 3, value = 5 * 99 = 495\n      - 1 unit of item 4, value = 1 * 60 = 60\n      - 3 units of item 5, value = 3 * 23 = 69\n      - Total value = 19 + 51 + 495 + 60 + 69 = 694\n      - Discounted value = 694 * 0.9 = 624.6\n      \n   - **Potential counteroffers:** The current offer is pretty good. Let's consider if a better counteroffer exists. It needs to give us more than 456/0.9 = 506.67 in immediate value. I have 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5 left to allocate. Let's think, since the other player reduced the number of items they offered me, perhaps they need item 3 the most? Let me try offering [1, 3, 5, 1, 3] again.\n      - 1 unit of item 1, value = 1 * 19 = 19\n      - 3 units of item 2, value = 3 * 17 = 51\n      - 5 units of item 3, value = 5 * 99 = 495\n      - 1 unit of item 4, value = 1 * 60 = 60\n      - 3 units of item 5, value = 3 * 23 = 69\n      - Total value = 19 + 51 + 495 + 60 + 69 = 694\n      - Discounted value = 694 * 0.9 = 624.6\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer gives me a discounted value of 499.5.\n   - My outside offer gives me a value of 456.\n   - The current offer is better than my outside offer.\n   - The best outcome is to walk away in the last round. I will offer what I asked for last round to test the other agent again.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 5, 1, 3]}\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the optimal action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value is 771.\n    *   My values for items 1-5 are 67, 97, 98, 14, and 20, respectively.\n    *   The total pool of items is 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 9 units of item 5.\n    *   The discount factor is 0.9. Accepting an offer later means its value is multiplied by 0.9^(r-1), where r is the round number. In round 2, this factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 5]. This means I get:\n        *   0 units of item 1\n        *   1 unit of item 2\n        *   2 units of item 3\n        *   2 units of item 4\n        *   5 units of item 5\n        The total value of this offer to me is (0 * 67) + (1 * 97) + (2 * 98) + (2 * 14) + (5 * 20) = 0 + 97 + 196 + 28 + 100 = 421.\n        Since it is round 2, the discounted value is 421 * 0.9 = 378.9. This is much lower than my outside offer of 771. So accepting this offer is a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to construct a counteroffer that gives Player 2 some items while ensuring I retain enough value to exceed my discounted outside offer.\n    Let's start with aiming to keep half the items and see what the value would be.\n    * Keep [1, 1, 2, 2, 4] for myself. The value of this for me is 1*67 + 1*97 + 2*98 + 2*14 + 4*20 = 67 + 97 + 196 + 28 + 80 = 468\n    * Keep [2, 2, 3, 3, 5] for myself. The value of this for me is 2*67 + 2*97 + 3*98 + 3*14 + 5*20 = 134 + 194 + 294 + 42 + 100 = 764\n    * Keep [2, 3, 5, 5, 9] for myself. This is everything! The value is 2*67 + 3*97 + 5*98 + 5*14 + 9*20 = 134 + 291 + 490 + 70 + 180 = 1165\n    So the value of the current counteroffer to player 2 would be items [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and my value is 1165, greater than the outside offer, so this is feasible.\n    Another counter offer: offer [0, 0, 1, 2, 4]. My value then will be (2-0)*67 + (3-0)*97 + (5-1)*98 + (5-2)*14 + (9-4)*20 = 2*67 + 3*97 + 4*98 + 3*14 + 5*20 = 134+291+392+42+100 = 959. Since this will be further multiplied by 0.9, this gets 863. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer is unacceptable.\n    *   Walking away means I get 771.\n    *   I will propose a counteroffer.\n    *   Offering [0, 0, 1, 2, 4] will be more profitable than walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 2, 4]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 771. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 888 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 1 + 97 x 1 + 98 x 5 + 14 x 4 + 20 x 3\n    which is 770 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 771. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 2, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 5]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 2, 4]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 2, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 771\n*   My values for the items: item 1: 67, item 2: 97, item 3: 98, item 4: 14, item 5: 20\n*   Total items available: item 1: 2, item 2: 3, item 3: 5, item 4: 5, item 5: 9\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, if we reach a deal, the value will be multiplied by 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: Player 2 is offering me [0, 1, 2, 2, 5]. This means I would get:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   2 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   5 units of item 5\n    My value for this offer: (0 * 67) + (1 * 97) + (2 * 98) + (2 * 14) + (5 * 20) = 0 + 97 + 196 + 28 + 100 = 421\n    Considering the discount factor: 421 * 0.81 = 341.01\n\n*   Comparison to outside offer: 341.01 is much less than my outside offer of 771. Accepting the current offer is not a good option.\n\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to calculate an offer that would be better than 771 / 0.81 = 951.85. Let's try keeping everything for myself.\n    *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 67 = 134\n    *   3 units of item 2 = 3 * 97 = 291\n    *   5 units of item 3 = 5 * 98 = 490\n    *   5 units of item 4 = 5 * 14 = 70\n    *   9 units of item 5 = 9 * 20 = 180\n    *   Total value = 134 + 291 + 490 + 70 + 180 = 1165\n    1165 * 0.81 = 943.65. This isn't better than my adjusted outside offer (951.85). I'll try to find a better counteroffer.\n\n    I am in the last round, Player 2's counteroffer is equivalent to walking away if I don't accept.\n\n    Here, giving [0,0,0,0,0] to player 2 is better than the current offer as it allows me to get 1165 * 0.81 = 943.65\n    I can choose to walk away and get 771 * 1 = 771, or to accept player 2's previous offer of 341.01.\n    I can make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which will still result in a walk.\n\n    It seems that since I am in the last round, all counteroffers will be equivalent to walking away. However, to follow instructions, I will provide the offer with value closest to the outside offer when discounted.\n    Keeping everything results in: 943.65, and walking away results in 771.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nThe best option is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since it's round 1, the discount factor is 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what offer to make.

I want to offer Player 2 enough to be enticing, but also keep enough for myself to exceed my outside offer. I should start by making an offer that gives Player 2 slightly less than half of the total value.\n\nLet's try giving Player 2 the following:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 1\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 4\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 2\n\nMy value would be:\n4 * 86 + 4 * 61 + 2 * 18 + 5 * 11 + 2 * 55 = 344 + 244 + 36 + 55 + 110 = 789\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1107.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 8, 3, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 4 + 61 x 8 + 18 x 3 + 11 x 5 + 55 x 3\n    which is 1106 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1107. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1107. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 8, 3, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 4 + 61 x 8 + 18 x 3 + 11 x 5 + 55 x 3\n    which is 1106 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1107. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 8, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 1, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 1, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1107\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1: 86, Item 2: 61, Item 3: 18, Item 4: 11, Item 5: 55\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 7, Item 2: 8, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 9, Item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.

Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, a counteroffer will be treated as a walk, so there's no point in calculating potential counteroffers.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth significantly less than my outside offer, and making a counteroffer will be treated as a walk, my best option is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - I need to consider potential counteroffers and their value to me. I want to find an offer that is likely to be accepted while maximizing my value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I will make an initial counteroffer. I need to decide what to offer Player 2.\n\nNow, let's try to construct a reasonable initial offer.  A good starting point might be to offer Player 2 roughly half of the total value. However, I need to consider my own valuations. I value items 2 and 5 much higher than items 3. Therefore, it makes sense for me to try and keep more of items 2 and 5.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 the following:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy value for this would be:\n(1 * 37) + (3 * 91) + (3 * 4) + (3 * 76) + (3 * 94) = 37 + 273 + 12 + 228 + 282 = 832\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 973. Let's iterate on this.  I need to keep more high-value items. Let's try offering:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 1 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 1 units\n- Item 5: 1 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 4 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 5 units\n\nMy value for this would be:\n(1 * 37) + (4 * 91) + (3 * 4) + (4 * 76) + (5 * 94) = 37 + 364 + 12 + 304 + 470 = 1187\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 973.

Hence, I should not accept the current offer.\n   - Rejecting the current offer for a counteroffer requires ensuring the value to me should be greater than 1317.\n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer that maximizes my value:\n  - Aim for a counteroffer where my total value exceeds 1317, keeping in mind the possibility of game continuation and the discount factor.\n\nA feasible counteroffer would be:\n  - Keeping more high-value items for myself, for example:\n    - Giving away minimal units of items with the highest value to me.\n    - Offer [0, 0, 3, 2, 3] to Player 1. This gives me:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n      - 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 90 = 450\n      - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 44 = 132\n      - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n      - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n      - Total value = 1226\n\nThis counteroffer is still slightly below my outside option, which implies I should hold a more favorable division:\n- Adjusting to keep more of high-value items (4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5).\n\nRevisiting, strategize with something like offering [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]:\n- Doing the math for final total value:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 90 = 360\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 44 = 176\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 96 = 384\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 96 = 384\n- Total value = 1372\n\nThis new calculation offers me a value of 1372, which exceeds my outside option.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 0 + 91 x 2 + 4 x 4 + 76 x 4 + 94 x 5\n    which is 972 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 973. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 2].

Since this is round 2, and I'm Player 1, I should be willing to make an offer that gives Player 2 slightly more, if I can still improve my outcome after the discount factor.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Since the discounted value of accepting the current offer (1020.6) is already greater than my outside offer (973), accepting is a good option.\n\n   - Let's see if I can make an even *better* offer for myself by making Player 2 a *slightly* better offer, but still coming out ahead.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the deal, and a deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times the value of the deal.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - Current offer: [1, 1, 0, 0, 2] (This is what Player 2 is offering ME)\n        - This means I keep: [2-1, 4-1, 1-0, 3-0, 4-2] = [1, 3, 1, 3, 2]\n        - My value if I accept: (1 * 42) + (3 * 50) + (1 * 4) + (3 * 46) + (2 * 39) = 42 + 150 + 4 + 138 + 78 = 412\n        - Discounted value: 412 * 0.9 = 370.8\n\n    - Compare to outside offer: 370.8 > 112. Accepting the current offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n    - Potential counteroffers: I need to find an offer where what I keep is worth more than 112/0.9 = 124.44 (the discounted value of my outside offer in round 3), to make it advantageous to delay making a deal. Let's consider a few possibilities:\n    - Current offer is already very favorable for me. Player 2 gave a lot. It is hard to improve on it without being too greedy. \n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    - The current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, even considering the discount factor if I wait until the next round.\n    - I could make a counteroffer, but it's unlikely I'll get much more than the current offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 138. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 753 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The discount factor influences the value of future offers. Since it's round 1, the discount isn't directly relevant yet, but it will be in subsequent rounds.\n\n2) **Assessing Offers:**\n   - Current offer: None\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to propose a counteroffer that is greater than my outside offer (669). Let's explore some potential offers.\n\n3) **Decision-Making and Avoiding Mistakes:**\n   I need to propose an offer. My goal is to maximize my value, but I also need to make the offer attractive enough for Player 2 to consider it.\n\nLet's try a few possible offers and calculate their value to me:\n\n*   **Offer 1: Giving Player 2 half of everything (approximately):** [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n    My Keep: [2, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n    My Value: (2 * 74) + (1 * 52) + (1 * 11) + (3 * 97) + (2 * 67) = 148 + 52 + 11 + 291 + 134 = 636\n    This is less than my outside offer. So, not good. (Mistake 2)\n\n*   **Offer 2: Giving Player 2 less:** [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n    My Keep: [3, 2, 1, 4, 3]\n    My Value: (3 * 74) + (2 * 52) + (1 * 11) + (4 * 97) + (3 * 67) = 222 + 104 + 11 + 388 + 201 = 926\n    This is greater than my outside offer. Better.\n\n*   **Offer 3: Giving Player 2 a bit more than Offer 1:** [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n    My Keep: [3, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n    My Value: (3 * 74) + (1 * 52) + (1 * 11) + (3 * 97) + (2 * 67) = 222 + 52 + 11 + 291 + 134 = 710\n    This is also better than my outside offer.\n\nNow, I need to consider what Player 2 might value and accept. I don't know Player 2's values, so I'll start with Offer 2, which gives Player 2 something but keeps a larger share for myself, while ensuring I am still above my outside offer. I'll start with that offer in Round 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 0 + 52 x 2 + 11 x 1 + 97 x 5 + 67 x 1\n    which is 667 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 669. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 4 + 37 x 1 + 25 x 0 + 2 x 5 + 72 x 0\n    which is 267 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 270. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

I want to make an offer that is good enough for Player 2 to accept.\n\n*Offer 1:* Give Player 2 half of the items with quantities greater than 0, rounding down. Offer: [2, 1, 0, 2, 1]. My keeping would be [3, 1, 0, 3, 2]\nValue: 3 * 55 + 1 * 37 + 0 * 25 + 3 * 2 + 2 * 72 = 165 + 37 + 0 + 6 + 144 = 352.

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1. Therefore, it's better to get a good deal now rather than risk a worse deal later, but this needs to be balanced with the potential to get a *better* deal later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - There is no current offer.\n   - I need to consider potential counteroffers. I want to keep as much of item 3 as possible, as it's my highest value item. Item 2 is also valuable to me. Items 1, 4, and 5 are not as valuable to me individually.\n\n   Let's start by considering an offer where I give Player 2:\n      - 3 units of item 1\n      - 2 units of item 2\n      - 0 units of item 3\n      - 3 units of item 4\n      - 4 units of item 5\n\n   This means I keep:\n      - 0 units of item 1\n      - 2 units of item 2\n      - 1 unit of item 3\n      - 0 units of item 4\n      - 0 units of item 5\n\n   My value for this offer is: (0 * 12) + (2 * 64) + (1 * 93) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 11) = 0 + 128 + 93 + 0 + 0 = 221. This is greater than my outside offer of 213.\n\n   Let's also check one offer that is very favorable for me.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 757. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 897 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 6, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 0 + 27 x 3 + 70 x 6 + 74 x 3 + 33 x 1\n    which is 756 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 757. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 2 + 28 x 1 + 91 x 1 + 62 x 1 + 73 x 0\n    which is 289 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 290. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means I kept 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. This is worth (0 * 54) + (0 * 28) + (2 * 91) + (1 * 62) + (2 * 73) = 0 + 0 + 182 + 62 + 146 = 390. In retrospect, this was a pretty good offer.\n*   **Player 2 offered:** Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]. This means they kept 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n*   Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep at least my outside offer value. I need to keep at least 290/max(item_values) items with the highest item value to break even with the outside offer. So, let's look at item 3 with a value of 91.\n*   Consider keeping 2 of item 3 (worth 182). I need an additional 290-182=108. I can get this by keeping at least 2 of item 5, where my value is 73 (worth 146). So, keeping 2 of item 3, and 2 of item 5 gives me 182+146 = 328. So, I could offer [2, 4, 0, 3, 1].\n*   Consider offering [0, 4, 0, 3, 3] to Player 2. In this scenario I would keep item 1 and item 3: (2 * 54) + (2 * 91) = 108 + 182 = 290. This exactly matches my outside offer.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n\nAccepting the current offer is not good. Walking away would give me 290. My previous offer was better. Let me propose the following counteroffer to player 2: [0, 4, 0, 3, 3]. This way I keep all of item 1 and item 3. This is worth (2*54) + (2*91) = 108 + 182 = 290.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 0, 3, 3]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Let's consider a few examples.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1: Giving Player 2 a minimal amount**\n        *   Offer: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] - This means Player 2 gets 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, and 1 unit of item 3.\n\n        *   My remaining items: [2, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n        *   My value: (2 * 78) + (2 * 93) + (2 * 90) + (1 * 61) + (2 * 33) = 156 + 186 + 180 + 61 + 66 = 649.

This is LESS than my outside offer, so this offer is bad.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince I need to make a first offer, and I need to ensure it is better than my outside offer, I want to keep as many high value items as possible. Also, to avoid Mistake 3, I want to offer something to the opponent, rather than nothing. Let's test another offer:\n\n*  **Scenario 5: Giving Player 2 the lowest value items**\n         *  Offer: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] - This means Player 2 gets 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n         *  My remaining items: [3, 3, 3, 0, 1]\n         *   My value: (3 * 78) + (3 * 93) + (3 * 90) + (0 * 61) + (1 * 33) = 234 + 279 + 270 + 0 + 33 = 816.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Accepting it would be detrimental.\n   \n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - **Accept the current offer?** No, because its value to me (20) is much lower than my outside offer (279).\n   - **Walk away?** Not yet, since we might negotiate a better offer.\n   - **Propose a counteroffer?** Yes, since the current offer is unacceptable, I should propose one that gives me more.\n  \n   Given these considerations, let's propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while leaving room for negotiation.\n\n   **Proposing a counteroffer:**\n\n   - I want to keep the highest value items for myself, therefore I should aim to keep all units of items that I value the most or that contribute less to the other player.\n   - A potential counteroffer could be: [0, 1, 2, 0, 0].\n   - This means I am offering Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5, keeping high-value items for myself.\n\n   Let's calculate the total value for me if I make this counteroffer:\n   - I keep: \n     - 3 units of item 1 worth: 3 * 96 = 288\n     - 2 units of item 2 worth: 2 * 60 = 120\n     - 1 unit of item 3 worth: 1 * 32 = 32\n     - 1 unit of item 5 worth: 1 * 14 = 14\n   - Total value = 288 + 120 + 32 + 14 = 454\n\n   Since 454 is much greater than my outside offer of 279, this counteroffer is viable.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 704. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 3 + 93 x 3 + 90 x 1 + 61 x 1 + 33 x 1\n    which is 697 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 704. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, I will go through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 857\n   - Values of the items involved:\n     - Item 1: 95 per unit\n     - Item 2: 1 per unit\n     - Item 3: 30 per unit\n     - Item 4: 47 per unit\n     - Item 5: 15 per unit\n   - Total pool of items: [7, 5, 4, 4, 0]\n   - Discount factor: 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current offer** from Player 1 (for me): [3, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 x 95 = 285\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 x 1 = 2\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 30 = 60\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 47 = 94\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 x 15 = 0\n     - Total value = 285 + 2 + 60 + 94 = 441\n   - The current offer provides me with a value of 441.\n   - Since it is the first round, the discount factor doesn't apply.\n\n3) **Comparison and Decision:**\n   - The current offer (441) is less than my outside offer (857).\n   - Therefore, the current offer is not acceptable (Mistake 4: Accepting a worse offer).\n   - I should not walk away immediately as there may be a better offer or counteroffer possible (Mistake 5: Walking away from a better offer).\n\n**Propose a Counteroffer:**\nTo maximize my value, the goal is to propose a distribution where my value is at least 857 or close to it, adjusted by the future potential negotiation rounds.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I aim for at least the following distribution, effectively keeping more high-value items:\n\n- Allocate more of item 1 to myself, since it holds the highest value for me.\n- Counteroffer: [1, 4, 2, 2, 0] (This means I give Player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of this proposed counteroffer to myself:\n\n- My allocation: [6, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n  - 6 units of item 1 = 6 x 95 = 570\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 x 1 = 1\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 30 = 60\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 47 = 94\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 x 15 = 0\n  - Total value = 570 + 1 + 60 + 94 = 725\n\nHowever, this total is less than my outside offer of 857. As no division allows me to directly surpass 857, I will attempt to move closer to it while maximizing my bargaining position. But since it doesn't match my outside value, accepting an offer is preferable unless they propose a more enticing deal.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will make a strategic counteroffer. However, since I cannot propose a clear dominant response, I will choose to improve slightly on the basis of potential negotiation gain.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 15 x 3 + 33 x 1 + 85 x 0\n    which is 78 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 79. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I will adjust slightly to get closer to my outside offer in this round:\n\nKeeping:\n- 7 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n\nOffering Player 1:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n\nCalculating my value:\n- 7 units of item 1 = 7 \u00d7 95 = 665\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n- Total value = 665 + 1 + 60 + 94 = 820\n\nGiven the circumstances, while still less than 857, this is an assertive counteroffer to consider Player 1's potential adjustments in the final round.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 2, 2, 0]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 57 for item 1, 7 for item 2, 15 for item 3, 33 for item 4, 85 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 626. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 79. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 79. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 591 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 15 x 3 + 33 x 1 + 85 x 0\n    which is 78 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 79. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 3, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 79.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 57, item 2 = 7, item 3 = 15, item 4 = 33, item 5 = 85.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1 = 7, item 2 = 5, item 3 = 4, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 0.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. Since it is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. This means accepting an offer now is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 4, 2, 2, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 0 = 7 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 4 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n    Value of current offer = (7 * 57) + (1 * 7) + (2 * 15) + (2 * 33) + (0 * 85) = 399 + 7 + 30 + 66 + 0 = 502\n    Discounted value of current offer = 502 * 0.81 = 406.62\n\n*   **Outside offer:** My outside offer is 79. Since it is discounted, my value remains 79*0.81 = 63.99 if negotiations fail.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider if I can make a counteroffer that is better than the current offer and my outside option. Given that it is the final round, any counteroffer will be treated as a walk for player 2. Therefore if they don't accept, I get my outside option discounted.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The discounted value of accepting the current offer (406.62) is significantly greater than my discounted outside offer (63.99).\n*   Since this is the last round, any counteroffer is as good as walking away.\n*   Therefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
