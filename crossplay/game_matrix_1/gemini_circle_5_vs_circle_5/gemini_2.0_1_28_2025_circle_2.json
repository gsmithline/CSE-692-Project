I need to make an initial offer to Player 2.\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's values, a reasonable starting point is to propose a split that gives Player 2 roughly half the total value, assuming their values are similar to mine. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully results in a deal that exceeds my outside offer.\n\nHere's my item valuation:\nItem 1: 61 (2 units available)\nItem 2: 98 (1 unit available)\nItem 3: 83 (8 units available)\nItem 4: 80 (1 unit available)\nItem 5: 83 (7 units available)\n\nMy total value for all items is 1545.\n\nI will start by giving player 2 roughly half of each item, rounded down.\nItem 1: Offer 1 unit to Player 2. Keep 1 unit for myself. Value to me: 1 * 61 = 61\nItem 2: Offer 0 unit to Player 2. Keep 1 unit for myself. Value to me: 1 * 98 = 98\nItem 3: Offer 4 unit to Player 2. Keep 4 unit for myself. Value to me: 4 * 83 = 332\nItem 4: Offer 0 unit to Player 2. Keep 1 unit for myself. Value to me: 1 * 80 = 80\nItem 5: Offer 3 unit to Player 2. Keep 4 unit for myself. Value to me: 4 * 83 = 332\n\nTotal value to me for this offer is 61 + 98 + 332 + 80 + 332 = 903.\n\nI think it is best to try and secure a larger proportion of the higher-value items for myself. Let's revise the initial offer to give more of Item 3 and 5 to the other player and retain Item 2 and Item 4.\nItem 1: Offer 1 unit to Player 2. Keep 1 unit for myself. Value to me: 1 * 61 = 61\nItem 2: Offer 0 unit to Player 2. Keep 1 unit for myself. Value to me: 1 * 98 = 98\nItem 3: Offer 5 unit to Player 2. Keep 3 unit for myself. Value to me: 3 * 83 = 249\nItem 4: Offer 0 unit to Player 2. Keep 1 unit for myself. Value to me: 1 * 80 = 80\nItem 5: Offer 4 unit to Player 2. Keep 3 unit for myself. Value to me: 3 * 83 = 249\nTotal value to me for this offer is 61 + 98 + 249 + 80 + 249 = 737\n\nSince I can't predict Player 2's exact valuation, I will give a more favorable distribution to player 2 to see if they will accept.\n\nItem 1: Offer 1 unit to Player 2. Keep 1 unit for myself. Value to me: 1 * 61 = 61\nItem 2: Offer 0 unit to Player 2. Keep 1 unit for myself. Value to me: 1 * 98 = 98\nItem 3: Offer 6 unit to Player 2. Keep 2 unit for myself. Value to me: 2 * 83 = 166\nItem 4: Offer 0 unit to Player 2. Keep 1 unit for myself. Value to me: 1 * 80 = 80\nItem 5: Offer 5 unit to Player 2. Keep 2 unit for myself. Value to me: 2 * 83 = 166\nTotal value to me for this offer is 61 + 98 + 166 + 80 + 166 = 571\n\nOkay, I will start with a more generous offer to Player 2 and hope for a quick acceptance.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 6, 0, 5]}\n```",

So the present value of the current offer to me is 405 * 0.9 = 364.5\n\nMy outside offer is 1469.\n\nSince 364.5 < 1469, accepting the current offer is not a good idea.

I believe Player 2 will not accept anything less than their round 1 discounted value they would get from the deal.\n\nLet's aim for a split where I get at least slightly better than my outside offer when discounted for one round. This means I want to find an allocation that gives me (1469 / 0.9) \u2248 1632.22.\n\nTo get a value close to 1632.22 for myself, I should aim for something close to:\n* Item 1: 2 units (2 * 61 = 122)\n* Item 2: 1 unit (1 * 98 = 98)\n* Item 3: 8 units (8 * 83 = 664)\n* Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 80 = 80)\n* Item 5: 7 units (7 * 83 = 581)\nTotal = 122 + 98 + 664 + 80 + 581 = 1545\n\nSince the items are indivisible, this is the best possible outcome I can expect. The corresponding offer to Player 2 would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So I would be getting almost my total value.\n\nI need to give Player 2 something, or they will walk. To figure out what offer to give, let's look at Player 2's offer. If I accepted their round 1 offer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], they would have been left with [1, 0, 7, 0, 6]. So I need to make an offer slightly better than that.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that gives Player 2 very little, but more than nothing. I'll propose giving Player 2 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would get [2, 1, 7, 1, 7]. My value from that would be (2 * 61) + (1 * 98) + (7 * 83) + (1 * 80) + (7 * 83) = 122 + 98 + 581 + 80 + 581 = 1462. After discounting, this becomes 1462 * 0.9 = 1315.8. This is still less than my outside offer!\n\nLet's propose giving Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then my discounted value becomes 1545 * 0.9 = 1390.5. This is still not better than my outside offer!\n\nTherefore, the best approach for me is to walk, which gives me my outside offer immediately.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I want to maximize my expected payoff, taking into account the discount factor and the possibility of Player 2 walking away.\n\nA reasonable strategy is to start with a relatively fair offer and see how Player 2 responds. I will offer Player 2 slightly more than half the value of the goods, hoping they will accept. To do this I have to determine the value of the items to player 2, and then try to offer them more than half of that amount in terms of the items value to them. Since I don't know these values it is hard to make a reasonable offer off the bat, so I will instead aim for roughly 2/3 of the items and see how Player 2 responds. This gives a rough value of 852 / 3 = 284 for player 2 and me keeping 568.\n\nI am going to propose giving Player 2:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 1 unit\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 3 units\nItem 2: 2 units\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 4 units\nItem 5: 3 units\n\nMy value for this would be:\nItem 1: 3 * 20 = 60\nItem 2: 2 * 25 = 50\nItem 3: 2 * 27 = 54\nItem 4: 4 * 80 = 320\nItem 5: 3 * 29 = 87\nTotal = 60 + 50 + 54 + 320 + 87 = 571\n\nThis is substantially above my outside option of 203, so it should be acceptable.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

Since 90 < 203, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, I need to decide if I should make a counteroffer.

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, considering my outside offer of 665.\n\nI need to estimate what Player 2 might accept. Since the values are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101, a \"fair\" split would give each player roughly half the total value. However, I need to offer enough to entice Player 2 to accept, but not so much that I leave myself with less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items based on *my* values:\n* Item 1: 4 units * 80 = 320\n* Item 2: 3 units * 56 = 168\n* Item 3: 4 units * 37 = 148\n* Item 4: 5 units * 55 = 275\n* Item 5: 0 units * 88 = 0\nTotal value for me = 320 + 168 + 148 + 275 + 0 = 911\n\nTo get a sense of a potentially acceptable offer, let's start by giving Player 2 slightly more than half the items, and see what value that represents for me, keeping in mind I need to exceed 665. Let's try offering Player 2 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 2 units * 80 = 160\n* Item 2: 1 units * 56 = 56\n* Item 3: 2 units * 37 = 74\n* Item 4: 2 units * 55 = 110\n* Item 5: 0 units * 88 = 0\nTotal value for me = 160 + 56 + 74 + 110 = 400. This is much lower than my outside offer.\n\nI need to retain much more. Let's try an offer that gives Player 2 only 1 unit each of items 1, 2, 3 and 4. This will make it a very unattractive offer for Player 2, but I need a starting point.\n\nThis leaves me with:\n* Item 1: 3 units * 80 = 240\n* Item 2: 2 units * 56 = 112\n* Item 3: 3 units * 37 = 111\n* Item 4: 4 units * 55 = 220\n* Item 5: 0 units * 88 = 0\nTotal value for me = 240 + 112 + 111 + 220 = 683.\n\nThis is higher than my outside offer.

My private values are 63, 42, 48, 30, and 11 for items 1 through 5, respectively. My outside offer is 486. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer:\n- Item 1: 1 unit * 63 = 63\n- Item 2: 2 units * 42 = 84\n- Item 3: 2 units * 48 = 96\n- Item 4: 2 units * 30 = 60\n- Item 5: 4 units * 11 = 44\nTotal value of the offer = 63 + 84 + 96 + 60 + 44 = 347\n\nSince it's round 2, this value needs to be discounted by a factor of 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So, the present value of accepting this offer is 347 * 0.9 = 312.3.\n\nThis is much less than my outside offer of 486. I need to consider making a counteroffer. To maximize my value, I want to give Player 2 just enough to make them accept.  Let's aim to get a deal that's just slightly better than their outside offer, assuming we knew it. Since we don't know it, we can only approximate. Also, the total available is fixed. The more I offer them, the less I get. We need to make sure we get at least 486 after discounting, meaning before discounting we need at least 486/0.9 = 540.\n\nThe current offer gives me 312.3.\nI have 2, 3, 4, 3, 8 units in total for items 1 through 5. If Player 2 has 1, 2, 2, 2, 4 then that means I have:\nItem 1: 2-1 = 1 unit\nItem 2: 3-2 = 1 unit\nItem 3: 4-2 = 2 units\nItem 4: 3-2 = 1 unit\nItem 5: 8-4 = 4 units\n\nSo, what if I make a counteroffer where they get everything I initially offered them, plus some more such that I end up with a value of around 540? I need to figure out a counter offer to make to the other player.\n\nConsider offering Player 2 [1,2,3,2,6]. That leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n- Item 2: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n- Item 3: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n- Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n- Item 5: 8 - 6 = 2 unit\n\nValue to me would be:\n1*63 + 1*42 + 1*48 + 1*30 + 2*11 = 63+42+48+30+22 = 205.\nDiscounted value: 205*0.9 = 184.5 which is less than 486, meaning I'm better off walking away.\n\nIf I offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That means I keep everything\n2*63 + 3*42 + 4*48 + 3*30 + 8*11 = 126 + 126 + 192 + 90 + 88 = 622\nDiscounted = 622 * 0.9 = 559.8. I need to figure out the best offer to get close to 486.\n\nLet me try a very greedy offer to Player 2 and see where this leaves me.\nCounteroffer [0,0,0,0,0].

This means any deal I accept must be worth at least 665 * 0.9^(r-1), where r is the round number.\n\nSince this is round 1, any deal I accept must be worth at least 665.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my outcome, but also to consider the other player's possible actions and values (though I don't know their actual values). A reasonable starting point is to propose a split that gives the other player slightly more than half of the total value, hoping they accept. Given the risk of walking away, I don't want to be too greedy. I will target a split that gives them about 50% of what I value the items, but in such a way as to maximize my return given that I want to offer about half the total value.\n\nI want to offer the other player approximately 505 in value, which they can accept.\n\nLet us assume the other player values the items somewhat equally. I have to decide the exact allocation to offer. Since I value Item 1 very highly, I will offer less of that. I value Item 3 relatively low, so I'll offer more of that.\n\nLet's propose the following offer:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 2 units\n*   Item 3: 3 units\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 1 unit\n\nValue to player 1:\n\n*   3 * 91 = 273\n*   1 * 44 = 44\n*   2 * 24 = 48\n*   1 * 39 = 39\n*   2 * 75 = 150\n\nTotal value = 273 + 44 + 48 + 39 + 150 = 554\n\nThe value I am offering to player 2 is the total value less what I am keeping: 1010 - 554 = 456\n\nSince this value is lower than my outside offer, it seems like a poor offer. Therefore, I should be offering more.\n\nLet's try offering:\n\n*   Item 1: 1 unit\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 4 units\n*   Item 4: 0 unit\n*   Item 5: 0 unit\n\nValue to player 1:\n\n*   4 * 91 = 364\n*   2 * 44 = 88\n*   1 * 24 = 24\n*   2 * 39 = 78\n*   3 * 75 = 225\n\nTotal value = 364 + 88 + 24 + 78 + 225 = 779\n\nThe value I am offering to player 2 is the total value less what I am keeping: 1010 - 779 = 231\n\nThis is way too low. Let's try offering what's left to give away (since I need to offer a minimum of 665)\n\n665 = (1 to 101) * item 1 + (1 to 101) * item 2 + ...\n\nIt's impossible to know player 2's values, so I will need to make a reasonable guess.\n\nLet's offer a more balanced division.\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nValue to player 1:\nItem 1: 3 * 91 = 273\nItem 2: 2 * 44 = 88\nItem 3: 2 * 24 = 48\nItem 4: 1 * 39 = 39\nItem 5: 2 * 75 = 150\nTotal: 598\nValue to player 2: 1010 - 598 = 412.\n\nI am not even reaching my outside offer. I want more! So I will offer the following:\n\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nValue to player 1:\nItem 1: 4 * 91 = 364\nItem 2: 2 * 44 = 88\nItem 3: 3 * 24 = 72\nItem 4: 1 * 39 = 39\nItem 5: 2 * 75 = 150\nTotal: 713\nValue to player 2: 1010 - 713 = 297\n\nI will propose this as my offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

My value is then:\n91(5-x1) + 44(3-x2) + 24(5-x3) + 39(2-x4) + 75(3-x5)\n= 455 - 91x1 + 132 - 44x2 + 120 - 24x3 + 78 - 39x4 + 225 - 75x5\n= 1010 - 91x1 - 44x2 - 24x3 - 39x4 - 75x5\nI want this value times 0.9 to be at least my outside offer of 665. So, 0.9(1010 - 91x1 - 44x2 - 24x3 - 39x4 - 75x5) >= 665\n1010 - 91x1 - 44x2 - 24x3 - 39x4 - 75x5 >= 665/0.9 = 738.89\n91x1 + 44x2 + 24x3 + 39x4 + 75x5 <= 1010 - 738.89 = 271.11\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 a bit more than they previously offered.\nI will offer Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nThen my value becomes 1010 - (91 + 44 + 24 + 39 + 75) = 1010 - 273 = 737.\nDiscounted, this becomes 737 * 0.9 = 663.3. This is slightly below my outside offer of 665.\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 0].\nThen my value becomes 1010 - (91 + 44 + 24 + 39 + 0) = 1010 - 198 = 812.\nDiscounted, this becomes 812 * 0.9 = 730.8. This is above my outside offer of 665. So, this is a promising direction.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 1, 1, 0, 1].\nMy value would be 1010 - (91 + 44 + 24 + 0 + 75) = 1010 - 234 = 776\nDiscounted, this is 776 * 0.9 = 698.4 > 665.

I'll aim for a split that gives me something greater than my discounted outside offer.\n\nThe total amount of items we have are:\n* Item 1: 5\n* Item 2: 3\n* Item 3: 5\n* Item 4: 2\n* Item 5: 3\nMy values are: 100, 97, 72, 32, 79\nPlayer 1's values are unknown.\nIt is difficult to offer a counteroffer in this round that is better than 479.7 and also better than their discounted outside offer. Let's assume Player 1's outside offer is small. I'll try to make a slightly more generous offer with the intent to get accepted. I'll offer [1, 1, 2, 0, 1].\n\nNow I get:\n*   Item 1: 1 unit\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 0 units\n*   Item 5: 0 unit\n\nMy counteroffer gives them [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]. That leaves me with:\n\n* Item 1: 4\n* Item 2: 2\n* Item 3: 3\n* Item 4: 2\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis offer to me is: (4 * 100) + (2 * 97) + (3 * 72) + (2 * 32) + (2 * 79) = 400 + 194 + 216 + 64 + 158 = 1032. Discounted, this is 1032 * 0.9 = 928.8, which is greater than my outside offer of 533.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

I want to maximize my value, so I should try to get as much of items I value highly (items 1, 3, and 5) as possible, while giving away items I value less (items 2 and 4).\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 a potential counteroffer and evaluating its value to me.

Value = 1 * 62 = 62\nItem 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit. Value = 1 * 30 = 30\nItem 3: 4 - 2 = 2 units. Value = 2 * 96 = 192\nItem 4: 1 - 0 = 1 unit. Value = 1 * 8 = 8\nItem 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units.

So this could be a reasonable starting point for negotiation.\n\nLet's try a different proposal, one more advantageous to me and see if it works:\nOffer Player 1: [0, 2, 3, 1, 3]\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 2 - 0 = 2 units. Value = 2 * 62 = 124\nItem 2: 2 - 2 = 0 units. Value = 0 * 30 = 0\nItem 3: 4 - 3 = 1 units. Value = 1 * 96 = 96\nItem 4: 1 - 1 = 0 units. Value = 0 * 8 = 0\nItem 5: 4 - 3 = 1 units. Value = 1 * 53 = 53\nTotal value = 124 + 0 + 96 + 0 + 53 = 273\n\nThis is not better than the outside offer, so it is no good.\n\nLet's go back to the first proposed offer, it looks reasonable for a first round offer.\nCOUNTEROFFER: [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

This time:\n\n* Item 1: 1 unit (1 * 50 = 50 for me, leaving 4 units at 200)\n* Item 2: 1 unit (1 * 64 = 64 for me, leaving 3 units at 192)\n* Item 3: 0 units (0 * 80 = 0 for me, leaving 2 units at 160)\n* Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 40 = 40 for me, leaving 1 unit at 40)\n* Item 5: 2 units (2 * 17 = 34 for me, leaving 1 unit at 17)\n\nThis gives Player 2 a value of: 1*50 + 1*64 + 0*80 + 1*40 + 2*17 = 50 + 64 + 0 + 40 + 34 = 188\n\nMy value would be: 4*50 + 3*64 + 2*80 + 1*40 + 1*17 = 200 + 192 + 160 + 40 + 17 = 609\n\nThis seems better. My value of 609 is greater than my outside offer of 513. Now I am offering them 188, but this feels too low.\n\nA better approach would be:\n\n* Item 1: 2 unit (2 * 50 = 100 for me, leaving 3 units at 150)\n* Item 2: 1 unit (1 * 64 = 64 for me, leaving 3 units at 192)\n* Item 3: 0 unit (0 * 80 = 0 for me, leaving 2 units at 160)\n* Item 4: 0 unit (0 * 40 = 0 for me, leaving 2 units at 80)\n* Item 5: 1 unit (1 * 17 = 17 for me, leaving 2 units at 34)\n\nThis offer would give Player 2 a value of:\n2*50 + 1*64 + 0*80 + 0*40 + 1*17 = 100 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 17 = 181.\n\nMy value would be:\n3*50 + 3*64 + 2*80 + 2*40 + 2*17 = 150 + 192 + 160 + 80 + 34 = 616\n\nThis offer is reasonable as well. Let's choose this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

This means they are offering me 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* 2 units of item 1: 2 * 25 = 50\n* 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 64 = 64\n* 0 units of item 3: 0 * 28 = 0\n* 0 units of item 4: 0 * 33 = 0\n* 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 32 = 32\nTotal value of the offer: 50 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 32 = 146\n\nNow I compare this value to my outside offer, which is 249. Since 146 is less than 249, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nI need to decide whether to walk away, or make a counteroffer. Since this is the first round, there is a good amount of negotiation room. Let's consider what a fair division might look like. If we divide the items equally (as much as possible), I would get roughly half of the items:\n* Item 1: 2 or 3 units\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 1 unit\n* Item 4: 1 unit\n* Item 5: 1 or 2 units\n\nTo improve upon my outside option of 249 I need to obtain at least that value in an offer. Let's try an example counteroffer where I keep most of the higher value items and give the other agent what they've offered me plus some items they seem less interested in:\nCounteroffer (what I offer to Player 1): [3, 3, 1, 1, 2]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n* Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n* Item 2: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n* Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n* Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n* Item 5: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n\nThe value of this allocation to me is:\n* 2 * 25 = 50\n* 1 * 64 = 64\n* 1 * 28 = 28\n* 1 * 33 = 33\n* 1 * 32 = 32\nTotal Value: 50 + 64 + 28 + 33 + 32 = 207\n\nThis is still less than my walkaway value, however, perhaps Player 1 values the inverse items and this may make an equitable offer that they would find favorable so it is worth exploring this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I will take more item 4 and item 5, since my value for those are very high.\nOffer to player 1: [2, 3, 3, 0, 0]\nValue to me: 1*29 + 2*2 + 2*40 + 3*67 + 3*77 = 29+4+80+201+231 = 545.

I want to propose a split that's favorable to me but also has a chance of being accepted by Player 2. I'll start with an offer that gives Player 2 a decent amount, slightly above my outside offer. I need to estimate what constitutes a \"decent\" amount for Player 2, but without knowing their values, this is tricky. I'll aim for an offer that gives Player 2 about 65% of the total value.\n\nLet's allocate the following to Player 2:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 2 units\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 1 unit\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nMy value for this: (2 * 72) + (2 * 67) + (2 * 90) + (1 * 19) + (2 * 50) = 144 + 134 + 180 + 19 + 100 = 577\n\nPlayer 2's offer value: (2 * 72) + (1 * 67) + (1 * 90) + (2 * 19) + (2 * 50) = 144 + 67 + 90 + 38 + 100 = 439\n\nThis is too far off from my outside option.

However, it might be too skewed for Player 2 to accept. I need to increase the offer to Player 2.\n\nFinal Offer:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 1 unit\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 1 unit\nItem 5: 1 unit\n\nMy value: (3*72)+(2*67)+(2*90)+(2*19)+(3*50) = 216+134+180+38+150 = 718\nPlayer 2's value: (1*72)+(1*67)+(1*90)+(1*19)+(1*50) = 72+67+90+19+50 = 298\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

I want to maximize my value while making it attractive enough for Player 2 to accept. Since Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] in round 1, it seems like they value each item at least a little. I could try to offer them a little more and keep the items I value the most.\n\nLet's evaluate a few scenarios and consider a counteroffer. I will offer 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5. This will give me:\n\n* Item 1: 3 * 76 = 228\n* Item 2: 2 * 25 = 50\n* Item 3: 3 * 18 = 54\n* Item 4: 2 * 73 = 146\n* Item 5: 2 * 66 = 132\nTotal Value = 228+50+54+146+132=610. Discounted = 610 * 0.9 = 549\n\nIf the other agent accepts the offer it will be better than taking the outside option.\nNow let me consider offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 1].\nMy gain would be 610 with 0.9 discount, that is 549.\nSince 549 is greater than my outside option I will propose this.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

One reasonable assumption is that their values are also uniformly distributed between 1 and 101.

Value = 3 * 42 = 126\nTotal value = 276 + 0 + 87 + 114 + 126 = 603\n\nLet's try:\n\n- Item 1: I keep 4, offer 1. Value = 4 * 92 = 368\n- Item 2: I keep 0, offer 0. Value = 0\n- Item 3: I keep 5, offer 1. Value = 5 * 29 = 145\n- Item 4: I keep 3, offer 1. Value = 3 * 57 = 171\n- Item 5: I keep 5, offer 1. Value = 5 * 42 = 210\nTotal value = 368 + 0 + 145 + 171 + 210 = 894\n\nLet's be a bit more generous:\n- Item 1: I keep 3, offer 2. Value = 3 * 92 = 276\n- Item 2: I keep 0, offer 0.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 4, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 4, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Since 436 > 274, accepting the offer is better than walking away *right now*.

This means they want to give me 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of this offer to me:\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 35 = 105\n*   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 2 = 2\n*   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 100 = 100\n*   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 78 = 78\n*   4 units of item 5: 4 * 48 = 192\nTotal value of the offer: 105 + 2 + 100 + 78 + 192 = 477\n\nSince it is round 2, this value will be multiplied by the discount factor 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So the present value of the offer to me is 477 * 0.9 = 429.3\n\nMy outside offer is 507. Since 429.3 is less than 507, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a possible counteroffer. In round 1, I offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 3]. Player 2 countered with [3, 1, 1, 1, 4].\nI have 5-3 = 2 units of item 1, 3-1 = 2 units of item 2, 3-1 = 2 units of item 3, 3-1 = 2 units of item 4, and 6-4 = 2 units of item 5 left to keep if I accept their last offer.\n\nLet's aim for a split that gives me a value closer to my outside offer. I need to give Player 2:\n\nItem 1: Total 5. If I give them 2, I keep 3. Value: 3 * 35 = 105\nItem 2: Total 3. If I give them 1, I keep 2. Value: 2 * 2 = 4\nItem 3: Total 3. If I give them 1, I keep 2. Value: 2 * 100 = 200\nItem 4: Total 3. If I give them 1, I keep 2. Value: 2 * 78 = 156\nItem 5: Total 6. If I give them 4, I keep 2. Value: 2 * 48 = 96\nTotal value for me: 105 + 4 + 200 + 156 + 96 = 561.\n\nIf I give Player 2 1 less of item 5, I keep 3:\nItem 5: Total 6. If I give them 3, I keep 3. Value: 3 * 48 = 144\nTotal value for me: 105 + 4 + 200 + 156 + 144 = 609\n\nSo, let me try offering Player 2 [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]. This means I would keep 3 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\nMy value would be: 3*35 + 2*2 + 2*100 + 2*78 + 3*48 = 105 + 4 + 200 + 156 + 144 = 609.\nThe discounted value in this round is 609 * 0.9 = 548.1\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]}\n```",

Let's calculate the value of giving Player 2 half the items (rounding where necessary):\n- Item 1: 3 units to Player 2 (leaving me with 4)\n- Item 2: 2 units to Player 2 (leaving me with 3)\n- Item 3: 4 units to Player 2 (leaving me with 4)\n- Item 4: 1 unit to Player 2 (leaving me with 2)\n- Item 5: 3 units to Player 2 (leaving me with 3)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n- 4 * 38 = 152\n- 3 * 32 = 96\n- 4 * 18 = 72\n- 2 * 5 = 10\n- 3 * 46 = 138\nTotal value = 152 + 96 + 72 + 10 + 138 = 468\n\nSince 468 is greater than my outside offer of 435, this seems like a reasonable starting point. I'll offer this split to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 4, 1, 3]}\n```",

Since their value might differ widely, I will aim for an offer to give Player 2 at least half the total value, but make sure it's not too costly for me.\n\nLet's construct an offer to Player 2, giving them approximately half of each item, if feasible:\n*   Item 1: 1 unit\n*   Item 2: 3 units\n*   Item 3: 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 3 units\n*   Item 5: 0 units\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 1 unit * 69 = 69\n* Item 2: 3 units * 6 = 18\n* Item 3: 1 unit * 19 = 19\n* Item 4: 4 units * 64 = 256\n* Item 5: 1 unit * 75 = 75\nTotal = 69 + 18 + 19 + 256 + 75 = 437\n\nThis is much lower than my outside offer. \n\nLet me try instead offer Player 2 a lower offer:\n*   Item 1: 0 unit\n*   Item 2: 3 units\n*   Item 3: 0 unit\n*   Item 4: 3 units\n*   Item 5: 0 units\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 2 unit * 69 = 138\n* Item 2: 3 units * 6 = 18\n* Item 3: 2 unit * 19 = 38\n* Item 4: 4 units * 64 = 256\n* Item 5: 1 unit * 75 = 75\nTotal = 138 + 18 + 38 + 256 + 75 = 525\n\nThis is still below my outside offer.

I want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted, or at least lead to a deal within the three rounds, while still being favorable to me.

Therefore, I will try to keep the items that I value higher and offer them the items that I value lower in such a way that it exceeds their outside offer.\n\nLet's start by offering them half of all items and see if it is beneficial for me or not.\n\nItem 1: 1.5 units (keeping 1.5), value = 1.5 * 92 = 138\nItem 2: 2.5 units (keeping 2.5), value = 2.5 * 52 = 130\nItem 3: 2 units (keeping 2), value = 2 * 64 = 128\nItem 4: 2 units (keeping 2), value = 2 * 55 = 110\nItem 5: 1.5 units (keeping 1.5), value = 1.5 * 100 = 150\n\nTotal value = 138 + 130 + 128 + 110 + 150 = 656\n\nIf I give them these items, I get a value of 656. Clearly, this is not enough as my outside offer is way higher.\n\nTo reach my outside offer of 1064, I will try to keep the most valuable item with me as much as possible. Item 5 has a value of 100 per unit, so I will keep all of Item 5.\n\nItem 1: 0 units (keeping 3), value = 3 * 92 = 276\nItem 2: 0 units (keeping 5), value = 5 * 52 = 260\nItem 3: 0 units (keeping 4), value = 4 * 64 = 256\nItem 4: 0 units (keeping 4), value = 4 * 55 = 220\nItem 5: 0 units (keeping 3), value = 3 * 100 = 300\n\nTotal value = 276 + 260 + 256 + 220 + 300 = 1312\n\nIn this case, my total value is 1312, which is higher than my outside offer, and I am offering them 0. I will offer them a little of each item. I will give them one unit of Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3, and let's see the result.\n\nItem 1: 1 unit, value = 2 * 92 = 184\nItem 2: 1 unit, value = 4 * 52 = 208\nItem 3: 1 unit, value = 3 * 64 = 192\nItem 4: 0 unit, value = 4 * 55 = 220\nItem 5: 0 unit, value = 3 * 100 = 300\n\nTotal value = 184 + 208 + 192 + 220 + 300 = 1104\n\nNow, if I give Player 2,\n\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 3\n\nLet's see how much it would be to give Player 2 these items:\n\nItem 1: 92\nItem 2: 52\nItem 3: 64\nItem 4: 220\nItem 5: 300\n\nTotal value = 92 + 52 + 64 + 220 + 300 = 728. Let's reduce Item 4 by 1 and give them 3.\n\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 3\n\nItem 1: 92\nItem 2: 52\nItem 3: 64\nItem 4: 165\nItem 5: 300\n\nTotal value = 92 + 52 + 64 + 165 + 300 = 673\n\nSo, if I give Player 2 (1, 1, 1, 3, 3), my value is:\n\nItem 1: 2, value = 2 * 92 = 184\nItem 2: 4, value = 4 * 52 = 208\nItem 3: 3, value = 3 * 64 = 192\nItem 4: 1, value = 1 * 55 = 55\nItem 5: 0, value = 0 * 100 = 0\n\nTotal value = 184 + 208 + 192 + 55 + 0 = 639\n\nNot high enough.\n\nI'll try offering Player 2 one unit of each item: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nMy value then becomes:\n\nItem 1: 2, value = 184\nItem 2: 4, value = 208\nItem 3: 3, value = 192\nItem 4: 3, value = 165\nItem 5: 2, value = 200\nTotal: 949\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 1064.\n\nTherefore, my strategy will be to keep as much of my high value items as possible, while still providing a decent offer to Player 2. Since I'm not sure what Player 2 values more, I will offer them [0, 1, 1, 2, 0].\n\nThis gives me:\nItem 1: 3, value = 276\nItem 2: 4, value = 208\nItem 3: 3, value = 192\nItem 4: 2, value = 110\nItem 5: 3, value = 300\nTotal: 1086\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]}\n",

My private values are 92, 52, 64, 55, 100 for items 1 through 5, respectively. My outside offer is 1064. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I calculate the value of the current offer:\n(1 * 92) + (3 * 52) + (2 * 64) + (2 * 55) + (1 * 100) = 92 + 156 + 128 + 110 + 100 = 586.\n\nSince it is round 2, the discounted value of this offer is 586 * 0.9^(2-1) = 586 * 0.9 = 527.4.\n\nThis is significantly lower than my outside offer of 1064. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. If I walk away, I get 1064. If I make a counteroffer and it is accepted, I get some value discounted by 0.9. To make a reasonable counteroffer, I should aim to get a deal better than my outside offer *after* applying the discount. So I want to obtain at least (1064 / 0.9) = 1182.22 value from a potential deal in round 2. Let's try to structure a deal to achieve this.\n\nI have a total value of 1312.\n\nLet's consider a very greedy counteroffer that gives Player 2 almost nothing. Suppose I offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything. My value would be 1312, and the discounted value would be 1312 * 0.9 = 1180.8, this is still lower than my outside offer, which means if it's the last round I am better off walking away, so player 2 can always just walk away after my offer of [0,0,0,0,0]. Therefore, this is a bad offer.\n\nLet's think about a more fair offer, which is to make it as close to equally beneficial to both sides as possible.\n\nPlayer 2 has proposed [1, 3, 2, 2, 1], which I calculated to be worth 527.4 *after* discount to me. This means I am giving Player 2 a higher value offer.\n\nLet's make an offer that at least gives me my outside offer, and see where that leads.\nI have 3, 5, 4, 4, 3 of items 1-5 respectively. My values are 92, 52, 64, 55, 100 for items 1 through 5, respectively.\nLet's try and offer Player 2 an amount that equals (1312 - 1182.22), which I keep. This equals 129.78.\nLet's allocate item 2 to Player 2 so that the value is as close to 129.78 as possible.\n129.78 / 52 = 2.49. Let's offer Player 2 2 units of item 2, so that the value is 2 * 52 = 104. Now I need to give 129.78 - 104 = 25.78. Let's give 1 unit of item 4 which is value 55. It is greater than the amount of value I need to give to Player 2, so I should offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. This will give me a total value of (3 * 92) + (3 * 52) + (4 * 64) + (4 * 55) + (3 * 100) = 276 + 156 + 256 + 220 + 300 = 1208, after discount this is 1087.2. It is higher than my outside offer of 1064, so a slight improvement.\n\nLet me offer the following to Player 2: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

I could make an offer that gives Player 1 almost everything of what they want the most of, and keep what I value the most.

So, a possible counteroffer could be to give away all of item 2 and keep item 4 and item 5.\n\nLet's propose the counteroffer [3, 5, 4, 0, 0].

The counteroffer would be [3,5,4,0,2].\n\nMy valuation is:\n(0 * 42) + (0 * 30) + (0 * 17) + (4 * 76) + (1 * 97) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 304 + 97 = 401\nThe discounted value is 401 * 0.9 = 360.9.\nSince 360.9 > 338, this is better than walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 5, 4, 0, 2]}\n```",

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, considering my outside offer of 493.\n\nHere's my valuation of the items:\n- Item 1: 57 (5 units available)\n- Item 2: 50 (4 units available)\n- Item 3: 87 (2 units available)\n- Item 4: 24 (5 units available)\n- Item 5: 11 (4 units available)\n\nMy total value for all items is 823.\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's values, a reasonable strategy is to aim for an even split in terms of *perceived* value. I want an offer that, if accepted, gives me more than my outside option after considering the discount factor in later rounds. I should also consider what an \"even split\" means with different numbers of items.\n\nI will start with trying to take more units of Items I value more (1, 2, 3) and offering more units of Items I value less to Player 2 (4, 5). An even split of items might be an easy offer to start with. It also allows me to evaluate Player 2's response to a simple starting point. Let's consider the \"even\" split of each item (rounding down where not possible). I will need to calculate what values I get from keeping the rest of each item for myself:\n\nGive Player 2:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 2\n\nKeep:\n- Item 1: 3 -> 3 * 57 = 171\n- Item 2: 2 -> 2 * 50 = 100\n- Item 3: 1 -> 1 * 87 = 87\n- Item 4: 3 -> 3 * 24 = 72\n- Item 5: 2 -> 2 * 11 = 22\n\nTotal value to me = 171 + 100 + 87 + 72 + 22 = 452\n\nSince this is less than my outside option of 493, I will try to be a bit more aggressive and keep more of my valuable items. Let's adjust the offer to give Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 3\n\nKeep:\n- Item 1: 4 -> 4 * 57 = 228\n- Item 2: 3 -> 3 * 50 = 150\n- Item 3: 2 -> 2 * 87 = 174\n- Item 4: 2 -> 2 * 24 = 48\n- Item 5: 1 -> 1 * 11 = 11\n\nTotal value to me = 228 + 150 + 174 + 48 + 11 = 611\n\nThis looks better and above the outside offer, even if discounted.

Since I don't know their values, I'll start by offering them roughly half the items.\n\nHere's a possible offer:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 0 units\n*   Item 3: 3 units\n*   Item 4: 4 units\n*   Item 5: 0 units\n\nThis means I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 4 units\n*   Item 4: 4 units\n*   Item 5: 1 unit\n\nLet's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 * 47 = 94\n*   Item 2: 1 * 56 = 56\n*   Item 3: 4 * 96 = 384\n*   Item 4: 4 * 12 = 48\n*   Item 5: 1 * 74 = 74\n\nTotal value to me: 94 + 56 + 384 + 48 + 74 = 656\n\nSince 656 > 618 (my outside offer), this is a better outcome than walking away, even if player 2 accepts this in the current round. This is a reasonable starting offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 3, 4, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 2. The current offer on the table from Player 1 is [2, 0, 3, 4, 0], which means Player 1 is offering me 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My private values are 28 for item 1, 16 for item 2, 3 for item 3, 83 for item 4, and 89 for item 5. My outside offer is 800.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 28 = 56\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 * 16 = 0\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 3 = 9\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 * 83 = 332\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 * 89 = 0\nTotal value of current offer: 56 + 0 + 9 + 332 + 0 = 397\n\nSince 397 is less than my outside offer of 800, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. If I make a counteroffer, it's round 1, so the discount factor doesn't matter yet. If I walk away, I get 800. I need to consider what a reasonable counteroffer would be, and what Player 1's possible values are.\n\nSince this is round 1, and I have a strong outside offer, I will make a counteroffer that gives me a large portion of the items, but still provides Player 1 with some value. I will give player 1: 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5. This means I keep: 3 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5.\n\nValue of my counteroffer to me if accepted:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 * 28 = 84\n- 1 units of item 2: 1 * 16 = 16\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 * 3 = 12\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 * 83 = 415\n- 1 units of item 5: 1 * 89 = 89\nTotal value: 84 + 16 + 12 + 415 + 89 = 616\n\nThis still isn't as high as my outside offer, so I need to be more aggressive. Let's try offering player 1: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n\nThat would leave me with: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\nValue of this counteroffer to me:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 * 28 = 112\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 16 = 16\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 3 = 9\n- 6 units of item 4: 6 * 83 = 498\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 89 = 89\nTotal Value: 112 + 16 + 9 + 498 + 89 = 724\n\nStill less than my outside offer. So let's be as aggressive as possible while giving player 1 something to accept. Let's offer player 1: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\nThis leaves me with: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 7 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\nValue of this counteroffer: 4*28 + 1*16 + 1*3 + 7*83 + 1*89 = 112 + 16 + 3 + 581 + 89 = 801\n\nSince 801 is slightly better than my outside option and gives the other player something, I will use this as my counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 6, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1294. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 993 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm Player 1, and I want to maximize my outcome, considering my private values and outside offer.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 85 (3 units)\n- Item 2: 86 (8 units)\n- Item 3: 90 (4 units)\n- Item 4: 39 (4 units)\n- Item 5: 31 (3 units)\nMy outside offer is 1294.\n\nSince it's the first round and there's no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. My strategy is to make an offer that gives Player 2 a decent amount while still ensuring I get more than my outside offer *if* they accept it. I will aim to get at least half of the value of items 1, 2, and 3, while giving most of items 4 and 5 away.\n\nLet's start with an offer where I keep:\n- Item 1: 2 units  (2 * 85 = 170)\n- Item 2: 5 units  (5 * 86 = 430)\n- Item 3: 2 units  (2 * 90 = 180)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (1* 39 = 39)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (1*31 = 31)\nTotal value to me: 170 + 430 + 180 + 39 + 31 = 850. This is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet me adjust my counteroffer. I want to get more of the items I value highly. I will offer:\n- Item 1: 1 units (leaving me with 2, worth 170)\n- Item 2: 4 units (leaving me with 4, worth 344)\n- Item 3: 2 units (leaving me with 2, worth 180)\n- Item 4: 3 units (leaving me with 1, worth 39)\n- Item 5: 2 units (leaving me with 1, worth 31)\n\nTotal value to me: 170 + 344 + 180 + 39 + 31 = 764.  Still less than my outside option.\n\nOkay, another adjustment. I'll try to be more aggressive.\n\n- Item 1: 0 units (leaving me with 3, worth 255)\n- Item 2: 3 units (leaving me with 5, worth 430)\n- Item 3: 1 units (leaving me with 3, worth 270)\n- Item 4: 3 units (leaving me with 1, worth 39)\n- Item 5: 2 units (leaving me with 1, worth 31)\n\nTotal value: 255 + 430 + 270 + 39 + 31 = 1025. Still a little low.\n\nOne more try. I think I should focus on getting a larger share of item 3:\n\n- Item 1: 0 units (leaving me with 3, worth 255)\n- Item 2: 3 units (leaving me with 5, worth 430)\n- Item 3: 0 units (leaving me with 4, worth 360)\n- Item 4: 3 units (leaving me with 1, worth 39)\n- Item 5: 2 units (leaving me with 1, worth 31)\n\nTotal value: 255 + 430 + 360 + 39 + 31 = 1115\n\nI am still below my outside offer, so let's re-adjust one more time.\n- Item 1: 0 units (leaving me with 3, worth 255)\n- Item 2: 2 units (leaving me with 6, worth 516)\n- Item 3: 0 units (leaving me with 4, worth 360)\n- Item 4: 3 units (leaving me with 1, worth 39)\n- Item 5: 2 units (leaving me with 1, worth 31)\nTotal Value: 255 + 516 + 360 + 39 + 31 = 1201\n\nOkay, let's try:\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 2\n\nMy value: 3*85 + 7*86 + 4*90 + 1*39 + 1*31 = 255 + 602 + 360 + 39 + 31 = 1287\n\nOkay, I need to be slightly more greedy. I will offer the following:\n\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 0 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 4, 3]}\n```",

This will depend on Player 2's valuations, which I don't know, but I'll try to make my offer appealing enough that they are likely to counteroffer instead of walking away.\n\nMy total value for all items is (4 * 48) + (0 * 53) + (3 * 23) + (6 * 74) + (5 * 85) = 192 + 0 + 69 + 444 + 425 = 1130.\n\nLet's start by giving half of each item to Player 2, rounded down where necessary. That would be:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 0 units\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 3 units\nItem 5: 2 units\nMy value in this case would be: (2*48) + (0*53) + (2*23) + (3*74) + (3*85) = 96 + 0 + 46 + 222 + 255 = 619.\nSince 619 > 588, this is better than walking away.\n\nLet's offer the other player slightly more to see if they are likely to accept it.\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 0 units\nItem 3: 2 unit\nItem 4: 4 units\nItem 5: 3 units\nMy value in this case would be: (2*48) + (0*53) + (1*23) + (2*74) + (2*85) = 96 + 0 + 23 + 148 + 170 = 437.\nThis is less than my outside offer, so it's not a good offer to propose.\n\nI will go with my initial offer of giving approximately half the items, to give myself the best chances of receiving a counteroffer from Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

I need to decide on an offer that is likely to be accepted, or at least lead to a counteroffer that I can accept in a later round with the discount factor. The key here is to make a reasonable offer now and avoid walking away immediately.\n\nI don't know Player 2's values, but I can assume they are also trying to maximize their value. A simple strategy is to offer Player 2 half of each item. However, it is better to keep a little more for myself of the items that I value more, and give Player 2 more of the items that I value less. Let's try this approach to see what it looks like.\n- Item 1: Give Player 2 2, Keep 2: 2 * 96 = 192 (Keeping)\n- Item 2: Give Player 2 3, Keep 2: 2 * 54 = 108 (Keeping)\n- Item 3: Give Player 2 1, Keep 1: 1 * 76 = 76 (Keeping)\n- Item 4: Give Player 2 1, Keep 1: 1 * 67 = 67 (Keeping)\n- Item 5: Give Player 2 2, Keep 1: 1 * 52 = 52 (Keeping)\n\nTotal Value = 192 + 108 + 76 + 67 + 52 = 495.\n\nThis value is way below my outside offer of 626. So, I can't accept it as is if Player 2 gives me this.\nNow, let's make an offer where I keep most of the items 1 and 3, as those are the ones I value the most.\n- Item 1: Give Player 2 1, Keep 3: 3 * 96 = 288 (Keeping)\n- Item 2: Give Player 2 2, Keep 3: 3 * 54 = 162 (Keeping)\n- Item 3: Give Player 2 0, Keep 2: 2 * 76 = 152 (Keeping)\n- Item 4: Give Player 2 0, Keep 2: 2 * 67 = 134 (Keeping)\n- Item 5: Give Player 2 1, Keep 2: 2 * 52 = 104 (Keeping)\n\nTotal Value = 288 + 162 + 152 + 134 + 104 = 840\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer value of 626.

Giving away 0.\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 * 99 = 198\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 79 = 158\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 97 = 194\nTotal value I keep is 134 + 4 + 198 + 158 + 194 = 688.\n\nNow, this total value (688) is already significantly above my outside option (329). So I can adjust the offer to be less generous to player 2.\nOffer Player 2:\n- 1 units of item 1: 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3: 2\n- 4 units of item 4: 4\n- 2 units of item 5: 2\n\nKeeping:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 67 = 134\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 4 = 4.\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 * 99 = 198\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 * 79 = 158\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 97 = 194\nTotal value I keep is 134 + 4 + 198 + 158 + 194 = 688. This is greater than my outside option, but I think I can still adjust it further.\n\nOffer Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3: 0\n- 3 units of item 4: 3\n- 1 units of item 5: 1\n\nKeeping:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 * 67 = 201\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 4 = 4.\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 * 99 = 396\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 * 79 = 237\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 * 97 = 291\nTotal value I keep is 201 + 4 + 396 + 237 + 291 = 1129. This is high, and I think I can adjust it further.\n\nOffer Player 2:\n- 1 units of item 1: 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 units of item 3: 1\n- 3 units of item 4: 3\n- 1 units of item 5: 1\n\nKeeping:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 67 = 134\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 4 = 4.\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 99 = 297\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 * 79 = 237\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 * 97 = 291\nTotal value I keep is 134 + 4 + 297 + 237 + 291 = 963.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n**Round 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 offers me 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This means Player 1 gets the remaining units.\n\n*   **My Values:** My values per unit are: item 1 (7), item 2 (47), item 3 (100), item 4 (75), item 5 (59).\n\n*   **Calculating the Value of the Current Offer to Me:**\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 7 = 7\n    *   0 units of item 2: 0 * 47 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 100 = 200\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 75 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 59 = 118\n    *   Total value: 7 + 0 + 200 + 0 + 118 = 325\n\n*   **My Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 838.\n\n*   **Comparison:** The current offer (325) is significantly less than my outside offer (838). Therefore, accepting the current offer is not in my best interest.\n\n*   **Considering a Counteroffer:** I need to decide if there is a counteroffer that could be beneficial. Since it is round 1, I can make a counteroffer. The goal is to craft a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept, which gives me a value greater than 838 when discounted by 0.9 in later rounds. The total value of items I have is 1470. My discounted value after one round (round 2) would need to be at least 838/0.9 = 931.11.\n\n*   **Calculating my maximum possible outcome:**\n    *   5 units of item 1: 5 * 7 = 35\n    *   4 units of item 2: 4 * 47 = 188\n    *   7 units of item 3: 7 * 100 = 700\n    *   1 units of item 4: 1 * 75 = 75\n    *   8 units of item 5: 8 * 59 = 472\n    *   Total value: 35 + 188 + 700 + 75 + 472 = 1470\n\nLet's make a counteroffer that's somewhat aggressive but potentially acceptable. I need to leave player 1 with a reasonable amount while securing a better deal for myself. Let's try offering Player 1 approximately half of my total value, or 735. I will prioritize giving them items that I value less, and keeping items that I value more (item 3 especially).\n\nLet's try offering:\n*   Item 1: 3 units\n*   Item 2: 2 units\n*   Item 3: 3 units\n*   Item 4: 0 units\n*   Item 5: 3 units\n\nValue to Player 1 (assuming they value these items somewhat):\n*   Item 1: 3 * (likely > 7)\n*   Item 2: 2 * (likely > 47)\n*   Item 3: 3 * (likely > 100)\n*   Item 4: 0 * (likely > 75)\n*   Item 5: 3 * (likely > 59)\n\nTotal value for Player 1 would be at least 300.\n\nMy value if Player 1 accepts:\n*   Item 1: 2 * 7 = 14\n*   Item 2: 2 * 47 = 94\n*   Item 3: 4 * 100 = 400\n*   Item 4: 1 * 75 = 75\n*   Item 5: 5 * 59 = 295\n*   Total: 14 + 94 + 400 + 75 + 295 = 878\n\n878 > 838, and is a reasonable offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 3, 0, 3]}\n```",

I need a total value greater than 751.\n\nSince I have 8 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 in total, I can calculate the total possible value of all the items for myself:\n\nTotal Value = (8 * 67) + (9 * 27) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 63) + (2 * 71)\nTotal Value = 536 + 243 + 8 + 189 + 142 = 1118\n\nTo make a reasonable counteroffer, I should try to concede items that I value less and retain items I value more. I value item 3 the least, so I should give them both units. Player 1 offered 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. Let me make a counteroffer where I give them all 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5, 4 units of item 1 and 5 units of item 2.\n\nThen the items I have are : 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.\nValue = 4 * 67 + 4 * 27 + 0 * 4 + 1 * 63 + 1 * 71 = 268 + 108 + 0 + 63 + 71 = 510. Which is still less than 751. Let me give all of item 2 to them instead.\nThen the items I have are : 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.\nValue = 4 * 67 + 0 * 27 + 0 * 4 + 1 * 63 + 1 * 71 = 268 + 0 + 0 + 63 + 71 = 402.\n\nLet me give Player 1 all units of Items 2,3 and 4.\nMy value = 8 * 67 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 * 71 = 536 + 142 = 678\n\nLet me calculate the minimum amount of item 1 to make it worth accepting.\nLet x be number of items.\n67 * x + 71 * 2 >= 751\n67x >= 751 - 142 = 609\nx >= 609 / 67 = 9.09. So to accept, I need to get all item 1.\n\nSince the current offer of 470 is below my outside offer of 751, I should not accept. Instead, I will make a counteroffer.\nGiven my relatively high value for items 1 and 5, I want to retain as much of those as possible. I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a bit more on the other items.\n\nCounteroffer: [4, 5, 1, 2, 1]\nI give Player 1 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nThis leaves me with 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4 and 1 unit of item 5.\nMy value = 4 * 67 + 4 * 27 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 63 + 1 * 71 = 268 + 108 + 4 + 63 + 71 = 514\n\nThis is still less than 751, but it may be high enough to avoid a walk on the other agent's side.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 5, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

My goal is to maximize my expected payoff, considering the possibility of Player 2 accepting, counteroffering, or walking away.\n\nA good starting point is to consider a \"fair\" division based on equal split *in terms of total value*. To do that, I need to estimate the total value of items to Player 2. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I can make an assumption about these unknown values. Let's assume Player 2 has values that are close to mine. If I give half of each item to player 2, my payoff will be about half of my total valuation (877/2 = 438.5)\n\nHowever, my outside option is 178. A very conservative approach would be to offer just enough to incentivize the other player to accept something rather than walking away. Let's aim for a negotiation outcome where both players are better off than walking away. This means my payoff should be larger than 178, and the other player's payoff should be larger than their outside option (which I don't know).\n\nLet's start by making a slightly generous initial offer to see how the other player responds. I will offer the following:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units (2 * 67 = 134 to Player 2)\n*   Item 2: 4 units (4 * 42 = 168 to Player 2)\n*   Item 3: 1 unit (1 * 57 = 57 to Player 2)\n*   Item 4: 1 unit (1 * 21 = 21 to Player 2)\n*   Item 5: 2 units (2 * 10 = 20 to Player 2)\n\nThis offer values to 134 + 168 + 57 + 21 + 20 = 400 to the other player, and the total value of this offer to me is 877 - 400 = 477.\n\nThis is way better than my outside offer value of 178.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action. The current offer gives me the following:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units, value = 2 * 16 = 32\n*   Item 2: 4 units, value = 4 * 11 = 44\n*   Item 3: 1 unit, value = 1 * 25 = 25\n*   Item 4: 1 unit, value = 1 * 38 = 38\n*   Item 5: 2 units, value = 2 * 69 = 138\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 32 + 44 + 25 + 38 + 138 = 277\n\nSince 277 is greater than my outside offer of 136, accepting the offer would be better than walking away. Now let's consider if making a counteroffer would be even better.\n\nGiven that this is round 1, and there are 3 rounds, I should make a counteroffer if I think I can get a better deal in the subsequent rounds, considering the discount factor.\n\nMy total value for all items is 639. Player 1's offer gives me a value of 277. This implies Player 1 receives the following:\n\n*   Item 1: 5-2 = 3, Player 1 gets 3.\n*   Item 2: 8-4 = 4, Player 1 gets 4.\n*   Item 3: 2-1 = 1, Player 1 gets 1.\n*   Item 4: 2-1 = 1, Player 1 gets 1.\n*   Item 5: 5-2 = 3, Player 1 gets 3.\n\nI don't know Player 1's values. However, I can try to make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, but still attractive enough for Player 1 to potentially accept in the next round.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1:\n* Item 1: 3\n* Item 2: 4\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 2\n\nThis means I would get:\n*   Item 1: 2 units, value = 2 * 16 = 32\n*   Item 2: 4 units, value = 4 * 11 = 44\n*   Item 3: 2 unit, value = 2 * 25 = 50\n*   Item 4: 2 unit, value = 2 * 38 = 76\n*   Item 5: 3 units, value = 3 * 69 = 207\n\nTotal value: 32 + 44 + 50 + 76 + 207 = 409\n\nThis offer significantly increases my value to 409.

Item 3 has the highest value (83), followed by Items 1 and 4 (53), then Item 2 (43), and finally Item 5 (29).\n\nLet's start by considering what an even split would look like, rounded down for Player 2:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 2\n\nMy value for these items would be:\n(7-3)*53 + (7-3)*43 + (6-3)*83 + (7-3)*53 + (4-2)*29\n= 4*53 + 4*43 + 3*83 + 4*53 + 2*29\n= 212 + 172 + 249 + 212 + 58\n= 903\n\nThis leaves Player 2 with an offer of:\n3*53 + 3*43 + 3*83 + 3*53 + 2*29\n= 159 + 129 + 249 + 159 + 58\n= 754\n\nI need to get my total value higher than 1379 after discounting.

I'll offer:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 2\n\nMy value: (7-4)*53 + (7-4)*43 + (6-2)*83 + (7-4)*53 + (4-2)*29\n= 3*53 + 3*43 + 4*83 + 3*53 + 2*29\n= 159 + 129 + 332 + 159 + 58\n= 837\n\nPlayer 2's value: 4*53 + 4*43 + 2*83 + 4*53 + 2*29 = 212 + 172 + 166 + 212 + 58 = 820.\n\nStill doesn't meet my minimum requirement of 1379. Let's make Player 2 an even better offer at my own expense:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 5\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 2\n\nMy value: (7-4)*53 + (7-5)*43 + (6-3)*83 + (7-4)*53 + (4-2)*29\n= 3*53 + 2*43 + 3*83 + 3*53 + 2*29\n= 159 + 86 + 249 + 159 + 58\n= 711\n\nPlayer 2's value: 4*53 + 5*43 + 3*83 + 4*53 + 2*29 = 212 + 215 + 249 + 212 + 58 = 946.\n\nThis is much worse for me. Let's try another one that focuses on giving away Item 2 and Item 5:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 6\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 3\n\nMy value: (7-2)*53 + (7-6)*43 + (6-2)*83 + (7-2)*53 + (4-3)*29\n= 5*53 + 1*43 + 4*83 + 5*53 + 1*29\n= 265 + 43 + 332 + 265 + 29\n= 934\n\nPlayer 2's value: 2*53 + 6*43 + 2*83 + 2*53 + 3*29 = 106 + 258 + 166 + 106 + 87 = 723\n\nAll these offers are bad for me. It means I have to keep more of the items for myself, to get more value for the overall outcome.\n\nLet's try this offer:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 1\n\nMy value: (7-2)*53 + (7-2)*43 + (6-2)*83 + (7-2)*53 + (4-1)*29\n= 5*53 + 5*43 + 4*83 + 5*53 + 3*29\n= 265 + 215 + 332 + 265 + 87\n= 1164\n\nPlayer 2's value: 2*53 + 2*43 + 2*83 + 2*53 + 1*29 = 106 + 86 + 166 + 106 + 29 = 493\n\nOkay. That's closer. If I don't get a better offer in the next rounds, it will be discounted by 0.9 and 0.81.\n\nI am going to try a counteroffer that gives Player 2 a reasonable value:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 1\n\nMy value: (7-3)*53 + (7-3)*43 + (6-2)*83 + (7-3)*53 + (4-1)*29\n= 4*53 + 4*43 + 4*83 + 4*53 + 3*29\n= 212 + 172 + 332 + 212 + 87\n= 1015\n\nPlayer 2's value: 3*53 + 3*43 + 2*83 + 3*53 + 1*29 = 159 + 129 + 166 + 159 + 29 = 642.\n\nStill not high enough, I will try to improve it.\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 1\nMy value: (7-3)*53 + (7-4)*43 + (6-2)*83 + (7-3)*53 + (4-1)*29\n= 4*53 + 3*43 + 4*83 + 4*53 + 3*29\n= 212 + 129 + 332 + 212 + 87 = 972\n\nPlayer 2's value: 3*53 + 4*43 + 2*83 + 3*53 + 1*29 = 159 + 172 + 166 + 159 + 29 = 685.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 2, 3, 1]}\n```",

Since this is the first round, I should make an offer that gives me a good share of the items while also being appealing enough for Player 2 to accept, hopefully avoiding a walk.

Let's see how much that's worth to me:\n(2 * 3) + (3 * 81) + (8 * 27) + (7 * 20) + (6 * 15) = 6 + 243 + 216 + 140 + 90 = 695\n\nI can't possibly get more than 695. My outside offer is 593.\n\nLet's consider an offer that gives Player 2 a decent amount, but still leaves me with more than my outside offer. I'll start by giving Player 2 half of the total value, meaning I keep at least half of the total value.\n\nI need to offer something reasonable to Player 2. Let's aim for a split where I get a value slightly above my outside offer. Let's target giving them about 100 - 200 value. This is a starting point for negotiation.\n\nLet's try giving Player 2:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 2\n\nThis gives Player 2 a value of:\n(1 * 3) + (1 * 81) + (3 * 27) + (3 * 20) + (2 * 15) = 3 + 81 + 81 + 60 + 30 = 255\n\nThis is a pretty good starting point for Player 2.

I think it would be better to move around Item 2, since that has a high value to me.\n\nLet's try giving Player 2:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 3\n\nThis gives Player 2 a value of:\n(1 * 3) + (0 * 81) + (4 * 27) + (3 * 20) + (3 * 15) = 3 + 0 + 108 + 60 + 45 = 216\n\nThis is still reasonable for Player 2.\nNow let's see what's left for me:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 3\n\nMy value is:\n(1 * 3) + (3 * 81) + (4 * 27) + (4 * 20) + (3 * 15) = 3 + 243 + 108 + 80 + 45 = 479\n\nThis is still below my outside offer. I will offer a much smaller share of the items to Player 2.\nLet's try giving Player 2:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2\n\nThis gives Player 2 a value of:\n(0 * 3) + (0 * 81) + (2 * 27) + (2 * 20) + (2 * 15) = 0 + 0 + 54 + 40 + 30 = 124\n\nThis is a low offer.\nNow let's see what's left for me:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 6\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 4\n\nMy value is:\n(2 * 3) + (3 * 81) + (6 * 27) + (5 * 20) + (4 * 15) = 6 + 243 + 162 + 100 + 60 = 571\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer. Let's try giving even less to Player 2.\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nThis gives Player 2 a value of:\n(0 * 3) + (0 * 81) + (1 * 27) + (1 * 20) + (1 * 15) = 0 + 0 + 27 + 20 + 15 = 62\n\nThis is a very low offer.\nNow let's see what's left for me:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 7\nItem 4: 6\nItem 5: 5\n\nMy value is:\n(2 * 3) + (3 * 81) + (7 * 27) + (6 * 20) + (5 * 15) = 6 + 243 + 189 + 120 + 75 = 633\n\nOkay, this offer gives me a value higher than my outside offer.

I have a few things to consider: I have a total value of 1844, so Player 1 probably has a high total value as well. I want to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside option (1022), and hopefully better for Player 1 than their outside option.\n\nLet's start with an offer that's roughly a 50/50 split, which could give me close to my total value. To do this I can give the other player a reasonable amount of each item and retain a good amount for myself.\n\nSo, let's try offering Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThat leaves me with:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this outcome would be:\n(1 * 97) + (2 * 69) + (4 * 85) + (4 * 73) + (3 * 42) = 97 + 138 + 340 + 292 + 126 = 993\n\nSince 993 is less than my outside offer of 1022, this isn't a good offer for me to make.\n\nWhat about this:\nOffering Player 1:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThat leaves me with:\n- 2 unit of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 8 units of item 3\n- 7 units of item 4\n- 6 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this outcome would be:\n(2 * 97) + (3 * 69) + (8 * 85) + (7 * 73) + (6 * 42) = 194 + 207 + 680 + 511 + 252 = 1844\n\nI'm going to try making a slightly more generous offer. Maybe the player will accept.\nOffering Player 1:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThat leaves me with:\n- 2 unit of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 6 units of item 3\n- 5 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this outcome would be:\n(2 * 97) + (2 * 69) + (6 * 85) + (5 * 73) + (4 * 42) = 194 + 138 + 510 + 365 + 168 = 1375\n\nSince 1375 is more than 1022, this is okay.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are:\n- Item 1: 47\n- Item 2: 19\n- Item 3: 59\n- Item 4: 58\n- Item 5: 20\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 47) + (0 * 19) + (1 * 59) + (0 * 58) + (0 * 20) = 59\n\nMy outside offer is 881.\n\nSince 59 is significantly less than my outside offer of 881, I should not accept the current offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I have a total value of 925. I want to maximize my value while also giving Player 1 enough to make them accept. It's round 1, so there are two more rounds of negotiation. I need to consider the discount factor of 0.9 in future rounds.\n\nTo start, let's consider what a fair split might look like. If we split the total value in half, each player would receive 462.5. Given the relatively large gap between the value of receiving the current offer (59) and walking away (881), I will make a counteroffer that favors me heavily. The items that I value less might be more attractive to Player 1.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 slightly more than half of the items I don't value as much.\nOffer: [3, 2, 1, 3, 2]. This means I keep:\nItem 1: 6-3 = 3\nItem 2: 3-2 = 1\nItem 3: 4-1 = 3\nItem 4: 5-3 = 2\nItem 5: 3-2 = 1\n\nValue of this offer to me:\n(3 * 47) + (1 * 19) + (3 * 59) + (2 * 58) + (1 * 20) = 141 + 19 + 177 + 116 + 20 = 473\n\nSince 473 is significantly lower than my outside option, I will offer Player 1 something that provides me a value closer to my outside option.\n\nTo ensure I get a value exceeding my outside offer, I need to ensure I receive closer to 881/0.9 = ~979 if I'm making an offer in Round 2. So I will make a counteroffer assuming this will be the final round.\n\nLet me try an offer that gives Player 1 less:\nOffer: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nThen I keep:\nItem 1: 5\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 3\n\nMy Value: 5*47 + 3*19 + 4*59 + 4*58 + 3*20 = 235 + 57 + 236 + 232 + 60 = 820\n\nSince 820 < 881, I should not accept the offer and make a counteroffer. I will try an offer that yields me a value closer to my outside option value. Since I have a maximum value possible of 925, I'll try offering more to Player 1 such that I reach my outside offer value.\n\nOffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nValue to me: 6*47 + 3*19 + 4*59 + 5*58 + 3*20 = 282 + 57 + 236 + 290 + 60 = 925.\nSince 925 > 881, I will offer something to Player 1.\n\nOffer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nValue to me: (5*47) + (2*19) + (3*59) + (4*58) + (2*20) = 235 + 38 + 177 + 232 + 40 = 722\nThis is too low.\n\nOffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nValue to me: 925, this will be my baseline value.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer is [4, 2, 3, 1, 3], meaning I receive 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 37\n- Item 3: 14\n- Item 4: 54\n- Item 5: 72\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(4 * 1) + (2 * 37) + (3 * 14) + (1 * 54) + (3 * 72) = 4 + 74 + 42 + 54 + 216 = 390\n\nMy outside offer is 465. Since 390 is less than 465, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I want to keep as much of the items with high value to me as possible. Player 1 has offered me [4, 2, 3, 1, 3]. The total amounts available are [7, 5, 5, 4, 5]. Therefore, Player 1 would get [3, 3, 2, 3, 2] if I accept the current offer.\nThe maximum value I can get is 838 (the sum of the values of all items).\nI need to offer Player 1 something that they are likely to accept. If I offer Player 1 their current allocation plus a little bit more, they might accept.\nLet's try offering player 1 [4, 3, 3, 2, 3].\nThen I would get 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 1 = 3\n2 units of item 2 = 2 * 37 = 74\n2 units of item 3 = 2 * 14 = 28\n2 units of item 4 = 2 * 54 = 108\n2 units of item 5 = 2 * 72 = 144\nTotal value = 3 + 74 + 28 + 108 + 144 = 357\nSince this is less than my outside offer of 465, I won't propose this offer.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That gives me a value of 838, which is great! But Player 1 will definitely not accept.\nI should consider making a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 465.\nLet's try offering [4, 2, 3, 1, 0] to Player 1. Then I get [3, 3, 2, 3, 5]. My value is 3 + 3*37 + 2*14 + 3*54 + 5*72 = 3 + 111 + 28 + 162 + 360 = 664. This is greater than 465.\nIf instead, I offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], my value will be 838.\n\nNow let's make an offer that is better than my outside offer.\nWhat if I offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]?\nThen I get 6 + 4*37 + 4*14 + 3*54 + 4*72 = 6+148+56+162+288=660. This is better than 465.\n\nLet's try this offer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means Player 2 is offering me 1 unit of each item. I need to decide whether to accept this offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n1 unit of item 1: 1 * 50 = 50\n1 unit of item 2: 1 * 4 = 4\n1 unit of item 3: 1 * 40 = 40\n1 unit of item 4: 1 * 74 = 74\n1 unit of item 5: 1 * 38 = 38\nTotal value of current offer = 50 + 4 + 40 + 74 + 38 = 206\n\nSince this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of accepting the current offer is 206 * 0.9 = 185.4\n\nMy outside offer is 512. Since the present value of the current offer (185.4) is less than my outside offer (512), accepting is not a good idea.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to get at least my outside offer value, adjusted for the discount factor. So, I want to aim for a value of 512 / 0.9 = 568 (approximately) in round 1 terms (before discounting).\n\nI have a total of 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\nPlayer 2's offer leaves me with:\nItem 1: 7 - 1 = 6\nItem 2: 5 - 1 = 4\nItem 3: 5 - 1 = 4\nItem 4: 4 - 1 = 3\nItem 5: 5 - 1 = 4\n\nThe current offer for Player 2 is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

My values for these items are 1, 37, 14, 54, and 72. My outside offer is 465, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n* 3 units of item 1: 3 * 1 = 3\n* 2 units of item 2: 2 * 37 = 74\n* 2 units of item 3: 2 * 14 = 28\n* 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 54 = 54\n* 2 units of item 5: 2 * 72 = 144\nTotal value of the current offer: 3 + 74 + 28 + 54 + 144 = 303\n\nNow, let's apply the discount factor for round 2 (gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9):\nDiscounted value of the current offer: 303 * 0.9 = 272.7\n\nSince 272.7 is less than my outside offer of 465, accepting the current offer is not a good option.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. If I walk away, I get 465. If I make a counteroffer and Player 1 accepts, I need to get more than 465 / 0.9 = 516.67 in undiscounted value from the items I keep. If Player 1 rejects my counteroffer in round 2, because this is the final round where I can make a COUNTEROFFER, the game ends in a WALK.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I try to get at least my outside option. I have a total value of 838. This means Player 1 has the difference between this total value and my own. Let's aim for a deal close to splitting the value.\n\nI want to get around 517 after the discount, so I need a value of 517 / 0.9, which is around 574. The question becomes, can I craft a reasonable offer that would give me a value of 574?\nConsidering my high value for items 4 and 5, let's think about giving up more of items 1, 2, and 3. Let's start by seeing the value if I offer Player 1 half the items and adjust accordingly. Total items are 7, 5, 5, 4, and 5. Halves, respectively, would be 3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2, 2.5. Since we must use integers, we would be considering items 1-5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2.\n\nMy current offer is 3,2,2,1,2. Let's try to give a slightly worse deal to Player 1 and see if they accept.\n\nI'll try offering Player 1 4, 3, 3, 2, 3.\nMy remaining items would be 3, 2, 2, 2, 2. These have a value of:\n3*1 + 2*37 + 2*14 + 2*54 + 2*72 = 3 + 74 + 28 + 108 + 144 = 357\nThis is far below my outside offer, even with the discount removed.\n\nMy first counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] was weak. Let's think more strategically, focusing on keeping items 4 and 5.\n\nLet's keep 2 of item 4 (value 108) and 3 of item 5 (value 216). That's 324.\nI need another 574-324 = 250 in value. \nItem 2 at max quantity, 5, has a value of 5 * 37 = 185.\nWe are at 509, so we need approximately 65.\nTake the remaining 7 of item 1, which is not enough.\n\nThis is too complex.

This means they are keeping [1, 3, 1, 1, 2].\n\nLet's think about a counteroffer. I want to get as much of item 4 and item 5 as possible. Let's offer Player 1 [1, 3, 1, 0, 0].

I need to consider the discount factor if I counteroffer. If I get 438 in round 2, it will be 438 * 0.9 = 394.2. Since the value is still greater than current offer (250) , and better than my walkaway (22), a counteroffer would be profitable.\n\nLet's try to get more.\n\nLet's offer Player 1 [0, 3, 0, 0, 0] This leaves me with [2, 2, 2, 2, 3].\nValue = 2*28 + 2*30 + 2*29 + 2*78 + 3*55 = 56 + 60 + 58 + 156 + 165 = 495.\nThis is even better, and with the discount factor, it would still be 495 * 0.9 = 445.5. This remains more favorable than accepting the current offer of 250.\n\nGiven that it is Round 1 and I can potentially improve the offer, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

The goal is to propose an offer that Player 2 is likely to accept (or counter with a reasonable offer) while still securing a good value for myself. I need to estimate Player 2's values to some extent, but since they're drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 101, I can assume their values are centered around 51.\n\nTo start, I need to calculate the total value of all items to me:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 * 44 = 176\n*   Item 2: 6 * 22 = 132\n*   Item 3: 0 * 96 = 0\n*   Item 4: 1 * 71 = 71\n*   Item 5: 6 * 80 = 480\n*   Total Value = 176 + 132 + 0 + 71 + 480 = 859\n\nMy outside offer is 301.\n\nNow, I need to consider how to split the items to make an offer. I will aim for a roughly even split initially, adjusting to account for my higher values on certain items (Item 3, Item 4, Item 5). A perfectly fair split (50/50) could be a starting point, but since Player 2's values are unknown, I should offer them enough to incentivize them to accept. I want a deal that is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's start by proposing something slightly in my favor. I'll offer Player 2 roughly half of most items, maybe slightly more of the items I value less (1 and 2):\n\n*   Item 1: 2 to Player 2 (2 for me)\n*   Item 2: 3 to Player 2 (3 for me)\n*   Item 3: 0 to Player 2 (0 for me)\n*   Item 4: 0 to Player 2 (1 for me)\n*   Item 5: 3 to Player 2 (3 for me)\n\nMy value from this:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 * 44 = 88\n*   Item 2: 3 * 22 = 66\n*   Item 3: 0 * 96 = 0\n*   Item 4: 1 * 71 = 71\n*   Item 5: 3 * 80 = 240\n*   Total Value = 88 + 66 + 0 + 71 + 240 = 465\n\nThis gives me a value of 465.\n\nNow let's try another possible split. Maybe offer them a little more of the items I value less and keep the ones I value more.\n\n*   Item 1: 3 to Player 2 (1 for me)\n*   Item 2: 4 to Player 2 (2 for me)\n*   Item 3: 0 to Player 2 (0 for me)\n*   Item 4: 0 to Player 2 (1 for me)\n*   Item 5: 3 to Player 2 (3 for me)\n\nMy value from this:\n\n*   Item 1: 1 * 44 = 44\n*   Item 2: 2 * 22 = 44\n*   Item 3: 0 * 96 = 0\n*   Item 4: 1 * 71 = 71\n*   Item 5: 3 * 80 = 240\n*   Total Value = 44 + 44 + 0 + 71 + 240 = 399\n\nThis gives me a value of 399.\n\nIt seems reasonable to offer them items 1 and 2 in slightly larger proportions than I keep for myself. I'll go with the offer that gives me a value of 465 for now.\n\n**Action**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 0, 3]}\n```",

I'd keep all of item 1, item 3 and item 4.\nIn that case I will keep:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nValue:\n(4 * 97) + (0 * 88) + (0 * 13) + (1 * 21) + (0 * 6) = 388 + 0 + 0 + 21 + 0 = 409\n\nThis will mean offering player 1:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 6 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 6 units of item 5\n\nThis counteroffer is not better than my outside option.\n\nLet's try making a minimal counteroffer. I'll offer slightly more than the original offer to see if I can get a better deal without significantly reducing my value.\n\nI will keep:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nMy Value = 3 * 97 + 4 * 88 + 0 * 13 + 1 * 21 + 4 * 6 = 291 + 352 + 0 + 21 + 24 = 688\n\nI offer player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 2 unit of item 2\n- 0 unit of item 3\n- 0 unit of item 4\n- 2 unit of item 5\n\nSince 688 < 965, I will walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

The goal is to maximize my value, considering a discount factor of 0.9 and an outside offer of 1273.\n\nI need to decide on an initial offer to Player 2. A good starting point is to determine what division would give me a value equal to my outside offer. Then, I can adjust the offer to be slightly more favorable to me, anticipating that Player 2 will likely counteroffer.\n\nTotal items:\nItem 1: 4 units, value 3/unit\nItem 2: 5 units, value 63/unit\nItem 3: 4 units, value 93/unit\nItem 4: 6 units, value 24/unit\nItem 5: 8 units, value 63/unit\n\nMy total value for all items is (4 * 3) + (5 * 63) + (4 * 93) + (6 * 24) + (8 * 63) = 12 + 315 + 372 + 144 + 504 = 1347.\n\nI want to achieve a value close to my outside option. Let's try offering Player 2 half of the total value. If they accept, my gain will be smaller. Let's begin by offering 1 unit each. This will yield a small return for the round 1 offer.\nItem 1: Offer 1 to P2, keep 3. Value: 3 * 3 = 9\nItem 2: Offer 1 to P2, keep 4. Value: 4 * 63 = 252\nItem 3: Offer 1 to P2, keep 3. Value: 3 * 93 = 279\nItem 4: Offer 1 to P2, keep 5. Value: 5 * 24 = 120\nItem 5: Offer 1 to P2, keep 7. Value: 7 * 63 = 441\nTotal: 9 + 252 + 279 + 120 + 441 = 1101\n\nLet's aim for an offer that gives me closer to my outside option value if accepted. I'll give a lower amount of item 3 since I value it highly.\nItem 1: Give 1 unit to P2, keep 3. value = 3 * 3 = 9\nItem 2: Give 2 unit to P2, keep 3. value = 3 * 63 = 189\nItem 3: Give 0 unit to P2, keep 4. value = 4 * 93 = 372\nItem 4: Give 2 unit to P2, keep 4. value = 4 * 24 = 96\nItem 5: Give 3 unit to P2, keep 5. value = 5 * 63 = 315\nTotal value: 9 + 189 + 372 + 96 + 315 = 981\n\nLet's try another allocation closer to outside option\nItem 1: Offer 0 to Player 2, keep 4. Value: 4*3 = 12\nItem 2: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 4. Value: 4*63 = 252\nItem 3: Offer 0 to Player 2, keep 4. Value: 4*93 = 372\nItem 4: Offer 1 to Player 2, keep 5. Value: 5*24 = 120\nItem 5: Offer 3 to Player 2, keep 5. Value: 5*63 = 315\nTotal Value = 12 + 252 + 372 + 120 + 315 = 1071\n\nOkay, let's make a more generous offer to player 2.\nItem 1: Offer 1, keep 3. 3 * 3 = 9\nItem 2: Offer 1, keep 4. 4 * 63 = 252\nItem 3: Offer 1, keep 3. 3 * 93 = 279\nItem 4: Offer 2, keep 4. 4 * 24 = 96\nItem 5: Offer 4, keep 4. 4 * 63 = 252\n\nTotal: 9 + 252 + 279 + 96 + 252 = 888\n\nAfter a more complex calculation I decide that if I want to get the best possible value after round 1 I should try to offer player 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 4]}\n",

So, the discounted value of accepting is 1347 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 1347 * 0.9 = 1212.3.\n\nMy outside offer is 1273.

If I give away too much, my discounted value will be less than my outside offer.\nLet's make an initial guess and adjust from there. I'll start by offering Player 2 half the items, rounded down.

I need to give much less to Player 2. Let's try offering only 1 unit of item 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].\nValue to me:\nItem 1: 4 * 3 = 12\nItem 2: 5 * 63 = 315\nItem 3: 4 * 93 = 372\nItem 4: 6 * 24 = 144\nItem 5: (8-1) * 63 = 441\nTotal value = 12 + 315 + 372 + 144 + 441 = 1284\nDiscounted value = 1284 * 0.9 = 1155.6\n\nThat's still less than my outside offer. Okay, let's offer nothing: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which we know the discounted value of accepting to be less than 1273.\n\nLet's try to give away one unit of item 4, which has a lower value for me:\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nValue to me:\nItem 1: 4 * 3 = 12\nItem 2: 5 * 63 = 315\nItem 3: 4 * 93 = 372\nItem 4: (6-1) * 24 = 120\nItem 5: 8 * 63 = 504\nTotal Value: 1323\nDiscounted value: 1323 * 0.9 = 1190.7\n\nLet's try to give away only one of item 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nValue to me:\nItem 1: 3 * 3 = 9\nItem 2: 5 * 63 = 315\nItem 3: 4 * 93 = 372\nItem 4: 6 * 24 = 144\nItem 5: 8 * 63 = 504\nTotal Value: 1344\nDiscounted Value: 1344 * 0.9 = 1209.6\n\nI will WALK, because accepting yields 1212.3, my outside option gives me 1273, and my best counteroffer will still gives me less than 1273 in discounted value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I don't know Player 2's outside option, but I can try to gauge a reasonable share for Player 2. Let's start by offering Player 2 a relatively fair split of the items. I will start by giving player 2 half of all items.\n\nSo, the initial offer is: item 1: 3, item 2: 1, item 3: 0, item 4: 2, item 5: 3.

Since 487 > 106, accepting the offer is better than walking away *in the absence of discounting*.\n\nHowever, this is round 1. If negotiations fail now, I get 106. I need to consider if making a counteroffer could lead to a better outcome, discounted by 0.9 (gamma).\n\nLet's assume Player 1's values are roughly in the same range as mine (1-101). It seems likely they are getting good value from the offer too. Making a small counteroffer is unlikely to be accepted given that it's only round 1. It would need to be a fairly significant concession to prompt a deal. Given I would be discounting a potential deal in round 2 by 0.9, the expected gain has to offset the current loss to be worth the risk that P1 walks. Therefore, the risk of making a counteroffer seems too high.\n\nTherefore, the most rational choice is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by outlining my strategy. I need to consider my outside offer (559) and the potential value I can get from a negotiated agreement. Since I'm the first mover, I can make an initial offer that is favorable to me but still attractive enough for Player 2 to consider. I will aim for a division that yields me a value significantly higher than my outside offer, even after considering the discount factor in later rounds.\n\nGiven that this is round 1, I will start with an offer that gives Player 2 slightly more than half of the total possible value (based on a reasonable estimate of Player 2's values) while ensuring I get a substantial amount. To make this precise, I'll try to keep at least 1200 for myself if possible.\n\nHere's how I will approach formulating the counteroffer:\n\n1.  **Estimate Player 2's Values:** I'll assume their values are, on average, around 50 for each item unit (since the values are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101).\n\n2.  **Target Value for Player 2:** To make the deal attractive, I'll aim to give Player 2 a value of around 600 initially (more than my own outside offer).\n\n3.  **Calculate Offer:** Now, let's figure out how many units of each item I need to offer to Player 2 to reach that target value. Because my values are known, and I want to keep most of items that have high value to me such as item 1 and item 3, I will initially give all of item 2 and item 5.\n    *   Giving all of item 2 and item 5 to Player 2 means that my value calculation must consider that I will no longer have these units in the final round if I give them to Player 2.\n\n    *   **Item 2:** All 3 units\n    *   **Item 5:** All 2 units\n    * The remaining items are: 7 units of item 1, 10 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4.\n\n    I'll give 1 of Item 1, so my item 1 value calculation is: 1*96 = 96\n    I'll give 3 of Item 3, so my item 3 value calculation is: 3*78 = 234\n    I'll give 0 of Item 4, so my item 4 value calculation is: 0*82 = 0\n    I will keep the remaining units of item 1, item 3 and item 4 for myself.\n\n4. **Check My Value:** Now let's compute my value for the remaining items.\n    * 6 units of item 1 = 6 * 96 = 576\n    * 0 units of item 2 = 0 * 50 = 0\n    * 7 units of item 3 = 7 * 78 = 546\n    * 1 units of item 4 = 1 * 82 = 82\n    * 0 units of item 5 = 0 * 49 = 0\n    *Total Value = 576 + 0 + 546 + 82 + 0 = 1204\n\n    Total value from counteroffer = 96+234+0 = 330\n\n    Now I add 330 with a target item 2 and item 5.\n\n    I need to calculate the average estimated value of player 2 so I offer value close to 559\n    Estimated Value calculation for Item 2 to Player 2 = 3 * 50 = 150\n    Estimated Value calculation for Item 5 to Player 2 = 2 * 50 = 100\n    Value from giving player 2 Item 1 + Item 3 + Item 2 + Item 5 = 96 + 234 + 150 + 100 = 580\n\n    If I receive 1204, this is larger than the current outside offer of 559.\n\n5. **Adjust if Necessary:** If my value is below my outside offer, I will adjust the amounts to increase my share while still giving Player 2 enough to stay engaged.\n\nBased on these calculations, my counteroffer is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 2]}\n```\n",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 1, and I need to decide whether to WALK or make a COUNTEROFFER. I have 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. My private values are 27, 8, 3, 85, and 30, respectively. My outside offer is 427. The goal is to maximize my value, considering the discount factor of 0.9.\n\nSince this is the first round, there is no current offer. I need to propose an initial offer to Player 2. To do this, I need to consider what would be a reasonable offer that Player 2 might accept, while still leaving me with a value greater than my outside offer of 427.\n\nA fair starting point might be to split the items roughly in half, prioritizing giving Player 2 more of the items I value less and retaining more of the items I value highly.\n\nLet's consider the total value of all items:\n(5 * 27) + (4 * 8) + (0 * 3) + (2 * 85) + (5 * 30) = 135 + 32 + 0 + 170 + 150 = 487.\n\nI want to secure at least 427 after the discount factor in round 1. To estimate an initial offer, I'll aim for something that, if accepted, provides me with at least 427.\nLet's consider giving Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nThat would leave me with: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nMy value would then be: (3 * 27) + (2 * 8) + (0 * 3) + (1 * 85) + (3 * 30) = 81 + 16 + 0 + 85 + 90 = 272. This is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n\nLet's adjust this offer. I'll try offering Player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nThis would leave me with: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\nMy value now becomes: (4 * 27) + (3 * 8) + (0 * 3) + (2 * 85) + (4 * 30) = 108 + 24 + 0 + 170 + 120 = 422.\n\nThat's close, but still slightly below my outside offer. Let's try an even more conservative approach. I'll offer Player 2: 0 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nThis would leave me with: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\nMy value now becomes: (5 * 27) + (4 * 8) + (0 * 3) + (2 * 85) + (5 * 30) = 135 + 32 + 0 + 170 + 150 = 487.\n\nThis is greater than my outside option.

This means I would get:\n\n*   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n*   Item 3: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n*   Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1 units\n*   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n\n*   3 * 27 (Item 1) = 81\n*   2 * 8 (Item 2) = 16\n*   0 * 3 (Item 3) = 0\n*   1 * 85 (Item 4) = 85\n*   3 * 30 (Item 5) = 90\n\nTotal value = 81 + 16 + 0 + 85 + 90 = 272\n\nSince it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nSo, the present value of accepting this offer is 272 * 0.9 = 244.8.\n\nMy outside offer is 427. Since 244.8 is much less than 427, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my gain, but also make it appealing enough for Player 2 to accept. Let's try to find a deal that gives me at least my outside offer value, discounted by 0.9. That means I need at least 427/0.9 = 474.44.\n\nI value item 4 the most (85 per unit). Let me try to keep both units of item 4 for myself.\nAlso, since there are no item 3 units, let's not give player 2 any of it.\nI value items 1 and 5 at 27 and 30, respectively. Let me try to offer player 2 2 units of item 1 and 2 units of item 5.\nI value item 2 the least (8 per unit). I'll try to offer player 2 2 units of item 2.\n\nSo my counteroffer to Player 2 will be: [2, 2, 0, 0, 2]\nThis means I will get:\n*   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n*   Item 3: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n*   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n*   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n*   3 * 27 (Item 1) = 81\n*   2 * 8 (Item 2) = 16\n*   0 * 3 (Item 3) = 0\n*   2 * 85 (Item 4) = 170\n*   3 * 30 (Item 5) = 90\n\nTotal value = 81 + 16 + 0 + 170 + 90 = 357\n\nThis value, discounted to the present, is 357 * 0.9 = 321.3.\n\nLet's see if I can make an offer that gets me closer to my outside offer. Let's try to keep more items 4 and 5 and give player 2 more of the less valuable items 1 and 2.\nLet me try offering [3, 3, 0, 0, 3]\n\nThis means I will get:\n*   Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n*   Item 2: 4 - 3 = 1 units\n*   Item 3: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n*   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n*   Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n*   2 * 27 (Item 1) = 54\n*   1 * 8 (Item 2) = 8\n*   0 * 3 (Item 3) = 0\n*   2 * 85 (Item 4) = 170\n*   2 * 30 (Item 5) = 60\n\nTotal value = 54 + 8 + 0 + 170 + 60 = 292\nDiscounted = 292 * 0.9 = 262.8\n\nLet me try an offer that is somewhere in the middle. Offer [2, 3, 0, 0, 2]\n\nThis means I will get:\n*   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 4 - 3 = 1 units\n*   Item 3: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n*   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n*   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n*   3 * 27 (Item 1) = 81\n*   1 * 8 (Item 2) = 8\n*   0 * 3 (Item 3) = 0\n*   2 * 85 (Item 4) = 170\n*   3 * 30 (Item 5) = 90\n\nTotal value = 81 + 8 + 0 + 170 + 90 = 349\nDiscounted = 349 * 0.9 = 314.1\n\nLet's try to get more greedy and offer only [3, 3, 0, 1, 3] to player 2.\n\nThis means I will get:\n*   Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n*   Item 2: 4 - 3 = 1 units\n*   Item 3: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n*   Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1 units\n*   Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n*   2 * 27 (Item 1) = 54\n*   1 * 8 (Item 2) = 8\n*   0 * 3 (Item 3) = 0\n*   1 * 85 (Item 4) = 85\n*   2 * 30 (Item 5) = 60\n\nTotal value = 54 + 8 + 0 + 85 + 60 = 207\nDiscounted = 207 * 0.9 = 186.3\n\nGiven that this is round 2, I should make a counteroffer that is more likely to be accepted. I will offer [2, 3, 0, 0, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

Since 384.3 > 256, the current offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\n**Possible Scenarios:**\n\n*   **Accept:** I get a discounted value of 384.3\n*   **Walk:** I get 256.\n*   **Counteroffer:** This will be treated as a WALK in round 3, so I need to make sure any counteroffer now would lead to a result better than 256 in value to me for Player 2. Since there are no more rounds to negotiate a better offer, I would only make a counteroffer if I thought Player 1 would accept.\n\n**Counteroffer Considerations:**\n\nI want to find out what's the minimum amount I can offer that Player 1 would accept.\nLet's consider giving Player 1 everything. The total possible value to me is:\n(5 * 97) + (4 * 23) + (0 * 80) + (2 * 42) + (5 * 82) = 485 + 92 + 0 + 84 + 410 = 1071\nSo right now, my negotiation power is not very strong as Player 1 has most of the upper hand.\n\nLet's think about what would happen if I counteroffer something and it gets rejected. I would get 256.\nThe current offer is 384.3.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that my best option is to ACCEPT the current offer. Although I don't know Player 1's valuations, the risk of walking away with my outside offer is too high. Making a counteroffer and risking a walk in round 3 also has a very high risk, as the other player can choose to reject my offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I want to maximize my expected payoff, considering the possibility of reaching a deal in rounds 1, 2, or 3, or walking away with my outside offer. I should make an opening offer that is attractive enough for Player 2 to consider, but also leaves me with a substantial share of the items.\n\nMy private values are:\nItem 1: 41 (2 units available)\nItem 2: 96 (7 units available)\nItem 3: 46 (6 units available)\nItem 4: 26 (3 units available)\nItem 5: 29 (4 units available)\n\nMy outside offer: 1027\n\nI need to estimate what Player 2's values might be to create a reasonable offer. Since the values are drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 101, I'll assume Player 2 has an average value of 51 for each item.\n\nI want to make an offer where I get more of the items with higher value to me. So let's try offering a relatively small amount of my high-value items to Player 2 in exchange for giving me more of items that have less value to me, but are still available to be divided.\n\nI'll start with an offer where I give Player 2:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 3 units\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 1 unit\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 4 units\nItem 3: 4 units\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nMy value for this split is:\n1 * 41 + 4 * 96 + 4 * 46 + 2 * 26 + 2 * 29 = 41 + 384 + 184 + 52 + 58 = 719\n\nMy current offer to Player 2 is:\n1 * 41 + 3 * 96 + 2 * 46 + 1 * 26 + 2 * 29 = 41 + 288 + 92 + 26 + 58 = 505\n\nSince 719 is way below my outside offer of 1027, I need to adjust my offer. If I want player 2 to accept, I need to make the offer more favorable to them. Let's try a split where I get more of item 2 and item 3, as they are my higher value items.\n\nNew offer to Player 2:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 2 units\nItem 3: 1 units\nItem 4: 1 unit\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 5 units\nItem 3: 5 units\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 2 units\n\nMy value for this split is:\n1 * 41 + 5 * 96 + 5 * 46 + 2 * 26 + 2 * 29 = 41 + 480 + 230 + 52 + 58 = 861\n\nThe offer to Player 2 is:\n1 * 41 + 2 * 96 + 1 * 46 + 1 * 26 + 2 * 29 = 41 + 192 + 46 + 26 + 58 = 363\n\nStill below my outside offer.

I'm going to offer Player 2 half of my outside option (1027/2 = 513.5) as the value of the items I am offering.\nLet's try:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 4\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 2\nValue to Player 2: (1 * 51) + (4 * 51) + (2 * 51) + (1 * 51) + (2 * 51) = 51 + 204 + 102 + 51 + 102 = 510\nIf the value to Player 2 is 510, and my total value to all items is 1224, the minimum value to player 2 should be close to 510/1224 = .42 of total value.\nThis leaves me with (2-1), (7-4), (6-2), (3-1), (4-2), (1,3,4,2,2).  \nTherefore my total value is (1 * 41) + (3 * 96) + (4 * 46) + (2 * 26) + (2 * 29) = 41 + 288 + 184 + 52 + 58 = 623.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 is [1, 4, 2, 1, 2]. This means I would receive:\n* Item 1: 1 unit (2 total - 1 given to Player 1 = 1)\n* Item 2: 3 units (7 total - 4 given to Player 1 = 3)\n* Item 3: 4 units (6 total - 2 given to Player 1 = 4)\n* Item 4: 2 units (3 total - 1 given to Player 1 = 2)\n* Item 5: 2 units (4 total - 2 given to Player 1 = 2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* Item 1: 1 * 20 = 20\n* Item 2: 3 * 71 = 213\n* Item 3: 4 * 50 = 200\n* Item 4: 2 * 8 = 16\n* Item 5: 2 * 99 = 198\nTotal value = 20 + 213 + 200 + 16 + 198 = 647\n\nMy outside offer is 128. Since 647 > 128, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *if* this is the final round. However, it's only round 1, so I have to consider the discount factor and potential for a better offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my gain, so I want to give Player 1 the items I value least and keep the items I value most.\n\nSince I value Item 4 the least and Item 5 the most, I would prefer to keep Item 5. It might be beneficial to increase the amount of item 4 offered in exchange for decreasing the amount of Item 5. However, without knowing player 1's preferences, this could backfire. A safe counteroffer might be close to what they have offered.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 the following: [1, 4, 2, 1, 2]. This means that I would be essentially repeating the offer and seeing if they would take it. It would only be beneficial for me if they rejected it and I could negotiate more favorable terms later, but I am not sure what the logic of Player 1 is.\n\nThe current offer is pretty good at 647. With a discount factor of 0.9 in the next round, that means a value of 647 * 0.9 = 582.3. In round 3, the value would be 647 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 524.07. I think I should make a slightly more favorable counteroffer for them to consider.\n\nMy values are [20, 71, 50, 8, 99]. Player 1's first offer was [1, 4, 2, 1, 2], meaning I received [1, 3, 4, 2, 2].\n\nLet's try to keep the items I value higher and give the ones I value lower.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 3, 3, 2, 1] to Player 1. This means I would receive:\nItem 1: 1 unit (2 total - 1 given to Player 1 = 1)\nItem 2: 4 units (7 total - 3 given to Player 1 = 4)\nItem 3: 3 units (6 total - 3 given to Player 1 = 3)\nItem 4: 1 unit (3 total - 2 given to Player 1 = 1)\nItem 5: 3 units (4 total - 1 given to Player 1 = 3)\n\nValue: 1*20 + 4*71 + 3*50 + 1*8 + 3*99 = 20 + 284 + 150 + 8 + 297 = 759\n\nSince 759 > 647, I will offer [1, 3, 3, 2, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 3, 2, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and I need to decide whether to accept Player 2's offer, walk away, or make a counteroffer. My outside offer is worth 1027.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer on the table: [1, 3, 3, 2, 1]. This means Player 2 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.  I need to calculate the value of this offer to me, and then discount it back to the present. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nValue of the offer:\n* Item 1: 1 * 41 = 41\n* Item 2: 3 * 96 = 288\n* Item 3: 3 * 46 = 138\n* Item 4: 2 * 26 = 52\n* Item 5: 1 * 29 = 29\nTotal value: 41 + 288 + 138 + 52 + 29 = 548\n\nDiscounted value: 548 * 0.9 = 493.2\n\nSince 493.2 is much less than my outside offer of 1027, accepting is not a good option.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer something that Player 2 might accept, but also gives me more value than walking away.  Since it's round 2, I have a strong incentive to get a deal done. In my previous offer (Round 1), I offered [1, 4, 2, 1, 2] to Player 2. Player 2's offer was [1, 3, 3, 2, 1] to me.\n\nLet's try to find a midpoint or more favorable counteroffer. My values are heavily weighted towards item 2. Let's try offering the other player, Player 2, 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\nThis means I would receive:\n* Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2\n* Item 2: 7 - 4 = 3\n* Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3\n* Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n* Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nValue to me:\n* Item 1: 2 * 41 = 82\n* Item 2: 3 * 96 = 288\n* Item 3: 3 * 46 = 138\n* Item 4: 2 * 26 = 52\n* Item 5: 2 * 29 = 58\nTotal Value: 82 + 288 + 138 + 52 + 58 = 618\n\nDiscounted value: 618 * 0.9 = 556.2\n\nThis is still lower than my outside offer. Let's be more aggressive. Since it's round 2, and I want to avoid walking away, I should push the counteroffer to be more in my favor.\n\nLet's offer the other player, player 2, 0 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\nThis means I would receive:\n* Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2\n* Item 2: 7 - 5 = 2\n* Item 3: 6 - 4 = 2\n* Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1\n* Item 5: 4 - 3 = 1\nValue to me:\n* Item 1: 2 * 41 = 82\n* Item 2: 2 * 96 = 192\n* Item 3: 2 * 46 = 92\n* Item 4: 1 * 26 = 26\n* Item 5: 1 * 29 = 29\nTotal Value: 82 + 192 + 92 + 26 + 29 = 421\nDiscounted value: 421 * 0.9 = 378.9\n\nThis is also bad. It seems the only way to beat my outside offer is to take more of Item 2.\nLet's offer the other player, player 2, 0 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\nThis means I would receive:\n* Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2\n* Item 2: 7 - 1 = 6\n* Item 3: 6 - 1 = 5\n* Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3\n* Item 5: 4 - 0 = 4\nValue to me:\n* Item 1: 2 * 41 = 82\n* Item 2: 6 * 96 = 576\n* Item 3: 5 * 46 = 230\n* Item 4: 3 * 26 = 78\n* Item 5: 4 * 29 = 116\nTotal Value: 82 + 576 + 230 + 78 + 116 = 1082\nDiscounted value: 1082 * 0.9 = 973.8\n\nThis is still lower than my outside option. Let's try offering:\n* Item 1: 0\n* Item 2: 0\n* Item 3: 0\n* Item 4: 0\n* Item 5: 0\nWhich means I get everything. This results in 1224 * .9 = 1101.6.\n\nThe best choice would be to offer player 2 zero of everything.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, taking into account my private values and my outside offer.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 13\n- Item 2: 31\n- Item 3: 8\n- Item 4: 75\n- Item 5: 75\n\nMy outside offer is 583.\n\nI want to make an offer that Player 2 will accept, or at least, that gives me a higher expected value than my outside offer. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I'll start by proposing a fair split. A simple approach is to give Player 2 half of each item (rounding down where necessary, since fractional units are not possible). This ensures I get at least half the value, which might be sufficient in the first round.\n\nHere's the calculation for what I'd keep if I offer half to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 2 / 2 = 1, so offer 1 to Player 2, keep 1. 1 * 13 = 13\n- Item 2: 4 / 2 = 2, so offer 2 to Player 2, keep 2. 2 * 31 = 62\n- Item 3: 4 / 2 = 2, so offer 2 to Player 2, keep 2. 2 * 8 = 16\n- Item 4: 4 / 2 = 2, so offer 2 to Player 2, keep 2. 2 * 75 = 150\n- Item 5: 7 / 2 = 3.5, so offer 3 to Player 2, keep 4. 4 * 75 = 300\n\nTotal value if I keep half is 13 + 62 + 16 + 150 + 300 = 541.  This is less than my outside offer. I need to give less away.\n\nLet's try offering a more aggressive split, giving Player 2 less, so I keep more. This will be risky, as Player 2 may reject. Let's give Player 2:\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 3\nI keep:\n- Item 1: 2, value 26\n- Item 2: 3, value 93\n- Item 3: 3, value 24\n- Item 4: 3, value 225\n- Item 5: 4, value 300\nTotal value = 26 + 93 + 24 + 225 + 300 = 668.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since 191.7 < 296, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away *at this round*.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I have the following items available:\n- Item 1: 8\n- Item 2: 5\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 6\n- Item 5: 1\n\nPlayer 2 currently has:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 0\n\nThis round 1 outcome happened after I offered Player 2 the following:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 1\n\nSo at the end of round 1 I had:\n- Item 1: 8-4 = 4 units\n- Item 2: 5-3 = 2 units\n- Item 3: 3-2 = 1 units\n- Item 4: 6-3 = 3 units\n- Item 5: 1-1 = 0 units\n\nPlayer 2 counteroffered to give me [2, 1, 0, 1, 0], so at the end of round 1 Player 2 had:\n- Item 1: 4+2 = 6\n- Item 2: 3+1 = 4\n- Item 3: 2+0 = 2\n- Item 4: 3+1 = 4\n- Item 5: 1+0 = 1\n\nThe problem is that it's round 2, so if Player 2 counteroffers in round 3 (which is the last round), it is treated as a WALK. Therefore, to reach a deal I must make an offer that Player 2 will accept.\n\nGiven Player 2's offer, it is likely their valuations for each item are reasonably close to mine. To make a deal, I need to give Player 2 enough items to exceed their outside offer. Since I don't know their outside offer, I will propose an even split and hope that they'll accept it.\n\nI propose to give Player 2 [4, 2, 1, 3, 0]\nThis leaves me with [4, 3, 2, 3, 1].

My private values for these items are [47, 22, 6, 19, 87]. My outside offer is 630. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\nItem 1: 4 * 47 = 188\nItem 2: 2 * 22 = 44\nItem 3: 1 * 6 = 6\nItem 4: 3 * 19 = 57\nItem 5: 0 * 87 = 0\nTotal value of current offer = 188 + 44 + 6 + 57 + 0 = 295\n\nNow, let's discount this value to account for the round number.  Since it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nDiscounted value of current offer = 295 * 0.9 = 265.5\n\nSince 265.5 < 630, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To make a good counteroffer, I want to secure a value higher than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. Since this is round 2, any deal needs to be worth at least 630 / 0.9 = 700 to be worthwhile.\n\nI have 8 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. Let's express my current holdings (what I would keep if I accepted the current offer):\nItem 1: 8 - 4 = 4\nItem 2: 5 - 2 = 3\nItem 3: 3 - 1 = 2\nItem 4: 6 - 3 = 3\nItem 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n\nValue of my current holdings (if I accepted) = (4*47) + (3*22) + (2*6) + (3*19) + (1*87) = 188 + 66 + 12 + 57 + 87 = 410\n\nSince the value I would have if I accept the offer is less than my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer or walk away.\n\nLet's try making a counteroffer that gives Player 1 approximately equal value to my outside offer and see how much that is. Currently I have a total value of 705, so for me to get 700 in round 2, the remaining value needs to be at least 700/0.9 = 777.7. However, my total value is only 705, and my outside offer is 630, so I won't likely come to an agreement which gives player 1 more than 630.\n\nThe remaining round is the last one, and the discount factor will further diminish any possible gains from the counteroffer. Therefore, I choose to WALK away now.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I want to maximize my expected value, considering Player 2's rationality. I need to offer Player 2 enough to make them accept, but not so much that I'm giving away value unnecessarily. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I need to make a reasonable guess about what they might find acceptable.\n\nA starting point is to consider an \"equal split\" of the value. I'll aim for something that gives me more than my outside offer of 764, while giving Player 2 at least some value.\n\nA simple approach would be to offer Player 2 roughly half of each item. Let's try offering Player 2 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This gives them:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nWhat I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 92 = 276\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 21 = 42\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 50 = 100\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 23 = 69\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 66 = 66\n\nMy Total Value = 276 + 42 + 100 + 69 + 66 = 553. This is less than my outside offer of 764.\n\nLet's try offering less to Player 2 to ensure I get more than my outside offer.\n\nOffer:\n- Item 1: 2 units to Player 2\n- Item 2: 1 unit to Player 2\n- Item 3: 0 unit to Player 2\n- Item 4: 2 units to Player 2\n- Item 5: 0 unit to Player 2\n\nWhat I keep:\n- Item 1: 4 units = 4 * 92 = 368\n- Item 2: 3 units = 3 * 21 = 63\n- Item 3: 3 units = 3 * 50 = 150\n- Item 4: 4 units = 4 * 23 = 92\n- Item 5: 1 unit = 1 * 66 = 66\n\nMy Total Value = 368 + 63 + 150 + 92 + 66 = 739. This is still slightly less than my outside option, so it's likely not a very persuasive offer.\n\nI'm going to start by trying to get close to a fair split, while still ensuring a decent return for myself. I'll offer:\n\nOffer to Player 2: [3, 2, 1, 3, 0]\n\nThis means I keep [3, 2, 2, 3, 1] which is 3 * 92 + 2 * 21 + 2 * 50 + 3 * 23 + 1 * 66 = 276 + 42 + 100 + 69 + 66 = 553\n\nSince this is less than my outside offer, I should probably just walk. But to play the game, I'll offer something a little more reasonable:\n\nOffer: [2, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [1, 0, 2, 1, 1]. This means Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nThis would leave me with:\n* Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n* Item 2: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n* Item 3: 2 - 2 = 0 units\n* Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n* Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 41 = 41\n* 0 units of item 2: 0 * 24 = 0\n* 0 units of item 3: 0 * 96 = 0\n* 4 units of item 4: 4 * 95 = 380\n* 4 units of item 5: 4 * 29 = 116\n\nTotal value of this offer: 41 + 0 + 0 + 380 + 116 = 537\n\nSince it is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. So the present value of this offer is 537 * 1 = 537\n\nMy outside offer is 788.  Since the current offer (537) is less than my outside offer (788), I should not accept it.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To maximize my value, I want to keep the items I value most and offer the rest to Player 1. I value items 3 and 4 the most. Let's try to keep as much of these items as possible.\n\nThe current offer to me is [1, 0, 2, 1, 1].  This means Player 1 is getting:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1 only items 1 and 5, since I value items 3 and 4 the most.\nI have to offer Player 1 something that is better than walking away for them. I don't know their values.\n\nI should try to make a counteroffer that is slightly better for me than walking away. Let's try giving them all of item 1 and half of item 5. The counteroffer would be: [2, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nThis means I would have:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 3\n\nThe value would be:\nItem 1: 0 * 41 = 0\nItem 2: 0 * 24 = 0\nItem 3: 2 * 96 = 192\nItem 4: 5 * 95 = 475\nItem 5: 3 * 29 = 87\nTotal value = 0 + 0 + 192 + 475 + 87 = 754\n\nThis is less than walking away. So this counteroffer is not good.\n\nSince it is round 1, I can afford to be more aggressive. I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 only the items I value least. Let's give Player 1 all of items 1 and 5. This counteroffer would be [2, 0, 0, 0, 5].\nThis means I would have:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 5\nItem 5: 0\n\nThe value would be:\nItem 1: 0 * 41 = 0\nItem 2: 0 * 24 = 0\nItem 3: 2 * 96 = 192\nItem 4: 5 * 95 = 475\nItem 5: 0 * 29 = 0\nTotal value = 0 + 0 + 192 + 475 + 0 = 667\n\nThis is also less than walking away. So this counteroffer is not good.\n\nSince I don't know Player 1's values, it is difficult to make a beneficial counteroffer at this stage. I will choose to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n*   Item 1: 0 units\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 0 units\n*   Item 4: 1 unit\n*   Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy private values are:\n*   Item 1: 50\n*   Item 2: 76\n*   Item 3: 26\n*   Item 4: 66\n*   Item 5: 8\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 50) + (1 * 76) + (0 * 26) + (1 * 66) + (3 * 8) = 0 + 76 + 0 + 66 + 24 = 166\n\nMy outside offer is 421. Since 166 < 421, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to decide what offer to make to Player 1 to maximize my expected value, considering the possibility of future rounds and the discount factor. Since we are in round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nTo construct a good counteroffer, I should try to get as close to my outside offer as possible while making the offer attractive enough for player 1 to accept. I will try offering player 1 half of the items and see if it makes me better off than my outside offer.\n\nPlayer 1 gets: \n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 1 unit of item 2\n* 0.5 unit of item 3 (since we can't split it, let's give it to player 1 since I don't value item 3 much)\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 4 units of item 5\n\nI keep:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 2 unit of item 2\n* 0 unit of item 3\n* 2 unit of item 4\n* 4 units of item 5\n\nValue of this division to me:\n(1 * 50) + (2 * 76) + (0 * 26) + (2 * 66) + (4 * 8) = 50 + 152 + 0 + 132 + 32 = 366\n\nSince 366 is still less than my outside option, I will offer player 1 almost everything except item 2 since I value it highly. I'll offer them:\n\n* 2 units of item 1\n* 2 unit of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 2 unit of item 4\n* 7 units of item 5\n\nThis means I get:\n* 0 units of item 1\n* 1 unit of item 2\n* 0 units of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 1 units of item 5\n\nValue of this division to me:\n(0 * 50) + (1 * 76) + (0 * 26) + (1 * 66) + (1 * 8) = 0 + 76 + 0 + 66 + 8 = 150\n\nI will still walk away since 150 < 421.\n\nBased on the analysis, it's unlikely I can reach a deal that benefits me more than my outside offer in this round. Therefore, I will walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means I would get:\n\n*   Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n*   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n*   Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n\nMy value for this counteroffer is:\n\n*   3 * 89 (item 1) = 267\n*   1 * 42 (item 2) = 42\n*   1 * 97 (item 3) = 97\n*   2 * 89 (item 4) = 178\n*   3 * 59 (item 5) = 177\n*   Total = 267 + 42 + 97 + 178 + 177 = 761\n\nDiscounted value = 761 * 0.9 = 684.9\n\nThe problem with this counteroffer is that it's significantly less value than accepting the current offer (932.4). I'm not going to gain by making such a drastic counteroffer in round 2.\n\nI will accept.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Since 354 is less than 572, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNext, I consider making a counteroffer. I need to determine if there's a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept that is also better than my outside offer.  Since this is round 1, and the discount factor is 0.9, I need to achieve more than (572 / 0.9) = 635.56 in value to myself for any deal to be worthwhile.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 the minimum amount they might accept. It is difficult to know their values, so I'll start by making a counteroffer that gives them relatively little, but still something, and assess from there.\nI will offer Player 1: [3, 0, 4, 0, 3]\nThis means I keep: [4, 0, 4, 0, 4]\nMy value would then be:\n(4 * 43) + (0 * 14) + (4 * 68) + (0 * 59) + (4 * 32) = 172 + 0 + 272 + 0 + 128 = 572.\nThis is equal to my outside option, so it is not better.\n\nLet's try to get a little more for myself, offering Player 1 [3, 0, 5, 0, 3]. That would leave me with [4, 0, 3, 0, 4] for a value of (4 * 43) + (0 * 14) + (3 * 68) + (0 * 59) + (4 * 32) = 172 + 0 + 204 + 0 + 128 = 504 which is not good enough.\n\nI believe my best option at this point is to WALK, as I am unlikely to come to a better agreement.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since 823 < 1060, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, I need to decide if I should make a counteroffer. Given that this is round 1, there are two more rounds of negotiation. I should try to improve my position. I need to calculate how much of each item I have to give to player 1.\nAvailable amounts: item 1:5, item 2:2, item 3:9, item 4:7, item 5:3.\n\nThe current offer to me means I would keep:\n- Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2\n- Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1\n- Item 3: 9 - 5 = 4\n- Item 4: 7 - 3 = 4\n- Item 5: 3 - 2 = 1\n\nI will make a counteroffer to try and get closer to my outside offer value.  I'll aim for an offer that gives Player 1 slightly more than half of the total value they would receive if I accepted their initial offer, assuming their values are similar to mine, and hope they accept in round 2.\n\nLet's make a counteroffer where I offer them [2, 1, 4, 3, 1]. This would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3\n- Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1\n- Item 3: 9 - 4 = 5\n- Item 4: 7 - 3 = 4\n- Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\nValue to me: (3 * 72) + (1 * 50) + (5 * 92) + (4 * 29) + (2 * 5) = 216 + 50 + 460 + 116 + 10 = 852. Still below my outside offer, but an improvement on their initial offer. I will proceed with this for now.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 3, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 2 has offered me [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]. This means they're offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* 0 units of item 1: 0 * 60 = 0\n* 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 47 = 47\n* 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 11 = 11\n* 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 19 = 19\n* 2 units of item 5: 2 * 4 = 8\nTotal value of the offer: 0 + 47 + 11 + 19 + 8 = 85\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nSo, the present value of the offer is 85 * 0.9 = 76.5\n\nMy outside offer is 296.  Since 76.5 is significantly less than 296, accepting this offer would be a bad move.\n\nNow I need to decide between walking away and making a counteroffer. If I walk away, I get 296.  If I make a counteroffer, I have one more round to try to get a better deal, but it will be discounted by 0.9.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I need to figure out what's a reasonable offer that Player 2 might accept. Their current offer suggests they value items 3, 4, and 5 more than I do, and items 1 and 2 less. Let's try offering them a relatively even split of the items, slightly favoring them on items 3, 4, and 5.\n\nHow about I offer them [0, 2, 2, 2, 3]?  This means I keep:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 2 unit of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 2 unit of item 5\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n* 1 * 60 = 60\n* 2 * 47 = 94\n* 1 * 11 = 11\n* 1 * 19 = 19\n* 2 * 4 = 8\nTotal Value = 60 + 94 + 11 + 19 + 8 = 192\nDiscounted Value = 192 * 0.9 = 172.8\n\nThis isn't better than walking away, so let's adjust my offer to give myself more:\nOffer: [0, 3, 3, 3, 4] - Giving a little more to them. \nMy Keep:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 1 unit of item 2\n* 0 unit of item 3\n* 0 unit of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n* 1 * 60 = 60\n* 1 * 47 = 47\n* 0 * 11 = 0\n* 0 * 19 = 0\n* 1 * 4 = 4\nTotal Value = 60 + 47 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 111\nDiscounted Value = 111 * 0.9 = 99.9 - This is awful.\n\nMaybe they undervalue item 1, I will offer more of other items:\nOffer: [0, 1, 0, 0, 2] - Giving a little less to them.\nMy Keep:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 3 unit of item 2\n* 3 unit of item 3\n* 3 unit of item 4\n* 3 unit of item 5\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n* 1 * 60 = 60\n* 3 * 47 = 141\n* 3 * 11 = 33\n* 3 * 19 = 57\n* 3 * 4 = 12\nTotal Value = 60 + 141 + 33 + 57 + 12 = 303\nDiscounted Value = 303 * 0.9 = 272.7\n\nMy Outside option is 296.\n\nGiven my values, I think it's most advantageous to WALK. I am not seeing an easy path for a deal at this point, as the last value is the highest I can possibly have after giving them minimal items, which gives me discounted value lower than outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

The key is to make an offer that's attractive enough for Player 2 to consider, but still leaves me with a value greater than or equal to my outside offer (906), considering the discount factor in subsequent rounds.\n\nMy strategy is to offer a split that provides me with slightly above my outside offer value. In round 1 the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nI will attempt to obtain a value of around 910 from this deal for myself.\n\nThe total value is 977 so I can offer Player 2 977 - 910 = 67\n\nLet us provide Player 2 with the following items:\nItem 1: 1 unit, value to me: 4\nItem 2: 0 unit, value to me: 0\nItem 3: 0 unit, value to me: 0\nItem 4: 0 unit, value to me: 0\nItem 5: 4 unit, value to me: 56\n\nTotal value to me: 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 56 = 60\nThis is too low.\n\nLet us provide Player 2 with the following items:\nItem 1: 0 unit, value to me: 0\nItem 2: 0 unit, value to me: 0\nItem 3: 0 unit, value to me: 0\nItem 4: 0 unit, value to me: 0\nItem 5: 4 unit, value to me: 56\nItem 1: 2 unit, value to me: 8\nItem 2: 0 unit, value to me: 0\nItem 3: 0 unit, value to me: 0\nItem 4: 0 unit, value to me: 0\nItem 5: 0 unit, value to me: 0\n\nTotal value to me: 8 + 56 = 64\nThis is still too low\n\nLet's create an offer that gives Player 2 enough value to entice them to accept while still securing a high value for myself. I will start by offering player 2 the following:\n\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 0\nItem 5: 4\n\nThis corresponds to a value of 4*14=56.

It is hard to find good combinations. Let us offer equal amounts.\n\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2\nValue = 3 * 4 + 1 * 91 + 2 * 79 + 2 * 79 + 2 * 14 = 12 + 91 + 158 + 158 + 28 = 447\n\nThen I receive:\nItem 1: 4, Value = 16\nItem 2: 1, Value = 91\nItem 3: 3, Value = 237\nItem 4: 2, Value = 158\nItem 5: 2, Value = 28\n\nTotal Value = 16 + 91 + 237 + 158 + 28 = 530\n\nI need to obtain at least 906 for myself.

Thus, the present value of accepting the current offer is 267 * 0.9 = 240.3.\n\nMy outside offer is 906, and since 240.3 < 906, accepting is not better than walking away *at face value*. However, this is round 2 of 3.\n\nThe remaining items I have to distribute:\nItem 1: 7 - 1 = 6\nItem 2: 2 - 1 = 1\nItem 3: 5 - 1 = 4\nItem 4: 4 - 1 = 3\nItem 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my return, knowing that if we reach round 3 without a deal, I will walk.  If I counteroffer and player 2 walks at the end of this round 2, then both players get their outside offers which might be a good strategy given the large discrepancy between my current offer value and outside offer.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 everything I can in terms of item 1, 3 and 4, and minimizing the units for item 2. The goal is to meet somewhere above my outside offer in a way to entice Player 2.\nSo I am considering something like giving them:\nItem 1: 6\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 3\n\nMeaning I would keep 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4 and 1 of item 5 for a value of 267 (which is less than my outside offer).\n\nTherefore, I should just walk away and take my guaranteed 906.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nSince this is the first round and there is no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. My goal is to maximize my expected payoff, taking into account the possibility of future rounds and my outside offer.\n\nA good starting point is to consider splitting the items roughly in half, giving Player 2 a reasonable offer that they might accept. However, since my values for items 1, 2, and 5 are significantly higher than my values for items 3 and 4, I will try to keep more of those.\n\nHere's a possible offer:\n* Item 1: Give 0 to Player 2 (keep 1 for myself)\n* Item 2: Give 1 to Player 2 (keep 2 for myself)\n* Item 3: Give 2 to Player 2 (keep 2 for myself)\n* Item 4: Give 1 to Player 2 (keep 1 for myself)\n* Item 5: Give 2 to Player 2 (keep 3 for myself)\n\nNow let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n* Item 1: 1 * 86 = 86\n* Item 2: 2 * 47 = 94\n* Item 3: 2 * 7 = 14\n* Item 4: 1 * 25 = 25\n* Item 5: 3 * 36 = 108\nTotal value = 86 + 94 + 14 + 25 + 108 = 327\n\nThis value (327) is significantly higher than my outside offer (187). Let's consider a slightly more aggressive offer to see if Player 2 will accept something more in my favor.\n\n* Item 1: Give 0 to Player 2 (keep 1 for myself)\n* Item 2: Give 0 to Player 2 (keep 3 for myself)\n* Item 3: Give 3 to Player 2 (keep 1 for myself)\n* Item 4: Give 1 to Player 2 (keep 1 for myself)\n* Item 5: Give 2 to Player 2 (keep 3 for myself)\n\nValue Calculation:\n* Item 1: 1 * 86 = 86\n* Item 2: 3 * 47 = 141\n* Item 3: 1 * 7 = 7\n* Item 4: 1 * 25 = 25\n* Item 5: 3 * 36 = 108\nTotal Value: 86 + 141 + 7 + 25 + 108 = 367\n\nThis is a very good value for me.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 269. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 504 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I am Player 1, and I have the first move. I need to decide whether to WALK away immediately or make a COUNTEROFFER. Since there's no current offer to accept, those are my only two options.\n\nMy values for the items are:\n- Item 1: 14 (4 units available)\n- Item 2: 20 (3 units available)\n- Item 3: 90 (9 units available)\n- Item 4: 4 (4 units available)\n- Item 5: 40 (0 units available)\n\nMy outside offer is 269.\n\nMy goal is to maximize my discounted value from the negotiation. Since it's the first round, I want to make an offer that's attractive enough for Player 2 to accept in either round 2 or 3 (assuming they are rational), but also gives me a good share of the items.\n\nI need to estimate Player 2's valuation. Since the values are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101, on average, Player 2's values are likely to be around 51. I need to make an offer such that Player 2 gets at least their outside option value.\n\nLet's start by considering a relatively even split and adjust from there. I will aim to give Player 2 an offer that's slightly above half the total possible value.\n\nTotal available items: 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 9 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n\nLet's try giving Player 2 approximately half of each item.\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this would be:\n- 2 * 14 = 28\n- 2 * 20 = 40\n- 5 * 90 = 450\n- 2 * 4 = 8\n- 0 * 40 = 0\nTotal = 526\n\nPlayer 2 would get:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nNow, to make this offer more attractive, I can shift some of the valuable item 3 to Player 2. Let's give them 5 units of Item 3 and take 4 for myself.\n\nSo, the new offer to Player 2 is:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 4 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nMy value would then be:\n- 2 * 14 = 28\n- 2 * 20 = 40\n- 4 * 90 = 360\n- 2 * 4 = 8\n- 0 * 40 = 0\nTotal = 436\n\nThis is still significantly above my outside option. Given Player 2's average item value estimate, this offer looks reasonable.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 5, 2, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

A common starting point is to propose a 50/50 split. I need to consider the quantities available.\n\nHere's a potential initial offer that attempts a roughly even split:\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 1 to Player 2 (keeping 1 for myself)\n*   Item 2: Offer 4 to Player 2 (keeping 4 for myself)\n*   Item 3: Offer 1 to Player 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\n*   Item 4: Offer 2 to Player 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\n*   Item 5: Offer 0 to Player 2 (keeping 0 for myself)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of this offer to *me*:\n\n*   Item 1: 1 * 72 = 72\n*   Item 2: 4 * 64 = 256\n*   Item 3: 2 * 48 = 96\n*   Item 4: 2 * 59 = 118\n*   Item 5: 0 * 75 = 0\n\nTotal value for me: 72 + 256 + 96 + 118 + 0 = 542\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 993.

I want to maximize my value, so I want to give Player 2 the minimum amount necessary for them to accept. Since it is round 2, there is limited negotiation potential. The goal is to offer them just enough to be above their outside offer.\n\nI have 2 units of item 1, 8 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5. Player 2's offer to me was 1 unit of items 1, 2, 3, and 4. This means I have 1 unit of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, and 3 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5 left for myself if I accepted their offer.\nLet's try to construct an offer such that I keep most of the high-value items for myself and only give away low-value items. Given that it is round 2, and the other agent has already made an offer, I believe the other agent's valuation for the items will be near my own. Therefore, an offer that leaves me with the majority of items should be viable.\n\nI will offer Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\nThat means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5 for myself.\nMy value will be 1 * 72 + 4 * 64 + 2 * 48 + 2 * 59 + 0 * 75 = 72 + 256 + 96 + 118 + 0 = 542\nDiscounted Value = 542 * 0.9 = 487.8\n\nThis is still much less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that is closer to my outside offer. Let's try offering Player 2 less: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5. Then I keep 2, 7, 3, 4, and 0 units respectively.\n\nMy value would be 2 * 72 + 7 * 64 + 3 * 48 + 4 * 59 + 0 * 75 = 144 + 448 + 144 + 236 + 0 = 972\nDiscounted value is 972 * 0.9 = 874.8, which is still less than my outside offer.\n\nI'm going to walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I want to make an offer that is attractive enough for Player 2 to consider, but also leaves me with a good portion of the items. Without knowing Player 2's values, it's difficult to make a truly optimal offer. A good starting point might be to offer Player 2 roughly half the items.

I have the following items to distribute:\n* 3 units of item 1\n* 6 units of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 3 units of item 4\n* 4 units of item 5\n\nI want to maximize my own value. I need to consider what Player 1 likely values these items at to make a counteroffer they would accept. Since I don't know Player 1's values, I'll make a counteroffer that gives them a significant portion of the items, leaving me with enough to exceed my outside option value.\n\nI will offer Player 1: [2, 3, 1, 2, 2]. This leaves me with [1, 3, 0, 1, 2]. The value of the items I'm offering them is unknown, but it hopefully provides them more value than their outside offer. The value to me is [1, 3, 0, 1, 2] which is 182.\n\nTo make this round relevant, I need to make 182 * .9^0 > 326 * .9^1\n182 > 293.4, which it is not. Therefore, I need to make the value of the offer higher to me than 326.\n\nInstead, let me create an offer that I would be happy with.\n\nOffer them [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I get 3 * 89 + 6 * 6 + 1 * 64 + 3 * 1 + 4 * 37 = 267 + 36 + 64 + 3 + 148 = 518.\n518 * 0.9^0 > 326 * 0.9^1\n518 > 293.4\n\nThis may not be accepted by the other player, but it is my best option, as otherwise I am better off walking away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 935. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 2 is offering me [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My values for these items are 19, 76, 92, 48, and 4. My outside offer is 935. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 19 = 19\n*   2 units of item 2: 2 * 76 = 152\n*   2 units of item 3: 2 * 92 = 184\n*   2 units of item 4: 2 * 48 = 96\n*   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 4 = 4\n\nTotal value of current offer = 19 + 152 + 184 + 96 + 4 = 455\n\nNow, let's discount this value by one round (gamma ^ (r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9):\n\nDiscounted value of current offer = 455 * 0.9 = 409.5\n\nSince 409.5 is much less than my outside offer of 935, accepting is not a good option.\n\nNow let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer something that Player 2 might accept, while still giving me more value than my outside offer, when discounted.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items:\n\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 19 = 57\n*   5 units of item 2: 5 * 76 = 380\n*   5 units of item 3: 5 * 92 = 460\n*   4 units of item 4: 4 * 48 = 192\n*   3 units of item 5: 3 * 4 = 12\n\nTotal value = 57 + 380 + 460 + 192 + 12 = 1101\n\nI'm going to make a counteroffer to attempt to claim more items, which will increase my payout while still making a reasonable offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 the following: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nThis means I keep: [3, 4, 4, 3, 3]\nValue to me:\n3*19 + 4*76 + 4*92 + 3*48 + 3*4 = 57 + 304 + 368 + 144 + 12 = 885\nDiscounted Value to me: 885 * .9 = 796.5\nThis is less than my outside option, so it's not a good deal.\n\nLet's offer Player 2 [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]. Then I have [3, 4, 4, 4, 3]\nValue to me: 3*19 + 4*76 + 4*92 + 4*48 + 3*4 = 57 + 304 + 368 + 192 + 12 = 933\nDiscounted: 933*.9 = 839.7. Still less than my outside option.\n\nLet's offer [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]. This puts me back where I started. Let's try to be slightly more aggressive.\n\nLet's offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That would be awesome for me, but is unrealistic. Let's aim to get at least my outside value.\n\nLet's try giving [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2. That means I have: [2, 4, 4, 3, 2]\nValue to me: 2*19 + 4*76 + 4*92 + 3*48 + 2*4 = 38 + 304 + 368 + 144 + 8 = 862\nDiscounted Value: 862*.9 = 775.8.

My general strategy is to propose a split that gives Player 2 slightly more than their *expected* outside offer, discounted appropriately for round 2.\n\nTo figure out a good first offer, I need to estimate what Player 2's total value might be. A rough estimate is to assume their values are around 50 (midpoint of 1-101), giving a total valuation of 7 * 50 + 4 * 50 + 4 * 50 + 5 * 50 + 5 * 50 = 350 + 200 + 200 + 250 + 250 = 1250. Given that Player 2's outside option is drawn from a uniform distribution ranging from 1 to their total value of all items, Player 2's expected outside offer is 1250 / 2 = 625 (approximately). Discounted by 0.9 (gamma), this is 562.5. So I should offer Player 2 at least enough to meet this value.\n\nLet's start by offering Player 2 half of everything.\n\nOffer: [3, 2, 2, 2, 2].\n\nThis means I keep: [4, 2, 2, 3, 3].\n\nMy value: 4 * 54 + 2 * 41 + 2 * 70 + 3 * 81 + 3 * 43 = 216 + 82 + 140 + 243 + 129 = 810. This is already higher than my outside option, so that's good.\n\nLet's see what Player 2 gets:\n3 * 50 + 2 * 50 + 2 * 50 + 2 * 50 + 2 * 50 = 150 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 550.\n\nLet's adjust this offer so that Player 2 is closer to their expected discounted outside option.\nOffer: [3, 1, 1, 2, 2].\nI keep: [4, 3, 3, 3, 3].\nMy value: 4 * 54 + 3 * 41 + 3 * 70 + 3 * 81 + 3 * 43 = 216 + 123 + 210 + 243 + 129 = 921\n\nPlayer 2 gets:\n3 * 50 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 50 + 2 * 50 + 2 * 50 = 150 + 50 + 50 + 100 + 100 = 450.\n\nLet's try an offer skewed towards item 4, as this has the highest value to me:\nOffer: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nI keep: [5, 3, 3, 4, 4]\nMy value: 5 * 54 + 3 * 41 + 3 * 70 + 4 * 81 + 4 * 43 = 270 + 123 + 210 + 324 + 172 = 1099\n\nPlayer 2 gets:\n2 * 50 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 50 = 100 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 50 = 300.\n\nThis is much less than my value, but may be rejected by the opponent.\n\nI should make an offer that gives me close to half the total value.\nTo do this, I will increase item 4 and decrease item 1\n\nOffer: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nI keep: [6, 3, 3, 5, 4]\nMy value: 6 * 54 + 3 * 41 + 3 * 70 + 5 * 81 + 4 * 43 = 324 + 123 + 210 + 405 + 172 = 1234\n\nPlayer 2 gets:\n1 * 50 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 50 + 0 * 50 + 1 * 50 = 50 + 50 + 50 + 0 + 50 = 200.\n\nFinal Offer:\nOffer: [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nI keep: [5, 3, 3, 3, 4]\nMy value: 5 * 54 + 3 * 41 + 3 * 70 + 3 * 81 + 4 * 43 = 270 + 123 + 210 + 243 + 172 = 1018\nPlayer 2:\n2 * 50 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 50 + 2 * 50 + 1 * 50 = 100 + 50 + 50 + 100 + 50 = 350.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since 315 is significantly less than 1087, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I need to figure out how to distribute the items such that I get the most valuable items and Player 1 gets the rest, while ensuring the offer is somewhat appealing to Player 1. I will only consider offering whole units. I have to give Player 1 at least some of each item to entice them to consider the offer.\nHere's a simple strategy: I'll aim for an offer that gives Player 1 roughly half of what is available. It will be better for me than the current offer but might be enticing enough for the other player to avoid the outside option in Round 2.\n\nAvailable items:\n*   Item 1: 7\n*   Item 2: 4\n*   Item 3: 4\n*   Item 4: 5\n*   Item 5: 5\n\nLet's offer Player 1: [3, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nThat would leave me with:\n*   Item 1: 4\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 2\n*   Item 4: 3\n*   Item 5: 3\n\nMy value for this would be: (4 * 13) + (2 * 52) + (2 * 69) + (3 * 65) + (3 * 38) = 52 + 104 + 138 + 195 + 114 = 603.\n\nSince this is lower than the outside offer, I must offer the first player more of the items than this offer, since it is not better than walking away.\nLet's try offering [2,1,1,1,1] to Player 1. Then I would have 5 of Item 1, 3 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 4 of Item 4, 4 of Item 5.\nMy valuation would be: 5*13 + 3*52 + 3*69 + 4*65 + 4*38 = 65 + 156 + 207 + 260 + 152 = 840. Still lower than the outside offer of 1087.\n\nLet's try offering only 1 of each to Player 1.\nMy offer to Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nThat would leave me with:\n*   Item 1: 6\n*   Item 2: 3\n*   Item 3: 3\n*   Item 4: 4\n*   Item 5: 4\nMy value for this would be: (6 * 13) + (3 * 52) + (3 * 69) + (4 * 65) + (4 * 38) = 78 + 156 + 207 + 260 + 152 = 853\nSince 853 is much lower than my outside offer of 1087, I will walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Since 374 is significantly less than 699, accepting the current offer is not optimal.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, taking into account the discount factor in future rounds. In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nI have the following quantities of each item:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 4\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 6\n\nThe current offer implies Player 1 has:\n- Item 1: 4-2 = 2\n- Item 2: 1-0 = 1\n- Item 3: 4-2 = 2\n- Item 4: 4-2 = 2\n- Item 5: 6-3 = 3\n\nI will aim for a split that gives me at least 699 after discounting if we reach later rounds. A reasonable starting point is to offer Player 1 half of everything and then tweak based on my values. I will make a counteroffer to Player 1 giving them:\n\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 0.5. Since I can only offer whole numbers, I will offer 0.\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 3\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2 -> 2 * 28 = 56\n- Item 2: 1 -> 1 * 96 = 96\n- Item 3: 2 -> 2 * 23 = 46\n- Item 4: 2 -> 2 * 7 = 14\n- Item 5: 3 -> 3 * 86 = 258\nTotal value: 56 + 96 + 46 + 14 + 258 = 470.\n\nThis is still significantly less than my outside offer. I will offer more to Player 1. I can consider offering Player 1 all of Item 2 since I only have 1, and Player 1 offering me 0 indicates they don't value it much.\n\nRevised counteroffer to Player 1:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 3\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2 -> 2 * 28 = 56\n- Item 2: 0 -> 0 * 96 = 0\n- Item 3: 2 -> 2 * 23 = 46\n- Item 4: 2 -> 2 * 7 = 14\n- Item 5: 3 -> 3 * 86 = 258\nTotal value: 56 + 0 + 46 + 14 + 258 = 374.\n\nStill less than my outside offer.\nLet's think about what items Player 1 might value less than I do. My lowest value item is Item 4, so let's offer them more of that.\n\nCounteroffer to Player 1:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 3\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2 -> 2 * 28 = 56\n- Item 2: 0 -> 0 * 96 = 0\n- Item 3: 2 -> 2 * 23 = 46\n- Item 4: 0 -> 0 * 7 = 0\n- Item 5: 3 -> 3 * 86 = 258\nTotal value: 56 + 0 + 46 + 0 + 258 = 360\n\nI should make the best offer I can in Round 1 as the discount factor will reduce my outcome if I go to further rounds. To exceed my outside offer, I need to retain at least 699 in value. Let's try giving almost everything to player 1 except my most valuable item, item 2, and some of item 5.\n\nCounteroffer to Player 1:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 4\n- Item 4: 4\n- Item 5: 4\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 0 -> 0 * 28 = 0\n- Item 2: 1 -> 1 * 96 = 96\n- Item 3: 0 -> 0 * 23 = 0\n- Item 4: 0 -> 0 * 7 = 0\n- Item 5: 2 -> 2 * 86 = 172\nTotal value: 0 + 96 + 0 + 0 + 172 = 268\n\nThis is still far from my outside offer.\n\nI will make a counteroffer where I give Player 1 less of my most valuable items, even if it seems greedy.\n\nCounteroffer to Player 1:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2 -> 2 * 28 = 56\n- Item 2: 1 -> 1 * 96 = 96\n- Item 3: 2 -> 2 * 23 = 46\n- Item 4: 2 -> 2 * 7 = 14\n- Item 5: 4 -> 4 * 86 = 344\nTotal value: 56 + 96 + 46 + 14 + 344 = 556\n\nStill less than my outside offer.\nI will walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

That is still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's offer them something that makes them more of a winner in this deal\nPlayer 1: 0 item 1, 0 item 2, 0 item 3, 0 item 4, 0 item 5\nI would get the whole stash worth 962\n\nPlayer 1: 0 item 1, 1 item 2, 3 item 3, 1 item 4, 2 item 5\nI would get 5 item 1, 1 item 2, 3 item 3, 0 item 4, 1 item 5.\nThis would give me: 5 * 48 + 1 * 76 + 3 * 51 + 0 * 27 + 1 * 79 = 240 + 76 + 153 + 0 + 79 = 548\n\nLet's offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis gives me: 962 which is better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This is way too low.\n\nI will try to improve by keeping item 5 and make a counteroffer of [1, 5, 3, 3, 0].\n\nThat means I keep:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (1 * 3 = 3)\n- Item 2: 4 units (4 * 66 = 264)\n- Item 3: 2 units (2 * 6 = 12)\n- Item 4: 2 units (2 * 60 = 120)\n- Item 5: 3 unit (3 * 85 = 255)\n\nTotal Value = 3 + 264 + 12 + 120 + 255 = 654\n\nThis is still below 912.\n\nLet's be a bit more aggressive and offer [1, 6, 4, 4, 2] to Player 1.\n\nI keep:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (1 * 3 = 3)\n- Item 2: 3 units (3 * 66 = 198)\n- Item 3: 1 units (1 * 6 = 6)\n- Item 4: 1 units (1 * 60 = 60)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (1 * 85 = 85)\n\nTotal Value = 3 + 198 + 6 + 60 + 85 = 352. Still below 912.\n\nI will try to keep most items.\nHere's a new counteroffer: [2, 8, 5, 5, 3] - meaning player 1 gets everything\n\nMy value is zero! So I have to take into account the discount in round 2. 912/0.9 = 1013.\nIf I offer the other player nothing then my value is 1185. In round 2 it will be 1185*.9 = 1066.\n\nIf I offer them everything and keep nothing, the total item value is 0 which is lower.\nTherefore, the optimal play is to propose a trade that gives the other player something to make it worthwhile to accept and give me more than 912.\n\nLet me try [0, 5, 2, 2, 0] as a counteroffer to player 1. I get to keep the rest.\n- Item 1: 2 (2*3 = 6)\n- Item 2: 4 (4*66 = 264)\n- Item 3: 3 (3*6 = 18)\n- Item 4: 3 (3*60 = 180)\n- Item 5: 3 (3*85 = 255)\n\n6+264+18+180+255 = 723.\nIt is still lower than the outside offer.\n\nThe outside offer of 912 represents a decent deal.\nTherefore, I will WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by outlining my objective: maximize my discounted value, considering my outside offer of 475 and my private values.\n\nSince there's no current offer, I need to make the first offer. I want to make an offer that's attractive enough for Player 2 to accept, but also gives me a good value.  I don't know Player 2's values, so I need to make an educated guess about what they might want. A simple strategy is to offer Player 2 slightly more than half of the total value, aiming for an equal split or leaning slightly in their favor to increase the chance of acceptance.\n\nI have:\n* 6 units of item 1 (value 34) = 204\n* 3 units of item 2 (value 19) = 57\n* 3 units of item 3 (value 78) = 234\n* 7 units of item 4 (value 22) = 154\n* 1 units of item 5 (value 42) = 42\nTotal value: 204 + 57 + 234 + 154 + 42 = 691\n\nIf I give half the items to Player 2, my value is 691 / 2 = 345.5\nIf I give slightly more to Player 2, this value will decrease.\n\nGiven my outside offer of 475, simply halving the items doesn't guarantee a better outcome. I need to offer something that, when discounted, will be better than 475 for both of us. I need to incentivize player 2 to accept in round 1.\n\nAnother strategy is to offer player 2 items where I have a low value, and I keep the items where I have a high value. But without any information on Player 2's preferences, this is difficult.\n\nLet's start with a roughly even split, but give them a slightly better offer and see how it goes.\n\nI will give player 2:\n- 3 item 1\n- 1 item 2\n- 1 item 3\n- 3 item 4\n- 0 item 5\n\nThen I get\n- 3 item 1 = 3 * 34 = 102\n- 2 item 2 = 2 * 19 = 38\n- 2 item 3 = 2 * 78 = 156\n- 4 item 4 = 4 * 22 = 88\n- 1 item 5 = 1 * 42 = 42\nTotal value: 102 + 38 + 156 + 88 + 42 = 426\n\nPlayer 2 gets:\n- 3 item 1 = 3 * v1_p2\n- 1 item 2 = 1 * v2_p2\n- 1 item 3 = 1 * v3_p2\n- 3 item 4 = 3 * v4_p2\n- 0 item 5 = 0 * v5_p2\n\nI think I'm undervaluing my offer based on my outside offer and I want to move towards the outside offer as a baseline.\n\nI'll try offering a different split to target a slightly larger portion of the pie to myself, while still giving the other player enough for them to consider it.\n\nGive them:\n- 2 item 1\n- 1 item 2\n- 1 item 3\n- 3 item 4\n- 0 item 5\nThen I get\n- 4 item 1 = 4 * 34 = 136\n- 2 item 2 = 2 * 19 = 38\n- 2 item 3 = 2 * 78 = 156\n- 4 item 4 = 4 * 22 = 88\n- 1 item 5 = 1 * 42 = 42\nTotal value: 136 + 38 + 156 + 88 + 42 = 460\n\nThis is still a little low, so I will try to aim a bit higher. I think player 2 will walk if I give them this.\nLet me give:\n- 2 item 1\n- 0 item 2\n- 0 item 3\n- 2 item 4\n- 0 item 5\n\nThen I get\n- 4 item 1 = 4 * 34 = 136\n- 3 item 2 = 3 * 19 = 57\n- 3 item 3 = 3 * 78 = 234\n- 5 item 4 = 5 * 22 = 110\n- 1 item 5 = 1 * 42 = 42\nTotal value: 136 + 57 + 234 + 110 + 42 = 579\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer.

The offer would be [5, 2, 2, 6, 0], which leaves me with [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The total value of what remains for me would be: 34 + 19 + 78 + 22 + 42 = 195. This is much lower than the value needed.\n\nLet's make a more reasonable offer. Give the player half of each item. The counteroffer I will make to Player 2 is: [3, 1, 1, 3, 0]. This would mean I would keep [3, 2, 2, 4, 1], which amounts to: 3*34 + 2*19 + 2*78 + 4*22 + 1*42 = 102 + 38 + 156 + 88 + 42 = 426. This is lower than the value needed of 527.78.

My goal is to maximize my expected payoff, considering my outside option of 349 and the discount factor of 0.9.\n\nTo make a reasonable offer, I should try to estimate Player 2's possible values. Since Player 2's values are drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 101, similar to mine, I'll aim for an offer that gives Player 2 roughly half the total value if they value the items similarly to me.\n\nHere's how I'll approach this:\n1. Calculate the total value of all items based on my values:\n   - Item 1: 3 * 75 = 225\n   - Item 2: 3 * 32 = 96\n   - Item 3: 2 * 30 = 60\n   - Item 4: 4 * 78 = 312\n   - Item 5: 4 * 26 = 104\n   - Total value = 225 + 96 + 60 + 312 + 104 = 797\n\n2. A fair split (assuming similar valuations) would give me and Player 2 around 797 / 2 = 398.5. To make sure I get more than my outside offer, I want to aim for slightly above 349 after the discount factor is applied if the negotiations continue for multiple rounds.\n\n3. Let's start by offering Player 2 a little less than half the items according to my valuation, and see what happens. I want to secure at least value of 349 for myself so I will try to offer items valuing 448 (797-349) to the other agent.\n\n4.  I will start by allocating items 1 to Player 2: 3 items of item1 = 3 * 75 = 225. 448-225 = 223\n Next, I will allocate items 4 to Player 2: 2 items of item4 = 2 * 78 = 156. 223 - 156 = 67\n Now, I will allocate items 2 to Player 2: 2 items of item2 = 2 * 32 = 64. 67 - 64 = 3\nLastly, I will allocate 1 item of item5 to Player 2.\n\n5.

Since it is round 1, there are still two rounds of negotiation to go. Let's try to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside option, but not too generous to player 1. Since my strongest values are items 3 and 4, I want to keep most of these.\nI will offer the following to Player 1: [2, 2, 1, 2, 2].

Therefore, let's consider increasing the offer to player 1, so I can keep more of my high value items. How about [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]? This will give me\n- Item 1: 2 units * 14 = 28\n- Item 2: 2 units * 45 = 90\n- Item 3: 2 units * 69 = 138\n- Item 4: 3 units * 72 = 216\n- Item 5: 3 units * 14 = 42\nTotal Value = 28+90+138+216+42 = 514\n\nMy first counteroffer was not good enough, so let's try again. I will offer player 1 the following: [2, 1, 0, 1, 2].\nThen I get\n- Item 1: 1 * 14 = 14\n- Item 2: 2 * 45 = 90\n- Item 3: 2 * 69 = 138\n- Item 4: 3 * 72 = 216\n- Item 5: 2 * 14 = 28\nTotal: 14 + 90 + 138 + 216 + 28 = 486\nThis is better than my outside offer and a good starting point.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Suppose I offer Player 1 the following: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means I would get:\n* Item 1: 3 * 14 = 42\n* Item 2: 3 * 45 = 135\n* Item 3: 2 * 69 = 138\n* Item 4: 4 * 72 = 288\n* Item 5: 4 * 14 = 56\nTotal: 659\nDiscounted value: 659 * 0.9 = 593.1\n\nIf I offer anything, it means that the negotiation fails, since it's the last round for counteroffers. If I walk, my outside offer is 308. I can't achieve a better outcome.\n\nTherefore, I should walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's think step by step.\n\nSince there's no current offer, I need to make the first offer. My goal is to maximize my expected value, considering the possibility of Player 2 walking away or making counteroffers. I need to offer Player 2 enough to make them accept, but not so much that I leave value on the table.\n\nMy values per item are: 56, 47, 44, 75, 13. The total number of items are: 6, 2, 3, 3, 5. My outside offer is 415.\n\nLet's start by considering what Player 2's minimum acceptable offer might be. Since their values are between 1 and 101, the maximum possible value of all items for them would be 6*101 + 2*101 + 3*101 + 3*101 + 5*101 = 19*101 = 1919. Therefore, Player 2's outside option is somewhere between 1 and 1919.\n\nI will construct an offer that gives Player 2 a value slightly higher than what I think their minimum value would be. I don't know their exact values, so I will estimate it as if all the items are valued at 50. I'll create an offer to give Player 2 half the items and increase it until it is above my outside option.\n\nI'll start with giving Player 2 half of each item (rounded down), i.e. [3, 1, 1, 1, 2].\nPlayer 2 maximum value for this would be 3*101 + 1*101 + 1*101 + 1*101 + 2*101 = 8*101 = 808. I want to offer a value of less than my total possible value but more than my outside option, so I'm aiming to give player 2 roughly 450 if they valued the items the same as me, however, because they might value the items less than me, I might have to offer them more items for the same utility.\n\nMy best option is to offer player 2 the smallest amount possible that makes a deal happen. It is likely that my first offer will be rejected, but this is ok because there are still two rounds of negotiations after this one, but I do want to try to make a deal in the first round, so I'm not losing any value in the discount factor. I'm going to create an offer where I keep 3 item 1s, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4, and 2 item 5s.\n\nThis offer means that I will be giving the other agent: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. The total value to me of the items I keep is: 3 * 56 + 1 * 47 + 1 * 44 + 1 * 75 + 2 * 13 = 168 + 47 + 44 + 75 + 26 = 360. The value for me of giving this offer away would be 852-360 = 492. This is more than my outside option, so let's try improving my offer.\n\nI'm going to create an offer where I keep 4 item 1s, 1 item 2, 2 item 3, 2 item 4, and 4 item 5s.\n\nThis offer means that I will be giving the other agent: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, and 1 units of item 5. The total value to me of the items I keep is: 4 * 56 + 1 * 47 + 2 * 44 + 2 * 75 + 4 * 13 = 224 + 47 + 88 + 150 + 52 = 561. The value for me of giving this offer away would be 852-561 = 291. This is less than my outside option of 415, so I shouldn't make that offer.\n\nThus, the prior offer is the best one.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the optimal action for Player 2.\n\nThe current offer is [3, 1, 2, 2, 3], which means Player 1 is offering me:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nMy values are:\n- item 1: 91\n- item 2: 96\n- item 3: 30\n- item 4: 35\n- item 5: 100\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(3 * 91) + (1 * 96) + (2 * 30) + (2 * 35) + (3 * 100) = 273 + 96 + 60 + 70 + 300 = 799\n\nMy outside offer is 1055.  Since 799 is less than 1055, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow let's consider a counteroffer. Since this is round 1, and there are 3 rounds, the discount factor is significant. I want to try and maximize my outcome. To determine a good counteroffer, I need to know the total amount of resources that are available.\n- Item 1: 6 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 5 units\nI need to decide on the best split.\nSince my outside offer is 1055, I want an offer that gets me close to that, but leaves enough value for Player 1 that they will accept. Let's try to get at least half of my max value, discounted by the discount factor.\n1433 * 0.5 * 0.9^0 = 716.5. This is much lower than my outside offer.\nLet's assume I keep 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This translates to offering the other player:\nItem 1: 2 units, item 2: 1 unit, item 3: 2 units, item 4: 2 units, item 5: 2 units.\nMy value is: 4*91 + 1*96 + 1*30 + 1*35 + 3*100 = 364 + 96 + 30 + 35 + 300 = 825\n\nI can try to offer [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My value then is 4 * 91 + 2 * 96 + 3 * 30 + 3 * 35 + 5 * 100 = 364 + 192 + 90 + 105 + 500 = 1251.\nLet's try to offer [0,0,0,0,0]. Then I have 6 * 91 + 2 * 96 + 3 * 30 + 3 * 35 + 5 * 100 = 546 + 192 + 90 + 105 + 500 = 1433.\n\nSince my outside offer is 1055, let's try to aim for 1172 (1055/0.9).\n\nI am going to make a counteroffer that secures me a higher value than my outside option, while also giving the other player something of value. Since my values for item 1 and item 5 are very high, I'd prefer to keep as much of them as possible. Let's try offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I keep [5, 1, 2, 2, 4]. My value is 5*91 + 1*96 + 2*30 + 2*35 + 4*100 = 455 + 96 + 60 + 70 + 400 = 1081. This beats my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 2 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

So the total value of this offer to me is:\n\n(1 * 56) + (1 * 47) + (1 * 44) + (1 * 75) + (1 * 13) = 56 + 47 + 44 + 75 + 13 = 235\n\nSince it's round 2, this value is discounted by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So the present value of accepting this offer is 235 * 0.9 = 211.5\n\nMy outside offer is 415. Since 211.5 < 415, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, I need to consider making a counteroffer. To make a smart counteroffer, I need to figure out what Player 2 wants and how much they value each item. However, I don't know their values. Therefore, let's try to get as much as possible and still be better than walking away. Since Player 2 offered [1,1,1,1,1], they might value the items quite evenly.\n\nLet's calculate my value if I offer them half of everything. That would mean I offer them:\n\n* Item 1: 3 units\n* Item 2: 1 units\n* Item 3: 1.5 units\n* Item 4: 1.5 units\n* Item 5: 2.5 units\n\nSince I can't offer partial units, I will offer them:\n* Item 1: 3 units\n* Item 2: 1 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 3 units\n\nThis means I keep:\n* Item 1: 3 units\n* Item 2: 1 units\n* Item 3: 1 units\n* Item 4: 1 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\n\nThe value of keeping these items is (3 * 56) + (1 * 47) + (1 * 44) + (1 * 75) + (2 * 13) = 168 + 47 + 44 + 75 + 26 = 360.\n\nDiscounted value: 360 * 0.9 = 324. This is still below my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering slightly less: [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nThis means I keep:\n* Item 1: 4 units\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 3 units\n\nThe value of keeping these items is (4 * 56) + (2 * 47) + (2 * 44) + (2 * 75) + (3 * 13) = 224 + 94 + 88 + 150 + 39 = 595\n\nDiscounted value: 595 * 0.9 = 535.5.

This suggests that player 1 wants items 2 and 5 more than the others and I want item 1, 2, 5 more than the others. Given that the values are from 1 to 101, let's consider offering them just enough so that their total value is higher than mine will be if I keep what's left.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 half of everything [3, 1, 1, 1, 2] or [3, 1, 2, 2, 3] (their round 1 offer to me)\nIf I offer them [3, 1, 2, 2, 3] I keep [3, 1, 1, 1, 2]. Value to me = 3*91 + 1*96 + 1*30 + 1*35 + 2*100 = 273 + 96 + 30 + 35 + 200 = 634. My value is 634 * 0.9 = 570.6\nThis is much worse than my outside offer. I would need to ensure player 1 offers me a deal with value *0.9 that exceeds 1055. Meaning a deal that gets me at least 1172.22.\nGiven that this is round 2, it is unlikely that player 1 will suddenly offer me more value than my outside offer.

I have an outside offer of 803.\n\nMy values for the items are:\nItem 1: 66 (1 unit available)\nItem 2: 72 (2 units available)\nItem 3: 52 (4 units available)\nItem 4: 72 (1 unit available)\nItem 5: 89 (4 units available)\n\nTotal possible value for me: (1 * 66) + (2 * 72) + (4 * 52) + (1 * 72) + (4 * 89) = 66 + 144 + 208 + 72 + 356 = 846\n\nSince this is round 1, and I go first, I need to make an offer to Player 2. I want to make an offer that Player 2 is likely to accept, but also gives me a good share of the items. I need to estimate Player 2's values to figure out a good offer. Since their values are drawn from the same distribution as mine (1 to 101), and I don't know anything else about them, my best strategy is to try and claim a bit more of the value for myself.\n\nA reasonable approach is to offer Player 2 slightly more than half the total value, if they had the same item values as me. Let's say I offer them half. Half the total value is 846/2 = 423. Let's round up to 425 to entice them.\n\nI want to give them items that I value less. Let's start by giving them all of item 3 (4 * 52 = 208), and then give them items 1, 2, 4, and 5 until the total is around 425. I will prioritize giving them the items I value least.\n\n4 units of item 3: 4 * 52 = 208\n1 unit of item 1: 1 * 66 = 66. Running total = 274.\n1 unit of item 2: 1 * 72 = 72. Running total = 346.\n0 units of item 4: 0 * 72 = 0. Running total = 346.\n1 unit of item 5: 1 * 89 = 89. Running total = 435.\n\nSo an offer of [1, 1, 4, 0, 1] to Player 2 would give them approximately a value of 435 if they valued the items the same as me.\n\nNow, I need to calculate what the resulting value is for me if this is accepted. I would keep:\n0 units of item 1: 0 * 66 = 0\n1 units of item 2: 1 * 72 = 72\n0 units of item 3: 0 * 52 = 0\n1 units of item 4: 1 * 72 = 72\n3 units of item 5: 3 * 89 = 267\nMy total: 0 + 72 + 0 + 72 + 267 = 411\n\nThis is much less than my outside option of 803. I need to improve this.\n\nHow about offering: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]. Then I have:\nItem 1: 1 * 66 = 66\nItem 2: 2 * 72 = 144\nItem 3: 2 * 52 = 104\nItem 4: 1 * 72 = 72\nItem 5: 4 * 89 = 356\nTotal: 66 + 144 + 104 + 72 + 356 = 742\nPlayer 2 gets: 2 * 52 = 104\n\nThis is bad too. I must get more.\nLet's try offering only item 3 to player 2.\nIf I offer [0, 0, 4, 0, 0], then my value becomes:\n66 + 144 + 0 + 72 + 356 = 638\nPlayer 2 gets: 4 * their value.\n\nLet's offer nothing. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThen my value is 846.\nPlayer 2 gets: 0\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

A simple approach is to offer Player 2 half the value of all the items. Since I value all the items at 535, I can aim to keep a value of 267.5 for myself (and offer the rest to player 2), or rather to give items worth ~267.5 to player 2. I should try to be a little more strategic though and give away the items I value the least.\n\nLet's consider offering all of item 4 (value: 3 * 5 = 15) and all of item 1 (value: 3 * 11 = 33).

Since 681 > 259, accepting the current offer is better than walking away immediately.\n\nHowever, I can consider making a counteroffer to potentially get even more value. Let's think about what Player 1 might value. Since I don't know their values, I should aim for a relatively fair split to increase the chance of them accepting. A simple strategy is to propose an even split of the items.\n\nTotal items:\n- Item 1: 4\n- Item 2: 5\n- Item 3: 5\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 3\n\nAn even split would be:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 2.5\n- Item 3: 2.5\n- Item 4: 0.5\n- Item 5: 1.5\n\nSince we can only deal in whole numbers, let's adjust this slightly in Player 1's favor to make it more appealing to them while still significantly improving my offer:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThis counteroffer gives Player 1: [2, 3, 3, 1, 2]\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be:\n(2 * 98) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 86) + (0 * 94) + (1 * 77) = 196 + 142 + 172 + 0 + 77 = 587\n\nI made a calculation mistake when considering what to give the other player and keep for myself.\n\nMy value for the current offer is 681, exceeding my outside offer of 259. Since this is Round 1, I have the opportunity to try and improve the deal further. Let's calculate the items I would get:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy values:\n- Item 1: 98\n- Item 2: 71\n- Item 3: 86\n- Item 4: 94\n- Item 5: 77\n\nTotal value: 2 * 98 + 2 * 71 + 2 * 86 + 1 * 94 + 1 * 77 = 196 + 142 + 172 + 94 + 77 = 681\n\nLet's try and improve this a little, by offering:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 3\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 2\n\nThis counteroffer gives Player 1: [1, 3, 3, 1, 2]\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 1\n\nMy value would be:\n(3 * 98) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 86) + (0 * 94) + (1 * 77) = 294 + 142 + 172 + 0 + 77 = 685\n\nThis is not enough of an improvement to be worth risking the negotiation.

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, but I also need to consider Player 2's potential outside offer and their unknown item values.\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's values, I'll start with an offer that gives them a significant portion of the items while still ensuring I get at least my outside offer value if they accept. I'll aim for a split that gives me slightly more than my outside offer, hoping they'll accept rather than risk getting less with their outside offer.\n\nHere's my strategy:\n\n1.  Calculate the total value of all items to me:\n    *   Item 1: 4 * 100 = 400\n    *   Item 2: 7 * 100 = 700\n    *   Item 3: 4 * 92 = 368\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 20 = 20\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 39 = 156\n    *   Total value = 400 + 700 + 368 + 20 + 156 = 1644\n\n2.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means Player 1 gets [3, 2, 2, 2, 2] units.\n\nMy values are:\nItem 1: 98\nItem 2: 95\nItem 3: 9\nItem 4: 8\nItem 5: 58\n\nThe value of the current offer to me is:\n(2 * 98) + (0 * 95) + (2 * 9) + (2 * 8) + (1 * 58) = 196 + 0 + 18 + 16 + 58 = 288\n\nMy outside offer is 854. Since 288 < 854, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, taking into account the discount factor of 0.9 and the risk of walking away in later rounds. Since this is round 1, I have the most bargaining power. My goal is to get as close to my ideal outcome as possible while still giving Player 1 enough to accept.\n\nOne possible counteroffer is to give Player 1 only the minimum necessary to make them better off than their outside option. However, I don't know Player 1's values or outside option. A safe approach in round 1 is to aim for a roughly equal split, or slightly skewed in my favour given I know my outside option.\n\nLet's start by proposing I get close to all of Items 1, 2 and 5, but still give the other player some, as I know I want a fair amount of each item.\n\nCounteroffer proposal: I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]. This means I would receive [4, 1, 2, 2, 2].\nMy value would be: (4*98) + (1*95) + (2*9) + (2*8) + (2*58) = 392 + 95 + 18 + 16 + 116 = 637.\n\nIf I get all of Items 1, 2 and 5, my value would be:\n(5 * 98) + (2 * 95) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 8) + (3 * 58) = 490 + 190 + 0 + 0 + 174 = 854.\nBut, if I offered [0, 0, 4, 4, 0] as my offer, that would mean I would get the rest [5, 2, 0, 0, 3] which is worth (5 * 98) + (2 * 95) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 8) + (3 * 58) = 490 + 190 + 174 = 854. This matches my outside option, so I should aim for that.\n\nI'll offer the other player the following: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0]. This means I keep [5, 2, 0, 0, 3]. This is equivalent to my outside option. If they reject, I can accept in round 2 and get 90% of this.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 4, 0]}\n```",

If I offer Player 2 too much, I'll be worse off than my outside offer. If I offer too little, Player 2 will walk away, and I'll get my outside offer. So I want to offer them something that makes them roughly indifferent between accepting and their unknown outside offer.\n\nLet's consider an equal split as a starting point, or some allocation that might seem fair.\n\n*   **Item 1:** 3 units total. Offer Player 2 1 unit. Keep 2 units for myself: 2 * 80 = 160.\n*   **Item 2:** 3 units total. Offer Player 2 1 unit. Keep 2 units for myself: 2 * 39 = 78.\n*   **Item 3:** 0 units total.

Offer Player 2 0 units. Keep 1 unit for myself: 1 * 9 = 9.\n\nTotal value for me: 160 + 78 + 0 + 21 + 9 = 268. This is better than my outside offer of 226.\n\nLet's try to improve this offer a bit.\nOffer: [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n\nSince there's no negotiation history and no information about Player 2, let's be a little more generous and aim for something that still exceeds my outside offer while giving Player 2 a decent share.\n* Item 1: Give 1, keep 2\n* Item 2: Give 1, keep 2\n* Item 3: Give 0, keep 0\n* Item 4: Give 4, keep 2\n* Item 5: Give 0, keep 1\n\nThis yields me: 2*80 + 2*39 + 0*28 + 2*7 + 1*9 = 160 + 78 + 0 + 14 + 9 = 261\n\nLet's try another offer:\n*   **Item 1:** Give 1. Keep 2. 2*80 = 160\n*   **Item 2:** Give 2. Keep 1. 1*39 = 39\n*   **Item 3:** Give 0. Keep 0. 0*28 = 0\n*   **Item 4:** Give 3. Keep 3. 3*7 = 21\n*   **Item 5:** Give 0. Keep 1. 1*9 = 9\n\nTotal value = 160 + 39 + 0 + 21 + 9 = 229\n\nThis is barely above the outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. The current offer on the table is [1, 1, 0, 4, 0], meaning Player 1 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are:\n- Item 1: 13\n- Item 2: 46\n- Item 3: 69\n- Item 4: 92\n- Item 5: 61\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 13) + (1 * 46) + (0 * 69) + (4 * 92) + (0 * 61) = 13 + 46 + 0 + 368 + 0 = 427\n\nMy outside offer is 673. Since 427 is less than 673, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To maximize my value, I want to keep as much of the items with high values as possible (items 3 and 4), while offering Player 1 more of the items with lower values. I need to give Player 1 at least something that makes it better for them than their outside offer. I don't know their values, so I'll start by offering a split that seems somewhat fair, then adjust in later rounds if necessary.\n\nI have the following amounts of each item:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 6\n- Item 5: 1\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 half of the items that I have, rounding up where necessary.\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 1\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 0\n\nThe value of this outcome to me would be:\n(1 * 13) + (1 * 46) + (0 * 69) + (3 * 92) + (0 * 61) = 13 + 46 + 0 + 276 + 0 = 335\n\nSince 335 is lower than my outside option, I need a better counteroffer to be better off. The counteroffer [2,2,0,3,1] is also not good compared to my outside offer of 673.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1 more item 1 and item 2. Let's try offering them all of item 1 and item 2 and keeping most of the other high value items.\n\nCounteroffer: [3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis would give me:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 6\nItem 5: 1\n\nValue to me: (0 * 13) + (0 * 46) + (0 * 69) + (6 * 92) + (1 * 61) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 552 + 61 = 613\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 673. I need to consider the discount factor in future rounds. However, since this is round 1, gamma^0 = 1, so it doesn't affect the calculations.\n\nSince I can't find a counteroffer that gives me more than my outside offer right now, I should walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's break down this negotiation problem.\n\n**Understanding the Situation:**\n\n*   **My Goal:** Maximize my discounted value from the negotiation, but never below my outside offer of 366.\n*   **Items:** 5 types of items with limited quantities (5, 2, 3, 3, 3).\n*   **My Values:** I know my private values for each item (23, 54, 62, 83, 58).\n*   **Player 2:** I don't know Player 2's values or outside offer. This is a crucial element of uncertainty.\n*   **Discount:** The discount factor (0.9) means getting a deal done sooner is better.\n*   **Rounds:** 3 rounds to negotiate.\n*   **Current Round:** Round 1, I go first.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Immediate Walk Option:** Walking away immediately guarantees me 366. I need any counteroffer to be *likely* to yield a value greater than 366 *after* considering the discount factor.\n2.  **Estimating Player 2's Values:** Since Player 2's values are uniformly distributed between 1 and 101, the average value is 51. A simple strategy might involve starting with a reasonably generous offer, based on my own values, and then adjusting based on Player 2's response.\n3.  **Initial Offer Strategy:** I need to decide what to offer Player 2. Let's try to aim for an equal split of the total value, and adjust from there. Since I don't know Player 2's valuations, I want to make an offer that they will accept and that is also better for me than walking away.\n\nLet's start by giving Player 2 slightly more than half of each item, based on *my* values, but also taking into account that items 1-5 are available in quantities of 5, 2, 3, 3, 3, respectively.\n\n*   Offer Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n\n*   Calculate what this offer means for *me*:\n\n    *   Item 1: I keep 2 units. 2 * 23 = 46\n    *   Item 2: I keep 1 unit. 1 * 54 = 54\n    *   Item 3: I keep 1 unit. 1 * 62 = 62\n    *   Item 4: I keep 1 unit. 1 * 83 = 83\n    *   Item 5: I keep 1 unit. 1 * 58 = 58\n    *   Total value for me: 46 + 54 + 62 + 83 + 58 = 303\n\nThis is lower than walking away immediately (366).\n\nLet's try a slightly less generous offer, giving Player 2 just under half of the total value (based on *my* values).\n\n*   Offer Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\n*   Calculate what this offer means for *me*:\n\n    *   Item 1: I keep 3 units. 3 * 23 = 69\n    *   Item 2: I keep 1 unit. 1 * 54 = 54\n    *   Item 3: I keep 2 units. 2 * 62 = 124\n    *   Item 4: I keep 2 units. 2 * 83 = 166\n    *   Item 5: I keep 2 units. 2 * 58 = 116\n    *   Total value for me: 69 + 54 + 124 + 166 + 116 = 529\n\nThis is larger than 366, my outside offer.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

I want to maximize my value, so I need to figure out what Player 1's values are likely to be. Since I don't know Player 1's values, a reasonable strategy is to try and get close to my outside option while making the offer attractive for Player 1 given they also have some private outside option.\nI will ask for:\nItem 1: Keep all 5\nItem 2: Keep all 2\nItem 3: Keep all 3\nItem 4: Keep all 3\nItem 5: Keep all 3\n\nThis means I offer Player 1 nothing. The offer to player 1 is [0,0,0,0,0].\nMy value for this would be: (5 * 65) + (2 * 33) + (3 * 66) + (3 * 35) + (3 * 16) = 325 + 66 + 198 + 105 + 48 = 742.\n\nNow let's try to come up with a counteroffer that would give me at least my outside option, 688. If I offer player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], I keep [4, 2, 3, 3, 3]. This would give me (4*65) + (2*33) + (3*66) + (3*35) + (3*16) = 260 + 66 + 198 + 105 + 48 = 677.

This is greater than 688.\n\nTherefore, I'll make a counteroffer that ensures my value is greater than my outside offer.

Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means 1 unit of item 1, and nothing of the other items.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n1 unit of item 1 * 65 = 65\nTotal value of the offer = 65\n\nNow, let's consider my outside offer, which is 688. Since the value of the current offer (65) is much less than my outside offer, and we are in round 2 (discount factor is 0.9), accepting now doesn't make sense.\n\nMy previous counteroffer was [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Player 1 countered with [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nI need to decide whether to walk, accept, or make another counteroffer. Walking would give me 688. Accepting would give me 65.  Making a counteroffer has the risk that Player 1 will walk, or offer me something even worse next round.\n\nLet's try to determine a counteroffer that would be acceptable to me and might be accepted by Player 1. I want to get at least my outside offer value, adjusted for the round's discount factor. That value would be 688 / 0.9 = 764.4444...\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1 something that's attractive to them, but still allows me to get a good amount of value.\nLet's aim to keep at least 765 worth of items for myself after the counteroffer. The total value of all items to me is 742, so I will want all items.\n\nLet's consider giving player 1 [3, 1, 1, 1, 1]. That means I would get:\n2 units of item 1 = 2 * 65 = 130\n1 units of item 2 = 1 * 33 = 33\n2 units of item 3 = 2 * 66 = 132\n2 units of item 4 = 2 * 35 = 70\n2 units of item 5 = 2 * 16 = 32\nTotal Value = 130 + 33 + 132 + 70 + 32 = 397\n\nThis result is much lower than 765. It will not work. It would be less than my outside option of 688, after considering the discount rate.\n\nLet's try another counteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nI keep:\n5 units of item 1 = 5 * 65 = 325\n2 units of item 2 = 2 * 33 = 66\n3 units of item 3 = 3 * 66 = 198\n3 units of item 4 = 3 * 35 = 105\n3 units of item 5 = 3 * 16 = 48\nTotal Value = 325 + 66 + 198 + 105 + 48 = 742. After discount factor, this is 742 * 0.9 = 667.8. That is still not high enough.\n\nSince I can't seem to get a good outcome by negotiating, I will choose my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

My goal is to maximize my value, considering my outside offer of 781 and the discount factor of 0.9 in later rounds.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total value of all items for me:\n4 * 95 + 4 * 16 + 3 * 77 + 4 * 85 + 4 * 97 = 380 + 64 + 231 + 340 + 388 = 1403\n\nI want to make an offer that Player 2 is likely to accept, or at least counter, giving me a chance to negotiate. If I offer too little, Player 2 will walk away, and I'll get my outside offer of 781. If I offer too much, I'll be giving away value unnecessarily.\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's values, a reasonable starting point is to aim for an even split of the total value.  Since I value the items at 1403, an even split would be around 701.5 for each of us. However, I need to offer something that reflects Player 2's potential valuations, not mine. To increase the chances of player 2 accepting the deal, I will give them a generous split of each item. I'll start by giving Player 2 more than half of each item, biasing towards my lower-valued items, and holding more of my high-valued items.\n\nLet's try the following offer to Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nMy value for this would be:\n2 * 95 + 2 * 16 + 1 * 77 + 2 * 85 + 2 * 97 = 190 + 32 + 77 + 170 + 194 = 663\n\nThis is less than my outside offer, so I need to sweeten the deal for myself to at least beat my outside offer.

My outside offer is 164. Since 215 > 164, I am better off accepting the offer than walking away *right now*.\n\nHowever, this is only round 1, and I need to consider the discount factor in future rounds. If I reject this offer, I can make a counteroffer. It is possible that a counteroffer could give me an even better outcome, *even considering the discount factor*. I also don't know Player 1's values, so I don't know their best outcome, and thus whether they would accept my counteroffer or not. If there's no agreement, then both players receive their outside offers. Since my outside offer is 164, then if my counteroffer does not get accepted by Player 1, I get 164 after 3 rounds, which gives me a discounted value of 164 * (0.9^2) = 164 * 0.81 = 132.84\n\nSo the question becomes, can I make a counteroffer that will give me value greater than the current offer of 215 *OR* greater than the discounted walk-away value of 132.84? Since my value is greater now by taking the current offer, let's try a greedy strategy.\nPlayer 1 has offered me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], so they are keeping [3, 3, 2, 3, 3].\nMy values are: 89, 7, 10, 68, 41.\nI have 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I take everything I value high, and offer Player 1 everything I value low.\nI really value item 1 and item 4. Let's try offering player 1 items 2, 3, and 5. My current offer is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nWhat if I give them [0, 4, 3, 0, 4]? This means I am keeping [4, 0, 0, 4, 0]. My value would be 4*89 + 4*68 = 356 + 272 = 628\nThis is much higher than the original 215, so that could be a good choice if Player 1 accepts.\n\nAnother counteroffer: I offer Player 1 only item 2 and item 3 so [0, 4, 3, 0, 0]\nThis would mean I keep [4, 0, 0, 4, 4]. My value would be 4*89 + 4*68 + 4*41 = 356 + 272 + 164 = 792.\nThis is even higher.\n\nFinal Counteroffer: Since this is only Round 1 and I don't know Player 1's values yet, it's possible I could push them to a better offer for myself in Round 2.\nSo I will offer them the absolute minimum, just in case. My counteroffer to them is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything.\nValue for me would be 4*89 + 4*7 + 3*10 + 4*68 + 4*41 = 356 + 28 + 30 + 272 + 164 = 850\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means Player 2 would keep all the items. I should have walked, since keeping all items is not rational.\n\n**Round 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   Current offer to me: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get nothing, and Player 2 gets everything. This is worth 0 to me.\n*   My outside offer: 781\n*   Remaining rounds: 2 (including this round). Discount factor: 0.9\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth 0 to me, it's far below my outside offer of 781. I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer.\n\nIf I walk away, I get 781.\n\nIf I make a counteroffer, I need to estimate what Player 2 might accept. Their first offer suggests they value the items quite highly.\n\nLet's consider a few options:\n\n1.  **Accepting the current offer:** Value = 0\n2.  **Walking Away:** Value = 781\n3.  **Counteroffer:** This is the tricky part.\n\nSince I know that the total value of the items to me is 1403, an even split would give each of us 701.5. My outside offer is 781.\n\nI made a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] in the first round, which equates to a value of 1033 to me. This was not accepted. Perhaps it was too greedy.\nLet me try to counteroffer a more \"fair\" amount. Say, giving them half of the items where possible. [2,2,1,2,2]. This would yield me:\n2 * 95 + 2 * 16 + 2 * 85 + 2 * 97 = 190 + 32 + 170 + 194 = 586\n1 * 77 = 77\nTotal = 586 + 77 = 663. This is less than my walk away, so that won't do.\n\nLet me offer them [1,1,0,1,0].\nThis would be value 3 * 95 + 3 * 16 + 3 * 85 + 4 * 77 + 4 * 97\n= 285 + 48 + 255 + 308 + 388 = 1284.\nThat sounds good.\n\nI am going to offer them just a little and see what they say [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nThis leaves me with 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4 and 3 of item 5 for myself. The value of this offer to me is:\n    *   3 * 95 + 3 * 16 + 2 * 77 + 3 * 85 + 3 * 97 = 285 + 48 + 154 + 255 + 291 = 1033\nAnd I get 0.9 * 1033 = 929.7 which is above my walk away of 781, so I will do that.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

However, given that it is round 2 and only one round remains, my primary consideration should be whether or not I can obtain a value greater than my walkaway value in round 3.\n\nI think I should counteroffer to see if I can get a better value than the outside offer, discounted by 0.9.\n\nLet's try to offer player 1 roughly half of everything.\nItem 1: offer 0, keep 1.\nItem 2: offer 1, keep 1.\nItem 3: offer 1, keep 1.\nItem 4: offer 0, keep 1.\nItem 5: offer 2, keep 3.\n\nMy value for this would be:\n(1 * 65) + (1 * 72) + (1 * 22) + (1 * 45) + (3 * 44) = 65 + 72 + 22 + 45 + 132 = 336\nDiscounted by 0.9 it will become 302.4.\nThis is larger than my outside offer.\n\nSo the offer would be [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]}\n",

Therefore, accepting is a good option so far.\n\nHowever, before accepting, let's consider if I can make a counteroffer that would be even more beneficial. The key is to figure out if there's a distribution of items that Player 2 would likely accept, and that would give me an even higher value than 637.2.\n\nSince I have 6 units of item 1, 3 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 6 of item 5, and Player 2's offer to me is [2, 2, 0, 6, 0], this means I would be giving Player 2 [4, 1, 0, 0, 6].\n\nLet's see if a slight adjustment could result in a win/win. Item 5 is my highest-valued item, and I'm currently giving away all 6 of them. Item 4 is something I value at 67, and I'm getting all 6. I might be able to give up a unit or two of item 4 and keep a unit of item 5 to benefit.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I give Player 2 [4, 1, 0, 1, 5]. This means I keep [2, 2, 0, 5, 1].\nMy value for [2, 2, 0, 5, 1] is:\n2 * 97 + 2 * 56 + 0 * 6 + 5 * 67 + 1 * 82 = 194 + 112 + 0 + 335 + 82 = 723\nApplying discount rate: 723 * 0.9 = 650.7\n\nIt's a small improvement over accepting the current offer. It may be acceptable to player 2, since they are getting almost the same.\n\nGiven the potential for a slightly better outcome with minimal risk, I'll make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 0, 1, 5]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [4, 1, 0, 1, 5]. This means they get the rest of the items. I need to calculate the value of this offer to me and compare it to my outside offer, considering the discount factor.\n\nMy values are: 29 for item 1, 76 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 34 for item 4, 88 for item 5.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 * 29 = 116\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 76 = 76\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 * 43 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 34 = 34\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 * 88 = 440\n\nTotal value of the offer to me: 116 + 76 + 0 + 34 + 440 = 666\n\nSince it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of the current offer to me is 666 * 0.9 = 599.4\n\nMy outside offer is 691. Since 599.4 < 691, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. The game ends in the next round even if I offer something. So I want to get at least as much as my outside offer value. This is difficult, but it is worth trying a counteroffer to see if player 1 is willing to accept it.\n\nTo construct a potential counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 1 might value. Since I don't know their values, I will try to improve my position by giving them items they currently have a lot of, and keeping items I value more, but they offered me little. It would be ideal if the values are similar for both of us.\n\nI have 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 available in total.\nPlayer 1 offered me [4, 1, 0, 1, 5]. This means they wanted [2, 2, 0, 5, 1].\n\nI will construct a counteroffer to give them [2, 2, 0, 4, 1], which would mean I get [4, 1, 0, 2, 5].\n\nValue of counteroffer for me:\n- 4 * 29 + 1 * 76 + 0 * 43 + 2 * 34 + 5 * 88 = 116 + 76 + 0 + 68 + 440 = 700\n\nPresent value: 700 * 0.9 = 630\n\nI will improve this a little by giving [2, 2, 0, 3, 1], so I can get [4, 1, 0, 3, 5] and then it will be:\n- 4 * 29 + 1 * 76 + 0 * 43 + 3 * 34 + 5 * 88 = 116 + 76 + 0 + 102 + 440 = 734\nPresent value: 734 * 0.9 = 660.6. Still less than 691.\n\nSince the next round is the last one, it is optimal to make a counteroffer that gives as much value as possible to Player 1. I can improve my chance of a deal by offering player 1 more item 4.\n\nSo I will offer [2, 2, 0, 3, 1] because I think there may be a slight chance that the other player has low value for item 4.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 3, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [1, 1, 0, 0, 1], meaning I get:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 1 unit of item 2\n* 0 units of item 3\n* 0 units of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy values for these items are:\n* Item 1: 57\n* Item 2: 32\n* Item 3: 67\n* Item 4: 24\n* Item 5: 85\n\nSo the value of the current offer to me is: (1 * 57) + (1 * 32) + (0 * 67) + (0 * 24) + (1 * 85) = 57 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 85 = 174\n\nMy outside offer is 675. Since 174 is much less than 675, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow let's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I need to keep as much of the valuable items (3 and 5) as possible. I also need to give the other player *something* to make a deal worthwhile for them. A reasonable approach is to try to equalize the distribution a bit.\n\nAvailable items:\n* Item 1: 4 units\n* Item 2: 5 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 3 units\n* Item 5: 6 units\n\nA possible counteroffer is to give Player 1 half of everything where possible, rounding up or down to the nearest whole unit. So, offering Player 1 [2, 2, 1, 1, 3]. This means I would keep:\n* Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n* Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3\n* Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n* Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n* Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3\n\nMy value for this would be:\n(2 * 57) + (3 * 32) + (1 * 67) + (2 * 24) + (3 * 85) = 114 + 96 + 67 + 48 + 255 = 580\n\nSince 580 < 675, this counteroffer is also not worth it to me at the current discount factor of 1. However, if it gets closer to the final round, accepting a lower value may be necessary due to the discount factor impacting the outside option as well.\n\nFor now, it's better to walk away and take the guaranteed outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, considering my outside offer of 695 and the discount factor of 0.9.\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's values, a good starting strategy is to aim for an even split, modified to account for the different quantities of items. Let's see what an approximately even split looks like and calculate its value to me.\n\n*   Item 1: I have 3 units. Giving Player 2 1.5 (round to 2) leaves me with 1. Value: 1 * 49 = 49\n*   Item 2: I have 5 units. Giving Player 2 2.5 (round to 3) leaves me with 2. Value: 2 * 8 = 16\n*   Item 3: I have 1 unit. Giving Player 2 0.5 (round to 1) leaves me with 0. Value: 0 * 7 = 0\n*   Item 4: I have 5 units. Giving Player 2 2.5 (round to 3) leaves me with 2. Value: 2 * 59 = 118\n*   Item 5: I have 7 units. Giving Player 2 3.5 (round to 4) leaves me with 3. Value: 3 * 99 = 297\n\nTotal value to me: 49 + 16 + 0 + 118 + 297 = 480\n\nSince 480 is less than my outside option, aiming for a better deal is imperative. Let's adjust the offer to be more favorable to me. I'll give Player 2 less of the items I value highly (Items 4 and 5) and more of the items I value lowly (Items 2 and 3).\n\nRevised offer:\n*   Item 1: Give Player 2 1. Value to me: 2 * 49 = 98\n*   Item 2: Give Player 2 4. Value to me: 1 * 8 = 8\n*   Item 3: Give Player 2 1. Value to me: 0 * 7 = 0\n*   Item 4: Give Player 2 2. Value to me: 3 * 59 = 177\n*   Item 5: Give Player 2 3. Value to me: 4 * 99 = 396\n\nTotal Value: 98 + 8 + 0 + 177 + 396 = 679\n\nThis is still below my outside offer. I need to be more aggressive. I'm going to make a counteroffer where I keep most of items 4 and 5.\n\nNew Offer:\n*   Item 1: Give Player 2 1. Value to me: 2 * 49 = 98\n*   Item 2: Give Player 2 4. Value to me: 1 * 8 = 8\n*   Item 3: Give Player 2 1. Value to me: 0 * 7 = 0\n*   Item 4: Give Player 2 1. Value to me: 4 * 59 = 236\n*   Item 5: Give Player 2 2. Value to me: 5 * 99 = 495\n\nTotal Value: 98 + 8 + 0 + 236 + 495 = 837\n\nThis is above my outside offer.

Since 842.4 > 551, accepting Player 2's offer is better than walking away *right now*.\n\nHowever, Player 1's first offer was [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]. This would give me:\n1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\nValue of Player 1's offer to me:\n(1 * 45) + (3 * 70) + (4 * 77) + (1 * 8) + (2 * 24) = 45 + 210 + 308 + 8 + 48 = 619\nDiscounted value of Player 1's offer: 619 * 0.9 = 557.1.\n\nPlayer 2 offered me nothing. I'm not sure what the other player's values are, but I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal than accepting Player 2's current offer (which is equivalent to me getting everything). I'll try to get at least a bit more than my outside option (551) after discounting.\n\nI will offer Player 2 slightly more than before, but still leaning strongly in my favor.\nI will offer Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nThis leaves me with: 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\nValue to me: (2 * 45) + (3 * 70) + (5 * 77) + (2 * 8) + (2 * 24) = 90 + 210 + 385 + 16 + 48 = 749\nDiscounted Value: 749 * 0.9 = 674.1\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside option.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My values are 84, 48, 62, 15, 91 per unit.\n\nThe value of this offer to me is:\n(0 * 84) + (1 * 48) + (1 * 62) + (2 * 15) + (1 * 91) = 0 + 48 + 62 + 30 + 91 = 231\n\nSince it is round 2, we must multiply our value by gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nTherefore, the present value of this offer is 231 * 0.9 = 207.9\n\nMy outside offer is worth 809.\n\nSince 207.9 < 809, accepting this offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer. I need to decide whether to WALK away or make a COUNTEROFFER. This is the second round. If I make a counteroffer and it is rejected in round 3 (the final round), I'll end up walking away with my outside offer. If I make a counteroffer that is accepted in this round, I will get gamma^(r-1) multiplied by my value from the items.\n\nThe total units available are 2, 4, 6, 4, 3 for items 1 through 5. The total units Player 1 is offering to me is [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]. That means Player 1 will have [2, 3, 5, 2, 2]. My values for the items are [84, 48, 62, 15, 91] and Player 1's current value is [2*84 + 3*48 + 5*62 + 2*15 + 2*91] = [168 + 144 + 310 + 30 + 182] = 834.\n\nI believe I can make a counteroffer which Player 1 will accept and that will net me more than 809 * (1/0.9). This would require that the value of the offer to me is > 809 / .9 = 898.\n\nTo make this offer, Player 1 would need a value lower than 834 * (1/0.9) = 926.67.\n\nI should make a counteroffer that is just slightly better for Player 1 than what they will get by walking away.\n\nLet's calculate a reasonable counteroffer. If I offer Player 1 a total value of, say, 400, that is a total value to me of (2*84 + 4*48 + 6*62 + 4*15 + 3*91) - 400 = 1065 - 400 = 665. That, multiplied by 0.9, comes out to 598.5, which is less than my outside offer value of 809.\n\nHowever, if I offered Player 1 their outside value + 1 then they would accept. I don't know their outside value, but I could offer to split it evenly. Half of the items have a value of 532.5.\n\nLet's calculate the value to me if I offer player 1 [1, 2, 3, 2, 1].\nThe value to player 1 would be: [1*84 + 2*48 + 3*62 + 2*15 + 1*91]. This is (84+96+186+30+91) = 487\nThe value to me would be: [1*84 + 2*48 + 3*62 + 2*15 + 2*91]. This is (84+96+186+30+182) = 578\n\nTherefore, the value to me would be 578 * 0.9 = 520.2. This is not better than my outside offer.\n\nI need to offer something that leaves me greater than 809 / 0.9 = 898.\n\nI believe the best action is to walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

So the present value of this offer is 469.\n\nMy outside offer is 760.  Since 469 < 760, accepting the offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while also making it attractive for Player 1 to accept. A simple approach is to aim for a split that gives me slightly more than my outside offer value. However, with 3 rounds of negotiation, I can also aim for a more aggressive counteroffer initially, anticipating further adjustments in later rounds.\n\nLet's try to get closer to an equal split of the total value. The total possible value is (4*25) + (1*54) + (5*6) + (4*43) + (5*87) = 100 + 54 + 30 + 172 + 435 = 791. Half of this would be around 395.5 for each player. Let's craft an offer that aims for me to receive close to 760 (my outside offer) by giving Player 1 more. I need to give Player 1 a value more than what is currently being proposed. Since there is a total possible value of 791, I will offer to give away the amounts that keep my value close to my outside offer of 760, but discounted by some amount.\nIf I get 760, then player 1 gets 31.\n\nTo give player 1 31 value, let us construct the counteroffer:\n[1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nMy value becomes 3*25 + 1*54 + 5*6 + 4*43 + 5*87 = 75+54+30+172+435=766.\nOkay, let me construct a counteroffer such that I keep more of item 5, so I will offer less of this item.\n[2,0,2,2,0]\nThis yields 2*25 + 1*54 + 3*6 + 2*43 + 0*87 = 50 + 54 + 18 + 86 + 0 = 208\nSo if I offer [2, 0, 2, 2, 0] the value to myself becomes 791-208 = 583\nThis is not enough to warrant foregoing the outside option\n\nI will propose to give player 1 1 unit of item 5 for now.\nMy offer: [0,0,0,0,1] to player 1.\nMy value: 4*25 + 1*54 + 5*6 + 4*43 + 4*87 = 100 + 54 + 30 + 172 + 348 = 704\nPlayer 1 will then get 87, well above the 31 margin.\nOk this is too agressive.\n\nBased on my initial calculation, the other player's offer of [2, 0, 2, 2, 2] gives me a value of 469, well below my outside offer of 760.\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that gives me a little over my outside offer discounted.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 792. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 975 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer to me. The current offer is [1, 0, 1, 1, 1], meaning I receive:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 0 units of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy values for these items are 48, 91, 96, 31, and 59, respectively. So the value of the current offer is:\n(1 * 48) + (0 * 91) + (1 * 96) + (1 * 31) + (1 * 59) = 48 + 0 + 96 + 31 + 59 = 234\n\nSince this is round 2, I need to discount this value by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of accepting this offer is 234 * 0.9 = 210.6\n\nMy outside offer is 792. Therefore, accepting the current offer (210.6) is much worse than walking away (792).\n\nNow, let's think about a counteroffer. I need to decide what to offer Player 2 to maximize my own value, considering the possibility that they might reject it.\n\nI'll calculate the total value of all items to me:\n(4 * 48) + (1 * 91) + (5 * 96) + (4 * 31) + (5 * 59) = 192 + 91 + 480 + 124 + 295 = 1182\n\nI want to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 792, taking into account the discount factor of 0.9. This means I want the value I retain to be greater than 792/0.9 = 880.\n\nI also need to keep in mind what player 2 offered in round 1 ([1, 0, 1, 1, 1]). This suggests they value items 1, 3, 4, and 5. Let me try to make an offer where I keep most of item 2 and give player 2 a fair share of other items.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [2, 0, 3, 2, 3]:\n* Item 1: I keep 4 - 2 = 2 units. Value: 2 * 48 = 96\n* Item 2: I keep 1 - 0 = 1 unit. Value: 1 * 91 = 91\n* Item 3: I keep 5 - 3 = 2 units. Value: 2 * 96 = 192\n* Item 4: I keep 4 - 2 = 2 units. Value: 2 * 31 = 62\n* Item 5: I keep 5 - 3 = 2 units. Value: 2 * 59 = 118\nTotal value: 96 + 91 + 192 + 62 + 118 = 559\nDiscounted value: 559 * 0.9 = 503.1.  This is still less than my outside offer of 792.\n\nI need to retain more for myself. Let's try a counteroffer of [1, 0, 2, 1, 2].\n* Item 1: I keep 4 - 1 = 3 units. Value: 3 * 48 = 144\n* Item 2: I keep 1 - 0 = 1 unit. Value: 1 * 91 = 91\n* Item 3: I keep 5 - 2 = 3 units. Value: 3 * 96 = 288\n* Item 4: I keep 4 - 1 = 3 units. Value: 3 * 31 = 93\n* Item 5: I keep 5 - 2 = 3 units. Value: 3 * 59 = 177\nTotal value: 144 + 91 + 288 + 93 + 177 = 793\nDiscounted value: 793 * 0.9 = 713.7 Still below the walkaway.\n\nLet's try [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]:\n* Item 1: I keep 4 units. Value: 4 * 48 = 192\n* Item 2: I keep 1 unit. Value: 1 * 91 = 91\n* Item 3: I keep 4 units. Value: 4 * 96 = 384\n* Item 4: I keep 4 units. Value: 4 * 31 = 124\n* Item 5: I keep 4 units. Value: 4 * 59 = 236\nTotal Value = 192 + 91 + 384 + 124 + 236 = 1027\nDiscounted value = 1027 * 0.9 = 924.3 which is > 792.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

Half of our total value is 871 / 2 = 435.5.\n    *   We need to offer Player 2 enough to make them interested in negotiating, but we don't want to give away too much, especially given our outside option of 391.\n\n4.  **Creating an Initial Offer:** I'll start by offering Player 2 a bit more than half of the items, aiming to get slightly above my outside offer value.

We want to aim higher than this value, and it seems best to go higher on Items where we value the units least.

The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 44 = 44\n*   2 units of item 2: 2 * 70 = 140\n*   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 72 = 72\n*   2 units of item 4: 2 * 64 = 128\n*   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 43 = 43\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 44 + 140 + 72 + 128 + 43 = 427\n\nNow, I need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  So the present value of the current offer is 427 * 0.9 = 384.3.\n\nSince 384.3 is less than my outside offer of 670, accepting this offer would be a bad choice. I need to decide whether to WALK or COUNTEROFFER.\n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer. I need to offer something that gives Player 1 enough value that they might accept it, while maximizing my own value. The total amounts of the items are: 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n\nI will start by calculating my value if I keep everything:\n2*44 + 5*70 + 3*72 + 5*64 + 4*43 = 88 + 350 + 216 + 320 + 172 = 1146\n\nSince there is only one round left after this one, I would want to make an offer that at least gives me more than the outside offer adjusted for the discount factor if it's rejected (which will lead to a walk on round 3). My outside offer value discounted for 2 rounds will be: 670 * 0.9^2 = 543.3\n\nLet's consider offering the other player almost everything. This is risky, but it is better than walking. I will offer the player 1 unit of Item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This means I would keep 1 unit of each. My value would be: 1*44 + 1*70 + 1*72 + 1*64 + 1*43 = 293.\n\nMultiplying by the discount factor this is: 293 * 0.9 = 263.7 which is not enough!\n\nOkay, back to the strategy of making an offer that's better than walking. I will try a modified version of the previous offer.\n\nI will offer [1, 3, 1, 3, 2]. This means I will keep [1, 2, 2, 2, 2].\n\nValue to me: 1*44 + 2*70 + 2*72 + 2*64 + 2*43 = 44 + 140 + 144 + 128 + 86 = 542\n\nDiscounting this becomes: 542 * 0.9 = 487.8 which is still less than 543.3\n\nLet's go back to the idea that I should just accept the current offer, despite it being below my outside option. Perhaps the outside option value is calculated incorrectly and it is based on 1146 * 0.9 = 1031.4\nThen 1031.4 * 0.9 = 928.26\nSince my outside value is 670, I need to accept it if the alternative discounted will fall below this. 427 * 0.9 = 384.3.\n\nThis is the best option, as my calculation for what the payout would be in round 3 seems wrong.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

The remaining items for me are:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units (Value to me: 118)\n*   Item 2: 3 units (Value to me: 96)\n*   Item 3: 3 units (Value to me: 135)\n*   Item 4: 1 unit (Value to me: 75)\n*   Item 5: 1 unit (Value to me: 92)\n\nThis gives me a total value of 118 + 96 + 135 + 75 + 92 = 516. This offer isn't great for me since it is below my outside offer. I need to re-adjust the offer. Let's offer Player 2 a bit less and see if that works.\n\n*   Item 1: 0 unit (Value to me: 0)\n*   Item 2: 2 units (Value to me: 64)\n*   Item 3: 1 units (Value to me: 45)\n*   Item 4: 0 unit (Value to me: 0)\n*   Item 5: 0 unit (Value to me: 0)\n\nThis gives Player 2 a total value of 64 + 45 = 109. The remaining items for me are:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units (Value to me: 177)\n*   Item 2: 4 units (Value to me: 128)\n*   Item 3: 4 units (Value to me: 180)\n*   Item 4: 2 unit (Value to me: 150)\n*   Item 5: 2 unit (Value to me: 184)\n\nThis gives me a total value of 177 + 128 + 180 + 150 + 184 = 819. This is greater than my outside offer. It is also significantly biased towards me. Let's try something in between.\n\n*   Item 1: 1 unit (Value to me: 59)\n*   Item 2: 3 units (Value to me: 96)\n*   Item 3: 2 units (Value to me: 90)\n*   Item 4: 0 unit (Value to me: 0)\n*   Item 5: 0 unit (Value to me: 0)\n\nThis gives Player 2 a total value of 59 + 96 + 90 = 245. The remaining items for me are:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units (Value to me: 118)\n*   Item 2: 3 units (Value to me: 96)\n*   Item 3: 3 units (Value to me: 135)\n*   Item 4: 2 unit (Value to me: 150)\n*   Item 5: 2 unit (Value to me: 184)\n\nThis gives me a total value of 118 + 96 + 135 + 150 + 184 = 683. This is still below my outside offer. Therefore, I will offer the previous offer with total value of 819 for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means Player 2 would get 0 value from the deal *if* Player 2 accepts.\n\n**Possible Actions:**\n\n1.  **ACCEPT:** This would give Player 2 a value of 0. This is worse than the outside offer of 15.\n2.  **WALK:** This would give Player 2 a value of 15.\n3.  **COUNTEROFFER:** This requires careful consideration. Since it's round 2, any deal would be discounted by a factor of 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. If no deal is reached in round 3, the value of Player 2's outside offer remains 15.\n\n**Counteroffer Calculation:**\n\nTo make a counteroffer worthwhile, we need to determine the minimum value Player 2 would need from a deal to beat the outside offer *after* the discount is applied. Let 'x' be the total value Player 2 gets from an allocation of items, then the following condition must hold for a counteroffer to be better than walking away in this round:\n\n0.  9 * x > 15\n\nx > 15 / 0.9\nx > 16.67\n\nSo, we need to ensure we receive at least items with total value of 16.67 to warrant continuing negotiation in this round. This is quite a low amount given the available items so let's try to construct an equitable allocation that also yields value for Player 2 greater than 16.67.\n\nPlayer 1 last offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. It appears that player 1 is aiming to take all the items, so let's propose an allocation of 1/2 of the items for each of us.\nHere's what such an allocation to Player 1 could look like: [1, 3, 2, 1, 1]\nThe number of items left for me would be: [2, 3, 3, 1, 1]\nMy value for this allocation would be:\n(2 * 7) + (3 * 68) + (3 * 19) + (1 * 88) + (1 * 79) = 14 + 204 + 57 + 88 + 79 = 442\n\nSince 442 is significantly greater than 16.67, let's propose this to player 1.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe counteroffer [1, 3, 2, 1, 1] to player 1 leaves player 2 with an allocation worth 442.\nTherefore, 0.9 * 442 = 397.8 > 15.\nSince 397.8 > 15, we are better off making this offer rather than walking away in this round.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, it is round 3. The current offer on the table is [1, 3, 2, 1, 1], which means I receive 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My values for each item are 59, 32, 45, 75, and 92, respectively. My outside offer is 724. The discount factor for this round is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n(1 * 59) + (3 * 32) + (2 * 45) + (1 * 75) + (1 * 92) = 59 + 96 + 90 + 75 + 92 = 412\n\nNow, let's apply the discount factor:\n412 * 0.81 = 333.72\n\nSince 333.72 is less than my outside offer of 724, accepting the current offer would be a bad decision.\n\nI need to decide between walking away and making a counteroffer. Since this is the final round, if I make a counteroffer and Player 2 rejects, I effectively walk away. So, I need to determine if there is any counteroffer that I could make that would be better than walking away. Given that Player 2 has made multiple offers already and we are in the final round, it seems unlikely that I could achieve a deal that significantly exceeds my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will choose to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

I want to maximize my expected value, taking into account the discount factor and my outside offer.\n\nMy ideal scenario is to get all the items. However, Player 2 is unlikely to accept that.\nI need to figure out what offer would be acceptable to Player 2 while still giving me a value greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's start by considering an even split, and then skew it in my favor.

Therefore, this would not be sufficient to be beneficial.\n\nLet's try an offer where I get the majority of the value:\n\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 1\n\nFor Player 2, this offer looks like [0, 2, 2, 1, 1].\n\nMy remaining items:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 5\n- Item 3: 6\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 2\n\nMy value:\n- Item 1: 2 * 86 = 172\n- Item 2: 5 * 43 = 215\n- Item 3: 6 * 54 = 324\n- Item 4: 2 * 70 = 140\n- Item 5: 2 * 51 = 102\n\nTotal value = 172 + 215 + 324 + 140 + 102 = 953\n\nThis is still below my outside offer, however this is round 1. If I make a better offer in a later round it is discounted, and player 2 might walk.\n\nLet's make a slightly better offer for player 2.\n\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 1\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 0\n\nFor Player 2, this offer looks like [0, 1, 1, 0, 0].\n\nMy remaining items:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 6\n- Item 3: 7\n- Item 4: 3\n- Item 5: 3\n\nMy value:\n- Item 1: 2 * 86 = 172\n- Item 2: 6 * 43 = 258\n- Item 3: 7 * 54 = 378\n- Item 4: 3 * 70 = 210\n- Item 5: 3 * 51 = 153\n\nTotal value = 172 + 258 + 378 + 210 + 153 = 1171\n\nThis is above my outside offer, so this is beneficial.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

A good starting point might be an even split, weighted by the number of units for each item.\n\nSo, I will offer:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy value for what I keep would be:\n- Item 1: 2 * 37 = 74\n- Item 2: 2 * 3 = 6\n- Item 3: 2 * 18 = 36\n- Item 4: 3 * 54 = 162\n- Item 5: 3 * 7 = 21\nTotal Value = 74 + 6 + 36 + 162 + 21 = 299\n\nSince 299 is much larger than my outside offer of 83, this split is advantageous for me.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 3, 3]}\n```",

Let's start by offering Player 1 close to half of the items and see how that compares to my outside offer and potential future rounds. Offering them: [2, 1, 1, 3, 3] will give me 600 as we calculated before.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 slightly more than half to test if it makes sense to accept their offer next round if we don't get a very good counteroffer.

That is a value of 600 to me.\nSince it's worse than my outside offer, I can try offering them a bit less. If I offered [1, 0, 0, 2, 2], I would have left [3, 3, 3, 4, 4].\n(3 * 4) + (3 * 29) + (3 * 83) + (4 * 69) + (4 * 91) = 12 + 87 + 249 + 276 + 364 = 988\n\nSo I would counteroffer with [1, 0, 0, 2, 2] to player 1 and keep the rest.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",
