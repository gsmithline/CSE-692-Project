If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 4, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 1 + 31 x 0 + 9 x 4 + 50 x 2 + 39 x 2\n    which is 302 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 303. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Here's one possibility:\n       - Offer Player 1: [2, 0, 1, 1, 0], keeping [2, 2, 3, 3, 2] for myself.\n       - My calculation with this counteroffer:\n         - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 23 = 46\n         - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n         - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n         - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n         - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 23 = 46\n         - Total value = 496\n\n   However, the value 496 from this potential counteroffer is still less than my outside offer.

Your value would be:\n    88 x 1 + 31 x 0 + 9 x 4 + 50 x 2 + 39 x 2\n    which is 302 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 303. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 857. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 600 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 8, 3, 8, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 3 x 8 + 56 x 3 + 83 x 8 + 25 x 0\n    which is 856 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 857. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

I need to ensure that my remaining items are worth more than my outside offer. I want to maximize the chance of getting a deal, so I will start with a fair division where I offer slightly less than half the total value to player 2.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This means I keep 4, 4, 2, 4, 1 units respectively.\nMy value for this would be: (4 * 33) + (4 * 3) + (2 * 56) + (4 * 83) + (1 * 25) = 132 + 12 + 112 + 332 + 25 = 613. This is not better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This means I keep 5, 5, 2, 5, 1 units respectively.\nMy value for this would be: (5 * 33) + (5 * 3) + (2 * 56) + (5 * 83) + (1 * 25) = 165 + 15 + 112 + 415 + 25 = 732. This is still not better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 1 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. This means I keep 6, 6, 3, 6, 1 units respectively.\nMy value for this would be: (6 * 33) + (6 * 3) + (3 * 56) + (6 * 83) + (1 * 25) = 198 + 18 + 168 + 498 + 25 = 907. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince I have found a counteroffer that gives me value better than my outside offer, I will propose it.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

This is significantly less than my outside offer of 857.\n*   **Value of walking away:** My outside offer value is 857.\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to make an offer that gives me more than 857 * 0.9 = 771.3 to justify the risk of waiting another round, or more than 857 to justify accepting immediately.\n\nLet's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to keep the items with high value for myself and offer items of lower value. A good starting point would be to give Player 2 nothing of items 3 and 4. Let's explore this approach.\n\nIf I offered Player 2 [1, 4, 0, 0, 0], I would keep [6, 4, 3, 8, 1]. The value would be: (6*33) + (4*3) + (3*56) + (8*83) + (1*25) = 198 + 12 + 168 + 664 + 25 = 1067\n\nThis is a much more acceptable result and considerably better than the outside offer, especially discounted to the next round.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer (400) is significantly less than my outside offer (857), I should not accept. I also shouldn't walk away since I can make a beneficial offer to the other player.\n\nI will propose the counteroffer [1, 4, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me a value of 1067.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 413. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 666 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 1 + 2 x 1 + 45 x 3 + 37 x 5 + 48 x 0\n    which is 412 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 413. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 1, 4, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 29 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 59 x 0 + 65 x 1\n    which is 65 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 72. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 72\n*   **Values of the items:** item 1: 65, item 2: 29, item 3: 72, item 4: 59, item 5: 65\n*   **Total pool of items:** 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I am player 1, I will start with an offer that gives the other player a fair amount, but still leaves me with more than my outside offer value. I need to offer Player 2 something that would be high enough to keep them engaged, but low enough to benefit myself more.\n\n    I could calculate all the possible distributions, but to save time, I will start with a simple offer, then adjust later.\n\n    **First attempt counteroffer**: Give Player 2 half of each item type, rounded down.\n        *Item 1:* Offer 0 to Player 2. I keep 1. (1 * 65 = 65)\n        *Item 2:* Offer 1 to Player 2. I keep 1. (1 * 29 = 29)\n        *Item 3:* Offer 2 to Player 2. I keep 3. (3 * 72 = 216)\n        *Item 4:* Offer 3 to Player 2. I keep 3. (3 * 59 = 177)\n        *Item 5:* Offer 2 to Player 2. I keep 2. (2 * 65 = 130)\n        *Total value to me:* 65 + 29 + 216 + 177 + 130 = 617\n\n    This is more than my outside offer of 72. Now let's offer a more significant portion of each item to the other player.\n    **Revised Counteroffer:** Give Player 2:\n        * Item 1: 0\n        * Item 2: 1\n        * Item 3: 2\n        * Item 4: 3\n        * Item 5: 2\n    I will keep the remaining items. Let's see if this is better than my outside offer.\n    *Item 1: 1 * 65 = 65\n    *Item 2: 1 * 29 = 29\n    *Item 3: 3 * 72 = 216\n    *Item 4: 3 * 59 = 177\n    *Item 5: 2 * 65 = 130\n    Total = 617. I need to see if an offer slightly more in my favor would still be better.\n\n    **Revised Counteroffer:** Give Player 2:\n        * Item 1: 0\n        * Item 2: 0\n        * Item 3: 2\n        * Item 4: 3\n        * Item 5: 2\n    I will keep the remaining items. Let's see if this is better than my outside offer.\n    *Item 1: 1 * 65 = 65\n    *Item 2: 2 * 29 = 58\n    *Item 3: 3 * 72 = 216\n    *Item 4: 3 * 59 = 177\n    *Item 5: 2 * 65 = 130\n    Total = 646. This seems like a good starting position.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nI will propose the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 3, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 169. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1107 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 275. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 495 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 30 x 2 + 98 x 2 + 18 x 1\n    which is 274 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 275. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assessing Offers:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer, I need to consider potential counteroffers.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nI need to make an initial offer that gives Player 2 some items but leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer. Offering nothing or everything is not optimal. I want to propose an offer where I retain sufficient items to exceed my outside offer value.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I give Player 2 the following: [3, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nThis means I keep:\n*   Item 1: 7 - 3 = 4\n*   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2\n*   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3\n*   Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3\n*   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2\n\nThe value of what I keep is:\n4 * 37 + 2 * 55 + 3 * 72 + 3 * 58 + 2 * 93 = 148 + 110 + 216 + 174 + 186 = 834\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1097.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the optimal action.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 1097\n   - Values of the items: Item 1 = 37, Item 2 = 55, Item 3 = 72, Item 4 = 58, Item 5 = 93\n   - Total items: 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its actual value.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 2 offers me [2, 1, 2, 1, 1].  This means they are offering 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.  Let's calculate the value of this offer:\n\n     Value = (2 * 37) + (1 * 55) + (2 * 72) + (1 * 58) + (1 * 93) = 74 + 55 + 144 + 58 + 93 = 424\n\n   - Since it is round 2, the discounted value of accepting this offer is 424 * 0.9 = 381.6. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 1097.\n\n   - **Consider Player 1's previous Offer:** Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This implies Player 2 gets those items. This means I would get items [6, 3, 4, 5, 3]. Let's calculate the value of this to player 1:\n\n     Value = (6 * 37) + (3 * 55) + (4 * 72) + (5 * 58) + (3 * 93) = 222 + 165 + 288 + 290 + 279 = 1244\n\n   - Since it was round 1, the discounted value of Player 1 accepting this offer is 1244 * 1 = 1244. This is greater than my outside offer of 1097.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's explore some counteroffers.  I need to keep enough items to exceed 1097.  I have 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    To avoid offering nothing or everything, I should aim for a more balanced division of goods.\n       - Item 5 is my highest value item (93), and there are only 3 units. I should try to keep as many as possible.\n       - Item 3 is my second highest value item (72), and there are 5 units.\n       - Item 4 is my third highest value item (58), and there are 6 units.\n       - Item 2 is my fourth highest value item (55), and there are 3 units.\n       - Item 1 is my lowest value item (37), and there are 7 units.\n\n    Let's try keeping the following:\n    [4, 2, 3, 4, 2] (giving [3, 1, 2, 2, 1] to Player 2)\n    Value = (4 * 37) + (2 * 55) + (3 * 72) + (4 * 58) + (2 * 93) = 148 + 110 + 216 + 232 + 186 = 892\n\n   - Too low. It is less than my outside offer of 1097. Let's adjust to keep more of the items with high values.\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] giving [5, 2, 4, 5, 2]\n    Value = (2 * 37) + (1 * 55) + (1 * 72) + (1 * 58) + (1 * 93) = 74 + 55 + 72 + 58 + 93 = 352\n\n   - **Counteroffer:** Let's aim to give a little more than my outside offer when the discount factor is considered.\n    Let's keep the following: [6, 2, 4, 5, 2] (giving [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2)\n    Value = (6 * 37) + (2 * 55) + (4 * 72) + (5 * 58) + (2 * 93) = 222 + 110 + 288 + 290 + 186 = 1096\n\n    Too low, Let's keep more: [6, 3, 4, 5, 3] (giving [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] to player 2, the initial offer that player 1 made)\n    Value = (6 * 37) + (3 * 55) + (4 * 72) + (5 * 58) + (3 * 93) = 222 + 165 + 288 + 290 + 279 = 1244\n    Giving [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] means Player 2 values are 1 * x + 0 * y + 1 * z + 1 * a + 0 * b.\n    Since it is round 2, this is worth 1244 * 0.9 = 1119.6.\n\n3. **Make a decision:**\n\n   - The current offer of [2, 1, 2, 1, 1] has a discounted value of 381.6, which is much worse than my outside offer.\n   - Giving [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] would result in a value of 1119.6.\n   - Since we are on Round 2, offering [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] is greater than outside offer so that will be what I give to player 2\n\nTherefore, I should make the counteroffer to give [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 19. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 0 + 1 x 2 + 16 x 1 + 48 x 0 + 95 x 0\n    which is 18 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 19. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value. This incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer, the value of accepting is not applicable.\n*   I need to consider potential counteroffers. I should aim for offers where my value is greater than 1136.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should propose a counteroffer.\n*   I need to calculate a valid counteroffer where the value I retain is higher than my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's construct a potential counteroffer and calculate its value. I'll start by offering a relatively small amount to Player 2 and see where that puts me. The goal is to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1136.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy value would be:\n(4 * 70) + (1 * 1) + (4 * 74) + (3 * 76) + (2 * 81) = 280 + 1 + 296 + 228 + 162 = 967.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1002. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 669 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 6, 5, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 2 + 81 x 6 + 28 x 5 + 55 x 4 + 37 x 3\n    which is 1001 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1002. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value is 1002.\n    *   My values for the items are: item 1 = 22, item 2 = 81, item 3 = 28, item 4 = 55, item 5 = 37.\n    *   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n    *   The discount factor is 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and in round 3, it's worth 81%. It incentivizes reaching an agreement sooner rather than later, but not at the cost of accepting a bad offer.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   Currently, there is no offer on the table. I need to make the first offer.\n    *   I need to consider potential counteroffers and their value to me compared to my outside offer. I want to make an offer that is likely to be accepted, while also maximizing my value.\n    *   I need to calculate the value of different divisions.\n\n3.  **Decision-making:**\n\n    *   I can't accept because there's no offer.\n    *   I need to decide whether to walk away or propose a counteroffer. Since this is round 1, it's unlikely walking away is the best option.\n\nLet's start by considering an equal-ish split and see what that looks like. I have 4 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. Let's try offering 2, 3, 2, 3, 2 respectively:\nMy Keep: 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 2 of item 5\nValue: (2 * 22) + (3 * 81) + (3 * 28) + (3 * 55) + (2 * 37) = 44 + 243 + 84 + 165 + 74 = 610\nNot great, let's try to offer slightly less, and keep more items for me.\n\nLet's try offering 1, 2, 1, 2, 1 respectively:\nMy Keep: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 3 of item 5\nValue: (3 * 22) + (4 * 81) + (4 * 28) + (4 * 55) + (3 * 37) = 66 + 324 + 112 + 220 + 111 = 833\nBetter, but still less than my outside offer.\nLet's try offering 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 respectively:\nMy Keep: 4 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 4 of item 5\nValue: (4 * 22) + (5 * 81) + (5 * 28) + (5 * 55) + (4 * 37) = 88 + 405 + 140 + 275 + 148 = 1056\n\nThis looks promising and above the outside offer. Let's try to push for a bit more:\n\nLet's try offering 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 respectively:\nMy Keep: 4 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 4 of item 5\nValue: (4 * 22) + (6 * 81) + (5 * 28) + (5 * 55) + (4 * 37) = 88 + 486 + 140 + 275 + 148 = 1137\nThis is a good starting point.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 751. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 639 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 2, 0, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 5 + 68 x 2 + 12 x 0 + 36 x 4 + 5 x 2\n    which is 750 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 751. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [3, 1, 1, 4, 0]  This means Player 2 is offering me 3 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 4 units of Item 4, and 0 units of Item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept: (3 * 92) + (1 * 68) + (1 * 12) + (4 * 36) + (0 * 5) = 276 + 68 + 12 + 144 + 0 = 500\n    *   Discounted value: 500 * 0.9 = 450\n\n*   **Round 1 Offer Analysis:**\n    *   Player 1 offered Player 2: [1, 0, 0, 6, 1]\n    *   This implies Player 1 kept: [5, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n    *   The value of what player 1 kept: 5*92 + 3*68 + 1*12 + 3*36 + 1*5 = 460 + 204 + 12 + 108 + 5 = 789.\n    *   Discounted value: 789 * 0.9 = 710.1\n    *   Since 710.1 < 751, player 1 should not have offered [1, 0, 0, 6, 1]\n\n*   **Round 1 Player 2 Offer Analysis:**\n    *   Player 2 offered Player 1: [3, 1, 1, 4, 0]\n    *   This implies Player 2 kept: [3, 2, 0, 5, 2]\n    *   The value of what player 2 kept: Unknown.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of accepting the current offer (450) is less than my outside offer (751).\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away guarantees me 751.\n*   I need to consider a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, taking the discount factor into account.\n*   If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I keep 6*92+3*68+1*12+9*36+2*5 = 552+204+12+324+10 = 1102. Then 1102 * 0.9 = 991.8 which is better than my outside offer.\n*   I should try to get an offer better than 751/0.9 = 834.44\n\nLet's try to create a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I want to keep as much item 1 as possible, then item 2, then item 4.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 1, 9, 2]. This means I keep [6, 3, 0, 0, 0]. My value would be 6*92 + 3*68 = 552 + 204 = 756. Discounted value: 756 * 0.9 = 680.4. This is less than 751.\nLet's try offering [0, 1, 1, 9, 2]. This means I keep [6, 2, 0, 0, 0]. My value would be 6*92 + 2*68 = 552 + 136 = 688. Discounted value: 688 * 0.9 = 619.2. This is less than 751.\nLet's try offering [1, 1, 1, 9, 2]. This means I keep [5, 2, 0, 0, 0]. My value would be 5*92 + 2*68 = 460 + 136 = 596. Discounted value: 596 * 0.9 = 536.4. This is less than 751.\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 1, 8, 2]. This means I keep [6, 3, 0, 1, 0]. My value would be 6*92 + 3*68 + 1*36= 552 + 204 + 36 = 792. Discounted value: 792 * 0.9 = 712.8. This is less than 751.\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 1, 7, 2]. This means I keep [6, 3, 0, 2, 0]. My value would be 6*92 + 3*68 + 2*36= 552 + 204 + 72 = 828. Discounted value: 828 * 0.9 = 745.2. This is less than 751.\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 1, 6, 2]. This means I keep [6, 3, 0, 3, 0]. My value would be 6*92 + 3*68 + 3*36= 552 + 204 + 108 = 864.

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 44 for item 1, 43 for item 2, 61 for item 3, 31 for item 4, 85 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 903. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 177. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 177. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 4 + 43 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 31 x 0 + 85 x 0\n    which is 176 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 177. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 6, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 1, 4, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 6, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 6, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide my action, let's analyze the current situation using the provided step-by-step questions:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 177.\n   - The values of the items for me are:\n     - Item 1: 44 per unit\n     - Item 2: 43 per unit\n     - Item 3: 61 per unit\n     - Item 4: 31 per unit\n     - Item 5: 85 per unit\n   - The total pool of items consists of 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 9 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor influences the negotiation as it reduces the value of future offers, making it critical to compare current offers adjusted by the discount factor.\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer:\n   - Current offer (given to me): [0, 0, 1, 6, 2]\n     - Item 1: 0 units -> 0 value\n     - Item 2: 0 units -> 0 value\n     - Item 3: 1 unit -> 1 x 61 = 61 value\n     - Item 4: 6 units -> 6 x 31 = 186 value\n     - Item 5: 2 units -> 2 x 85 = 170 value\n     - Total value = 61 + 186 + 170 = 417\n\n3) Compare with outside offer:\n   - The current offer's value of 417 is much higher than my outside offer value of 177. Even considering the discount factor (which is more relevant in later rounds), accepting this deal is better than walking away.\n\nGiven that the value of the current offer is significantly higher than my outside offer, it is beneficial to accept the current offer to maximize my payoff and avoid any further discount on my value.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1022.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 40, item 2 = 66, item 3 = 62, item 4 = 44, item 5 = 88.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - I need to formulate a counteroffer that maximizes my potential value while considering the possibility of Player 2 rejecting it and the impact of the discount factor.\n   - The total value of all items to me is (4 * 40) + (5 * 66) + (6 * 62) + (2 * 44) + (5 * 88) = 160 + 330 + 372 + 88 + 440 = 1390.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince this is the first round, I want to make a reasonable offer that gives Player 2 enough to consider accepting, but still leaves me with a good value. I also need to ensure that my offer is better than walking away.\n\nLet's start by considering an equal split and then adjust the offer in Player 2's favor to increase the likelihood of acceptance.\nGiving half the items to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 2 units, item 2: 2 units, item 3: 3 units, item 4: 1 unit, item 5: 2 units\n\nMy value if Player 2 accepts this offer:\n- I keep Item 1: 2 units * 40 = 80\n- I keep Item 2: 3 units * 66 = 198\n- I keep Item 3: 3 units * 62 = 186\n- I keep Item 4: 1 unit * 44 = 44\n- I keep Item 5: 3 units * 88 = 264\n- Total value = 80 + 198 + 186 + 44 + 264 = 772\n\nThis value (772) is much lower than my outside offer value (1022). Therefore I should offer more to Player 2. Let's formulate an offer that gives me a value of around 1100, and Player 2 gets 290.\n\nI will offer the following to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 0 unit, item 2: 0 unit, item 3: 1 unit, item 4: 0 unit, item 5: 0 unit\n\nMy value if Player 2 accepts this offer:\n- I keep Item 1: 4 units * 40 = 160\n- I keep Item 2: 5 units * 66 = 330\n- I keep Item 3: 5 units * 62 = 310\n- I keep Item 4: 2 unit * 44 = 88\n- I keep Item 5: 5 units * 88 = 440\n- Total value = 160 + 330 + 310 + 88 + 440 = 1328\n\nThis offer means I get 1328, and Player 2 gets:\n- Item 3: 1 unit * unknown value\nSince I want to maximize my value, and I need to give more to player 2, then let's consider offering player 2 1 item 1, 1 item 2, 1 item 3, 1 item 4, and 1 item 5.\n\nI will offer the following to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1 unit, item 2: 1 unit, item 3: 1 unit, item 4: 1 unit, item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy value if Player 2 accepts this offer:\n- I keep Item 1: 3 units * 40 = 120\n- I keep Item 2: 4 units * 66 = 264\n- I keep Item 3: 5 units * 62 = 310\n- I keep Item 4: 1 unit * 44 = 44\n- I keep Item 5: 4 units * 88 = 352\n- Total value = 120 + 264 + 310 + 44 + 352 = 1090\n\nThis offer means I get 1090, which is greater than my outside option 1022, and Player 2 gets:\n- Item 1: 1 unit * unknown value\n- Item 2: 1 unit * unknown value\n- Item 3: 1 unit * unknown value\n- Item 4: 1 unit * unknown value\n- Item 5: 1 unit * unknown value\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1361. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1152 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 5, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 3 + 64 x 4 + 96 x 5 + 48 x 2 + 87 x 3\n    which is 1360 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1361. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [3, 1, 0, 0, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 units, 40 value/unit = 120\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit, 66 value/unit = 66\n    *   Item 3: 0 unit, 62 value/unit = 0\n    *   Item 4: 0 unit, 44 value/unit = 0\n    *   Item 5: 2 unit, 88 value/unit = 176\n    *   Total value = 120 + 66 + 0 + 0 + 176 = 362\n    *   Discounted value = 362 * 0.9 = 325.8\n    *   This value (325.8) is much lower than my outside offer value of 1022.\n\n*   **Consider keeping everything:** If I keep all items, my value is:\n    *   Item 1: 4 * 40 = 160\n    *   Item 2: 5 * 66 = 330\n    *   Item 3: 6 * 62 = 372\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 44 = 88\n    *   Item 5: 5 * 88 = 440\n    *   Total value = 160 + 330 + 372 + 88 + 440 = 1390\n\n*   **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1022.

This is less than the outside offer, so we need to offer less to Player 2.\n    Let's increase items 3 and 5:\n    * Item 1: 2, value = 80\n    * Item 2: 3, value = 198\n    * Item 3: 5, value = 310\n    * Item 4: 1, value = 44\n    * Item 5: 5, value = 440\n    * Total = 1072\n\n    Now, let's find what this counteroffer entails. I keep 2 of item 1, so I offer 2 to player 2. I keep 3 of item 2, so I offer 2 to player 2. I keep 5 of item 3, so I offer 1 to player 2. I keep 1 of item 4, so I offer 1 to player 2. I keep 5 of item 5, so I offer 0 to player 2.\n    So the counteroffer is: [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1361. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1152 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 5, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 3 + 64 x 4 + 96 x 5 + 48 x 2 + 87 x 3\n    which is 1360 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1361. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This is round 3, so the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 2, 2, 0, 3]. This means Player 2 gets:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 2 = 4\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2\n\n    My value from accepting the current offer:\n    *   (2 \\* 40) + (2 \\* 66) + (2 \\* 62) + (0 \\* 44) + (3 \\* 88) = 80 + 132 + 124 + 0 + 264 = 600\n    Considering the discount factor, my value is 600 * 0.81 = 486\n*   This value (486) is much worse than my outside offer (1022).

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 5, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 3 + 64 x 4 + 96 x 5 + 48 x 2 + 87 x 3\n    which is 1360 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1361. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 0, 3]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1361.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 89\n     - Item 2: 64\n     - Item 3: 96\n     - Item 4: 48\n     - Item 5: 87\n   - Total pool of items: [4, 5, 6, 2, 5]\n   - The discount factor influences the decision by reducing the value of any negotiated deal by a factor of \\(\\gamma^{(r-1)}\\), where \\(r\\) is the round number. Since it's round 3, both players will experience a greater effect from the discount factor.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Total value of accepting the current offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\n     - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n     - Total value of current offer = 64\n   - The current offer provides far less value than my outside offer of 1361.\n   - Any potential counteroffer must have a total value to me greater than 1361, which accounts for my values for the items I keep.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer provides significantly less value than my outside offer.\n   - Given that it's the final round, any counteroffer I make will be interpreted as walking away if it does not exceed my outside offer value of 1361.\n   - The history shows that reaching a mutually beneficial agreement is unlikely at this stage. Player 1's latest offer is significantly less favorable, indicating a potential inflexibility or drastically different valuation.\n\nConsidering all the factors and avoiding the possible mistakes laid out, the best action is to walk away since accepting the offer would result in a value much less than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

My goal is to make a counteroffer where my value is greater than 824, which is preferable to my outside offer.\n\nLet's create a more advantageous counteroffer:\n- To maximize my value, consider keeping more of item 2 (high value) and balancing with other items.\n\nTo offer Player 1 a counteroffer, calculate potential divisions:\n- I'll aim to keep 5 units of item 2 (96), 3 units of item 4 (36), and 4 units of item 5 (31), then calculate if the total value exceeds 824.\n- Giving Player 1: [2, 3, 4, 4, 1] \n- My units: [0, 5, 0, 3, 4]\n\n   - My total value:\n     - Item 1: 0 x 37 = 0\n     - Item 2: 5 x 96 = 480\n     - Item 3: 0 x 33 = 0\n     - Item 4: 3 x 36 = 108\n     - Item 5: 4 x 31 = 124\n     - Total value = 712\n\n712 is still less than 824\n\nWe have to revise it to make sure I exceed the outside offer:\n\n- Rebalance more items so:\n   - Giving Player 1: [1, 3, 4, 4, 2]\n   - My units: [1, 5, 0, 3, 3]\n\n   - My total value:\n     - Item 1: 1 x 37 = 37\n     - Item 2: 5 x 96 = 480\n     - Item 3: 0 x 33 = 0\n     - Item 4: 3 x 36 = 108\n     - Item 5: 3 x 31 = 93\n     - Total value = 718\n\n718 is still less than 824; let's make another adjustment:\n\n- I will change the allocation to:\n     - Giving Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n     - My units: [1, 7, 3, 5, 4]\n \n  - My total value:\n     - Item 1: 1 x 37 = 37\n     - Item 2: 7 x 96 = 672\n     - Item 3: 3 x 33 = 99\n     - Item 4: 5 x 36 = 180\n     - Item 5: 4 x 31 = 124\n     - Total value = 1112\n\n1112 exceeds 824\n\nThus, my action is to propose a counteroffer that exceeds the value of my outside offer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 943. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 943. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 8, 3, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 1 + 85 x 8 + 34 x 3 + 17 x 7 + 87 x 0\n    which is 942 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 943. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in round 3 is worth 90% of what it would be worth in round 2.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** The current offer on the table is [1, 1, 1, 2, 1].

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 943. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 8, 3, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 1 + 85 x 8 + 34 x 3 + 17 x 7 + 87 x 0\n    which is 942 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 943. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Given it is round 1, it's worth proposing an offer that favors me.\n\n3) **Decision-making:**\n\nSince there's no current offer, I need to make an initial offer. I want to start with an offer that is somewhat favorable to me but not so aggressive that Player 2 will immediately walk away. I need to offer enough value to the other player that they see potential in negotiating. Let's try giving Player 2 a moderate amount of some of the items.\n\nHere's my thought process for a potential offer. I want to keep most of the high-value items (1 and 2) and give the player some of the lower value items (3, 4, and 5). I'll give the other player 1 unit of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, and the majority of the units of the items 3,4,5.

The current offer is not acceptable as it is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n   - I must consider potential counteroffers that achieve a value greater than 694.\n\n3) Make a Decision:\n   - Should I accept the current offer? No, as its value (418) is less than my outside offer (694).\n   - Should I walk away? Not yet. I can try a counteroffer that aligns with my interests.\n\nTo create a beneficial counteroffer, I need to retain a portion of items with a combined value of more than 694. Let's evaluate retaining higher-value item units and offering fewer of these to Player 1.\n\nLet's try keeping [3, 4, 0, 0, 1] for myself and offer [2, 1, 2, 3, 2] to Player 1:\n- My retained units value:\n  - 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (Item 1)\n  - 4 \u00d7 20 = 80  (Item 2)\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n  - 1 \u00d7 43 = 43  (Item 5)\n- Total value = 180 + 80 + 0 + 0 + 43 = 303, which is not better than the current offer, nor my outside offer.\n\nI have to revise the counteroffer. Let's offer them [3, 3, 1, 1, 1]:\n- My retained units value:\n  - 2 \u00d7 60 = 120 (Item 1)\n  - 2 \u00d7 20 = 40  (Item 2)\n  - 1 \u00d7 89 = 89  (Item 3)\n  - 2 \u00d7 37 = 74  (Item 4)\n  - 2 \u00d7 43 = 86  (Item 5)\n- Total value = 120 + 40 + 89 + 74 + 86 = 409 \n- This strategy isn't helpful either; I need to reassess my approach to beat 694.\n\nNow let's go for an aggressive strategy: retain all costly items:\n\nTry retaining [5, 4, 0, 0, 0]:\n- My retained units value:\n  - 5 \u00d7 60 = 300 (Item 1)\n  - 4 \u00d7 20 = 80  (Item 2)\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n- Total value = 300 + 80 = 380, still insufficient.\n\nFinal Attempt: Claim items based on highest unit value:\nLet's offer [5, 4, 0, 2, 3] and retain [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]:\n- My retained units value:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \n  - 1 \u00d7 20 = 20 (Item 2)\n  - 2 \u00d7 89 = 178 (Item 3)\n  - 1 \u00d7 37 = 37  (Item 4)\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n- Total value = 0 + 20 + 178 + 37 = 235, insufficient.\n\nNone of these are useful. I'll modify my approach to focus on using a more weighted value for items similarly highly valued and propose a worthy counteroffer.\n\n[\"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\":[0, 5, 0, 1, 0]]",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 831. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 831. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 5, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 2 + 34 x 3 + 49 x 5 + 97 x 3 + 29 x 6\n    which is 830 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 831. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best action in this first round.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n    - My outside offer value: 831\n    - My item values: item 1 = 9, item 2 = 34, item 3 = 49, item 4 = 97, item 5 = 29\n    - Total item pool: item 1 = 6, item 2 = 3, item 3 = 5, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 6\n    - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means waiting reduces the value of any deal.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - Current offer: None. I need to make an offer.\n    - Potential counteroffers: I need to explore different divisions of items.\n    - Comparison to outside offer: Any accepted offer must be worth at least 831 * gamma^(r-1).\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\n    - Since there is no offer to accept, I must make a counteroffer or walk away.\n    - Making a good initial offer is important. I want to propose something that is (a) attractive enough for Player 2 to consider and (b) leaves me with a value exceeding my outside offer, even considering the discount factor if negotiations extend to future rounds.\n\nLet's try to come up with a reasonable offer. The other player has no information about my outside offer. Let's aim for a 50/50 split of the total value, with me getting slightly more since it's round 1. This requires some estimation of their values. Since their values are random between 1-101, I can assume their *average* value per item is roughly 50. Therefore, the total item pool value for Player 2 would be approximately:\n\n6 * 50 + 3 * 50 + 5 * 50 + 3 * 50 + 6 * 50 = 23 * 50 = 1150. A \"fair\" split would be 575 each. Since I know my total value is 866, it means Player 2's total value is much larger than mine, given the range.\n\nI'll start by offering Player 2 slightly less than half of the items and see how they respond.\nLet's try offering them: [3, 1, 2, 1, 3]. This means I keep [3, 2, 3, 2, 3].\nValue to me: 3 * 9 + 2 * 34 + 3 * 49 + 2 * 97 + 3 * 29 = 27 + 68 + 147 + 194 + 87 = 523. This is significantly below my outside option of 831.\n\nLet me try an offer of [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. That means that I will keep [5, 3, 5, 3, 5].\nValue to me: 5 * 9 + 3 * 34 + 5 * 49 + 3 * 97 + 5 * 29 = 45 + 102 + 245 + 291 + 145 = 828. Still less than my outside offer, and I need to consider the discount rate.\n\nLet's consider offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That means I keep everything [6, 3, 5, 3, 6].\nValue to me: 6 * 9 + 3 * 34 + 5 * 49 + 3 * 97 + 6 * 29 = 54 + 102 + 245 + 291 + 174 = 866. This is better than my outside offer, which is already good for me. So I should offer the least that is acceptable to get this accepted as soon as possible. The discount rate of 0.9 each round is significant.\n\nLet's make the offer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], meaning that I keep [6, 3, 5, 3, 5]\nValue to me: 6 * 9 + 3 * 34 + 5 * 49 + 3 * 97 + 5 * 29 = 54 + 102 + 245 + 291 + 145 = 837. This is slightly better than my outside option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    22 x 6 + 49 x 3 + 97 x 4 + 82 x 3 + 21 x 6\n    which is 1039 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1043. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 106. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 474 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 23 x 1 + 13 x 2 + 28 x 2 + 85 x 0\n    which is 105 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 106. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 2, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 106\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 9, Item 2: 23, Item 3: 13, Item 4: 28, Item 5: 85\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 8, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 8\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means offers in later rounds are worth less. Accepting now is better than getting the same value next round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit (2 - 1 = 1)\n    *   Item 2: 7 units (8 - 1 = 7)\n    *   Item 3: 3 units (4 - 1 = 3)\n    *   Item 4: 2 units (4 - 2 = 2)\n    *   Item 5: 8 units (8 - 0 = 8)\n    *   Total value: (1 * 9) + (7 * 23) + (3 * 13) + (2 * 28) + (8 * 85) = 9 + 161 + 39 + 56 + 680 = 945\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer is worth 945, which is significantly greater than my outside offer of 106.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n   - I will try a counteroffer where I receive a value higher than my outside offer value of 106. I should also keep in mind that I want to improve from the current offer to me ([1, 1, 1, 2, 0]).\n\n**Potential Counteroffer Calculations (Examples):**\n\nBefore settling on accepting an offer, I must consider if there is a better counteroffer available. I will evaluate a few potential offers before making a choice.\n\nLet's assume that I give the other player [1, 5, 2, 2, 4].\n*   Item 1: 1 unit (2-1=1)\n*   Item 2: 3 unit (8-5=3)\n*   Item 3: 2 unit (4-2=2)\n*   Item 4: 2 unit (4-2=2)\n*   Item 5: 4 unit (8-4=4)\n*   Total Value: (1 * 9) + (3 * 23) + (2 * 13) + (2 * 28) + (4 * 85) = 9 + 69 + 26 + 56 + 340 = 500\n\nLet's assume that I give the other player [0, 7, 3, 3, 7].\n*   Item 1: 2 units (2-0=2)\n*   Item 2: 1 unit (8-7=1)\n*   Item 3: 1 unit (4-3=1)\n*   Item 4: 1 unit (4-3=1)\n*   Item 5: 1 unit (8-7=1)\n*   Total Value: (2 * 9) + (1 * 23) + (1 * 13) + (1 * 28) + (1 * 85) = 18 + 23 + 13 + 28 + 85 = 167\n\nLet's assume that I give the other player [1, 6, 3, 3, 6].\n*   Item 1: 1 units (2-1=1)\n*   Item 2: 2 unit (8-6=2)\n*   Item 3: 1 unit (4-3=1)\n*   Item 4: 1 unit (4-3=1)\n*   Item 5: 2 unit (8-6=2)\n*   Total Value: (1 * 9) + (2 * 23) + (1 * 13) + (1 * 28) + (2 * 85) = 9 + 46 + 13 + 28 + 170 = 266\n\nBased on this analysis, the current offer is exceptionally good. Trying to squeeze out a slightly better counteroffer risks a failed negotiation.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven that the current offer of 945 greatly exceeds my outside offer of 106, and after evaluating some potential counteroffers, I should accept the current offer as it would be Mistake 5 to WALK away or propose a worse offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means the value of offers will decrease if not accepted in current/future rounds due to the applied discount.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer to me is [1, 1, 1, 3, 0]:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 47 = 0\n     - Total value if I accept: 39 + 68 + 65 + 210 + 0 = 382\n\n   - Value comparison:\n     - Current offer value (382) is significantly less than my outside offer value (671).\n   \n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting this current offer would grant me a value of 382, which is much less than my outside offer of 671. Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away ensures I receive my outside offer value of 671.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer where the value to me exceeds 671 is required to avoid Mistake 2.\n\nLet's calculate a potential counteroffer maximizing my value while offering Player 1 a fair share or getting an indication of what they value less:\n\nTo achieve a value higher than 671 for myself, consider keeping more high-value items:\n\n- Keep most of item 4 (highest value to me) and sufficient items reaching more than 671:\n  - Tentative offer: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2] (giving Player 1 the rest) keeps:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n    - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 47 = 0\n  - Total value = 78 + 204 + 130 + 350 + 0 = 762\n\nThis proposed division ensures I receive a value higher than my outside offer while also giving Player 1 some units reflecting their potential preferences indicated by their offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 0 + 73 x 0 + 34 x 0 + 37 x 5 + 99 x 0\n    which is 185 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 188. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 5, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 0 + 40 x 4 + 29 x 5 + 98 x 4 + 30 x 1\n    which is 727 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 728. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To evaluate the current offer and decide on my action, let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation**:\n   - **My outside offer value**: 728\n   - **Values of the items**:\n     - Item 1: 69\n     - Item 2: 40\n     - Item 3: 29\n     - Item 4: 98\n     - Item 5: 30\n   - **Total pool of items**:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 6 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor influence**: The value of accepting now is more beneficial compared to waiting due to the discount factor reducing the value for future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers**:\n   - **Current offer from Player 1**: [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n     - Value if I accept:\n       - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 69 = 0\n       - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 98 = 98\n       - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n       - Total value = 40 + 58 + 98 = 196\n     - This value (196) is significantly lower than my outside offer of 728.\n   - **Potential counteroffers**:\n     - To consider a valid counteroffer, the total value must exceed 728.\n\n3) **Decision Based on Analysis**:\n   - **Current offer**: Accepting the offer would give me a value of 196, which is far below my outside offer (728), violating Mistake 4.\n   - **Counteroffer consideration**: I need to propose something that ensures my share is valued above 728.\n\n   To construct a counteroffer, let's begin by estimating a distribution that values higher items more significantly:\n   \n   - Suppose I propose to keep [2, 4, 3, 3, 1] for myself. Let's calculate:\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n     - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 40 = 160\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n     - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n     - Total value = 138 + 160 + 87 + 294 + 30 = 709\n\n   This is also below 728, but it's a step closer. Let's adjust further to minimize units given to Player 1:\n   \n   - If I keep all of item 4 and maximize its contribution: [2, 4, 3, 4, 0]\n     - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n     - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 40 = 160\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n     - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n     - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n     - Total value = 138 + 160 + 87 + 392 = 777\n\n   This value exceeds my outside offer of 728. Thus, a potential counteroffer would be to allocate: [1, 2, 3, 0, 2] to Player 1, keeping [2, 4, 3, 4, 0] for myself.\n\nTherefore, based on the current situation and after adjustments, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]}\n```",

Let's aim for a total value of at least 728 or above after factoring the discount. Ideally, to account for the discount, (Target value = 728 * \\( \\gamma^{(2-1)} \\) = 728 * 0.9 = 655.2)\n   \n   If I keep:\n   - Item 1: 1 unit = 1 \\* 69 = 69\n   - Item 2: 5 units = 5 \\* 40 = 200\n   - Item 3: 6 units = 6 \\* 29 = 174\n   - Item 4: 4 units = 4 \\* 98 = 392\n   - Item 5: 2 units = 2 \\* 30 = 60\n   - Total value = 69 + 200 + 174 + 392 + 60 = 895\n\n   Let's propose this division given I negotiate by offering the minimum items possible:\n     - Counteroffer: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0] giving minimal to Player 1, but keep my overall value high.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   Since the current offer is below the outside offer, and ensuring my counteroffer is valuable enough to exceed my outside offer after accounting for discount:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 57 for item 1, 19 for item 2, 94 for item 3, 18 for item 4, 3 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 927. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 516. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 516. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 573 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 4, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 1 + 19 x 4 + 94 x 4 + 18 x 0 + 3 x 2\n    which is 515 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 516. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 516\n   - Item values: item 1 = 57, item 2 = 19, item 3 = 94, item 4 = 18, item 5 = 3\n   - Total items: 3 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n      - Value of current offer: (2 * 57) + (1 * 19) + (0 * 94) + (0 * 18) + (0 * 3) = 114 + 19 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 133\n      - Discounted value of current offer: 133 * 0.81 = 107.73\n   - Since 107.73 < 516, accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n   - Consider walking away: This yields a value of 516.\n\n   - Let's evaluate a potential counteroffer. I have 3 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], I keep all the items.\n      - Value if I keep all items: (3 * 57) + (6 * 19) + (6 * 94) + (4 * 18) + (2 * 3) = 171 + 114 + 564 + 72 + 6 = 927\n      - Discounted value: 927 * 0.81 = 750.87\n   - Let's evaluate another counteroffer.

So I need to decide if I can get any thing better than my outside offer.\n   \n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 107.73, which is less than my outside offer of 516.\n   - Walking away yields a value of 516.\n   - Making a counteroffer will be treated as a walk, yielding a value of 516.\n\n   Therefore, the optimal action is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
