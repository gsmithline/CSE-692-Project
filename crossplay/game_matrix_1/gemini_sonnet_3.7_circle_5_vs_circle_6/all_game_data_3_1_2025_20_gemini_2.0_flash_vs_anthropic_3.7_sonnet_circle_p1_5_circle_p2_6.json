Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 285. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 285. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 95 x 0 + 71 x 0 + 12 x 1 + 68 x 4\n    which is 284 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 285. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

We should start by thinking about which items are most valuable to us (Item 2) and least valuable (Item 4).\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\n\nSince there is no offer, we must make an initial offer. We want to give Player 2 enough to incentivize them to accept, but keep enough for ourselves to exceed our outside offer. It's Round 1, so we can afford to be somewhat aggressive. Let's start by giving half of each item to Player 2.\n\n**Proposed Offer:** [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\n**My remaining items:** [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\n**Value of remaining items:**\n\n*   Item 1: 2 * 66 = 132\n*   Item 2: 2 * 95 = 190\n*   Item 3: 2 * 71 = 142\n*   Item 4: 2 * 12 = 24\n*   Item 5: 2 * 68 = 136\n*   **Total Value = 132 + 190 + 142 + 24 + 136 = 624**\n\nThis offer yields a value of 624, which is significantly higher than our outside offer of 285.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 285\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 66, Item 2: 95, Item 3: 71, Item 4: 12, Item 5: 68\n*   **Total Item Pool:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer Value:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 1, 0, 2, 3]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 1 units\n    *   Item 3: 0 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n\n    Value of current offer = (2 \\* 66) + (1 \\* 95) + (0 \\* 71) + (2 \\* 12) + (3 \\* 68) = 132 + 95 + 0 + 24 + 204 = 455\n    Adjusted value (discounted by 0.9) = 455 * 0.9 = 409.5\n\n*   **Counteroffer Considerations:**  I need to consider what I would receive from various potential counteroffers and if it exceeds 285 to avoid Mistake 2 (Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.)\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer yields a value of 409.5, which is better than my outside offer of 285.\n*   Walking away would only give me 285.\n*   Let's consider a potential counteroffer. I want to give player 2 values that allow me to get a higher payoff than the current offer.\n\nLet's evaluate a counteroffer where I offer Player 2 [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]. This leaves me with:\n* Item 1: 2 units\n* Item 2: 2 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 2 units\nMy value would be (2 * 66) + (2 * 95) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 12) + (2 * 68) = 132 + 190 + 142 + 24 + 136 = 624\nDiscounted value = 624 * 0.9 = 561.6. That offer is too generous, let's try another one.\n\nLets evaluate a counteroffer where I offer player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This leaves me with everything.\nMy value would be (3 * 66) + (4 * 95) + (3 * 71) + (3 * 12) + (4 * 68) = 198 + 380 + 213 + 36 + 272 = 1099\nDiscounted value = 1099 * 0.9 = 989.1. This is higher but it may be rejected.\n\nLets try a compromise offer where I offer player 2 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This leaves me with:\n* Item 1: 2 units\n* Item 2: 3 units\n* Item 3: 2 units\n* Item 4: 2 units\n* Item 5: 3 units\nMy value would be (2 * 66) + (3 * 95) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 12) + (3 * 68) = 132 + 285 + 142 + 24 + 204 = 787\nDiscounted value = 787 * 0.9 = 708.3.\n\nSince 409.5 > 285, I am getting more than my walk away, and the negotiation is going to end this round.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 213. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 849 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 1 + 75 x 0 + 40 x 1 + 95 x 1 + 4 x 2\n    which is 212 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 213. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me in present value terms.

Since some items have odd numbers of units available, let's round down to the nearest even number for those items and split that evenly.\n\n*   Item 1: I keep 5, offer 5.\n*   Item 2: I keep 3, offer 3.\n*   Item 3: I keep 0, offer 1.\n*   Item 4: I keep 2, offer 3.\n*   Item 5: I keep 3, offer 4.\n\nMy value for this offer would be:\n\n*   5 * 69 + 3 * 75 + 0 * 40 + 2 * 95 + 3 * 4 = 345 + 225 + 0 + 190 + 12 = 772\n\nThis is significantly greater than my outside offer of 213.\n\nHowever, let's try to optimize it further. I will create an offer to give away more items to Player 2 while maintaining a value greater than 213.\n*   Item 1: I keep 3, offer 7. (3 * 69 = 207)\n*   Item 2: I keep 1, offer 5.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means I keep:\n     - Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2\n     - Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4\n     - Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2\n     - Item 4: 6 - 2 = 4\n     - Item 5: 6 - 4 = 2\n   - Value of current offer: (2 * 73) + (4 * 64) + (2 * 15) + (4 * 13) + (2 * 34) = 146 + 256 + 30 + 52 + 68 = 552\n   - Discounted value of current offer: 552 * 0.9 = 496.8. This is slightly less than my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider some potential counteroffers. I want to find an offer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer. I'll aim for a total value exceeding 497/0.9 = 552.22.\n\nLet's evaluate a possible counteroffer: [0, 3, 2, 3, 3]. This is the previous offer from me in round 1.\n   - I keep:\n     - Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2\n     - Item 2: 6 - 3 = 3\n     - Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3\n     - Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3\n     - Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3\n   - Value of this counteroffer: (2 * 73) + (3 * 64) + (3 * 15) + (3 * 13) + (3 * 34) = 146 + 192 + 45 + 39 + 102 = 524\n   - Discounted Value: 524 * 0.9 = 471.6. This is lower than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider another counteroffer that's better than my previous counteroffer, and also better than my outside offer. I will make a counteroffer where I offer the following: [0, 1, 2, 2, 2].\n   - I keep:\n     - Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2\n     - Item 2: 6 - 1 = 5\n     - Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3\n     - Item 4: 6 - 2 = 4\n     - Item 5: 6 - 2 = 4\n   - Value of this counteroffer: (2 * 73) + (5 * 64) + (3 * 15) + (4 * 13) + (4 * 34) = 146 + 320 + 45 + 52 + 136 = 699\n   - Discounted Value: 699 * 0.9 = 629.1. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer, after discounting, is worse than my outside offer.\n   - I can propose the counteroffer [0, 1, 2, 2, 2], which, even after discounting, provides a value better than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]}\n",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 375. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 375. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 0 + 70 x 2 + 26 x 1 + 49 x 2 + 22 x 5\n    which is 374 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 375. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 2, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 3, 2, 4]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

I need to aim for a deal that exceeds my outside offer, taking the discount factor into account in future rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to formulate an initial offer. My goal is to maximize my value while also making it attractive enough for Player 2 to accept. I need to keep items that are of high value to me and give away items of lower value.\n\nLet's try to find a good counteroffer. First, a baseline: if I were to keep half of everything, my value would be approximately:\n1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 60 = 60\n4.5 units of item 2 = 4.5 * 27 = 121.5\n3 units of item 3 = 3 * 71 = 213\n4 units of item 4 = 4 * 8 = 32\n2 units of item 5 = 2 * 24 = 48\nTotal value = 60 + 121.5 + 213 + 32 + 48 = 474.5\n\nThis is far below my outside offer. Now let's try an offer that is close to my outside offer. I will try to keep all item 3 and item 1, some of item 2 and item 5, and none of item 4.\nLet's say I keep 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 2 of item 5.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1715. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1062 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 6, 5, 8, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 2 + 89 x 6 + 92 x 5 + 46 x 8 + 49 x 4\n    which is 1714 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1715. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 0, 8, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 0, 8, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision. Let's go through this step by step.\n\n1) Current situation analysis:\n   - My outside offer value is 1715\n   - My item values: Item 1 = 78, Item 2 = 89, Item 3 = 92, Item 4 = 46, Item 5 = 49\n   - Total pool: 2 units of item 1, 9 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor is 0.9, but since we're in round 1, no discount applies yet\n\n2) Value assessment:\n\nFirst, let me assess the current offer from Player 1:\nIf I accept [0, 4, 0, 8, 2], I would get:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 78 = 0\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 92 = 0\n- 8 units of item 4: 8 \u00d7 46 = 368\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\nTotal value = 822\n\nThis is significantly below my outside offer of 1715, so I should not accept.\n\nLet me formulate a strategic counteroffer. Based on their offer, it seems Player 1 values items 1 and 3 highly (offering me none), and values items 2, 4, and 5 less. This gives me some insight for my counteroffer.\n\nI'll try to keep most of the high-value items for me (items 1, 2, and 3) while offering Player 1 more of the lower-value items (4 and 5).\n\nLet me propose keeping:\n- 2 units of item 1 (all): 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n- 7 units of item 2: 7 \u00d7 89 = 623\n- 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 92 = 460\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\nTotal value = 1,475\n\nThis is below my outside offer of 1715. Let me adjust.\n\nLet me try keeping:\n- 2 units of item 1 (all): 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n- 8 units of item 2: 8 \u00d7 89 = 712\n- 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 92 = 460\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\nTotal value = 1,564\n\nStill below my outside offer. Let me adjust again.\n\nLet me try keeping:\n- 2 units of item 1 (all): 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n- 8 units of item 2: 8 \u00d7 89 = 712\n- 6 units of item 3 (all): 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 46 = 138\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\nTotal value = 1,656\n\nStill below my outside offer. One more adjustment:\n\nLet me try keeping:\n- 2 units of item 1 (all): 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n- 8 units of item 2: 8 \u00d7 89 = 712\n- 6 units of item 3 (all): 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\nTotal value = 1,702\n\nLet's try one more time:\n\nLet me try keeping:\n- 2 units of item 1 (all): 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n- 8 units of item 2: 8 \u00d7 89 = 712\n- 6 units of item 3 (all): 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 46 = 230\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\nTotal value = 1,748\n\nThis is above my outside offer of 1715, so it's acceptable.\n\n3) Decision:\nMy counteroffer to Player 1 will be [0, 1, 0, 3, 2], meaning I keep [2, 8, 6, 5, 2].\nThis gives me a value of 1,748, which exceeds my outside offer of 1,715.\n\nBased on my analysis, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 3, 2]}",

Your value would be:\n    78 x 2 + 89 x 6 + 92 x 5 + 46 x 8 + 49 x 4\n    which is 1714 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1715. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The discounted value of 1738.8 exceeds my outside offer of 1715.\n\nBased on the negotiation history, Player 1 has been asking for progressively less, which suggests they might value item 4 and item 5 more than I do. Their first offer wanted 8 units of item 4, then reduced to 2 units.\n\nThis is a very good offer for me, and there's a risk that if I make a counteroffer, Player 1 might walk away in the next round or the deal value will be further discounted.\n\nTherefore, I will accept this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 510. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 5 + 33 x 3 + 71 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 65 x 0\n    which is 509 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 510.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\nSince there is no current offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. I want to maximize my value, considering the other player will likely want a fair share. I need to construct an offer that is better than my outside offer of 510, assuming the other player is rational.\n\nLet's consider a few possible counteroffers and their values to me. Remember, mistake 3 is offering all or none.\n\nI want to come up with an offer that gives some of the items to Player 2 while keeping some for myself, and ensuring the value of what I keep is greater than my outside offer of 510.\n\n*Offer 1: Give 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy value: (3 * 82) + (3 * 33) + (1 * 71) + (3 * 5) + (1 * 65) = 246 + 99 + 71 + 15 + 65 = 496.  This is less than my outside offer of 510, so Mistake 2.\n\n*Offer 2: Give 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy value: (4 * 82) + (3 * 33) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 5) + (1 * 65) = 328 + 99 + 142 + 10 + 65 = 644. This is greater than my outside offer of 510.\n\n*Offer 3: Give 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nThis may seem a bit greedy since it offers nothing.\n\nMy value: (5 * 82) + (4 * 33) + (2 * 71) + (5 * 5) + (1 * 65) = 410 + 132 + 142 + 25 + 65 = 774\n\nOffer 2 seems like a reasonable start, giving the other player some value while keeping a significant portion for myself, and it is greater than my outside offer.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 510. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 510. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 5 + 33 x 3 + 71 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 65 x 0\n    which is 509 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 510. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 510\n   - Item values: item 1: 82, item 2: 33, item 3: 71, item 4: 5, item 5: 65\n   - Total items: item 1: 5, item 2: 4, item 3: 2, item 4: 5, item 5: 1\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [0, 1, 0, 4, 1] means I receive 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. This means Player 2 receives the remainder of each item.\n\n   My value if I accept the current offer:\n   (0 * 82) + (1 * 33) + (0 * 71) + (4 * 5) + (1 * 65) = 0 + 33 + 0 + 20 + 65 = 118\n\n   Adjusted for the discount factor, the value of accepting the current offer is 118 * 0.9 = 106.2. This is much less than my outside offer of 510.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to create an offer that gives me a value greater than 510. Let's start by trying to keep most of the high-value items for myself.\n\n   -Let's examine Player 1's prior offer from round 1 of [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]. If I was going to accept the offer from round 1, my value would have been, [5-1, 4-1, 2-0, 5-3, 1-0], [4, 3, 2, 2, 1]. Let's calculate the value of these items to me in round 1, which would have been (4 * 82) + (3 * 33) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 5) + (1 * 65) = 328 + 99 + 142 + 10 + 65 = 644. 644 > 510, so in round 1 it would have been correct to accept the offer, provided Player 2 values the items I gave them greater or equal to 0. (This is always true, due to uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101)\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is worth 106.2, which is less than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away gives me 510.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that is worth more than 510 to me. Since I'm in round 2, I need to factor in the 0.9 discount. So ideally, the counter offer I accept is > 510/0.9 = 566.66.\n   - Let's aim to keep at least [3, 3, 1, 1, 0] for myself and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n   Value of this offer to me: (3 * 82) + (3 * 33) + (1 * 71) + (1 * 5) + (0 * 65) = 246 + 99 + 71 + 5 + 0 = 421. This is less than 510, therefore, not ideal.\n\n   Let's aim to keep at least [4, 3, 1, 1, 1] for myself and offer the rest to Player 2.\n   Value of this offer to me: (4 * 82) + (3 * 33) + (1 * 71) + (1 * 5) + (1 * 65) = 328 + 99 + 71 + 5 + 65 = 568. This is greater than 510. 568*0.9 = 511.2.\n   My offer will be [1, 1, 1, 4, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 4, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 5 + 33 x 3 + 71 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 65 x 0\n    which is 509 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 510. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 4, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 4, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in round 3.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 510\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 82, Item 2: 33, Item 3: 71, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 65\n*   **Total items:** 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  Since this is round 3, the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81 if we reach an agreement in this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 4, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value from this offer: (0 * 82) + (1 * 33) + (0 * 71) + (4 * 5) + (0 * 65) = 0 + 33 + 0 + 20 + 0 = 53\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 53 * 0.81 = 42.93.  This is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, any counteroffer from player 2 will be treated as a walk. As such I will calculate the total value to me of accepting the previous offers in round 1 and 2 to check against my counteroffer value of 510\n\n    *Round 1 offer for me:\n\n    Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]\n    Player 1 Value from Round 1 offer of the item left to them:\n    Items allocated to player 1: [4, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n    Value of round 1 offer to Player 1: (4 * 82) + (3 * 33) + (2 * 71) + (2 * 5) + (1 * 65) = 328 + 99 + 142 + 10 + 65 = 644\n    Discounted value of round 1 offer: 644 * 0.81 = 521.64.\n\n   *Round 2 offer for me:\n\n   Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 4, 0]\n    Player 1 Value from Round 2 offer of the item left to them:\n    Items allocated to player 1: [5, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n    Value of round 2 offer to Player 1: (5 * 82) + (3 * 33) + (2 * 71) + (1 * 5) + (1 * 65) = 410 + 99 + 142 + 5 + 65 = 721\n    Discounted value of round 2 offer: 721 * 0.81 = 584.01.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer (Player 2's offer in Round 2) would give me a discounted value of 42.93, which is much lower than my outside offer of 510.\n*   Walking away would give me my outside offer value of 510.\n*   If I accept Player 2's Round 1 or 2 offer, my discounted value would be higher than my outside offer (521.64 and 584.01 respectively).\n\n    If this wasn't the last round, I could potentially make a better offer. However, since Player 2's counteroffer will be treated as a walk, it is more beneficial for me to make a counteroffer that reflects Round 2 values (the best current offer) instead of walking.\n\nLet me calculate what a \"fair\" division of items between the two players would look like. I'll first consider what I would be happy with, something higher than the current 42.93. We want to avoid Mistake 2.\nI should first look at the Round 1 offer for me again, and see if this is better than the outside offer value\n*Round 1 offer for me:\nPlayer 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 4, 0]\nPlayer 1 Value from Round 1 offer of the item left to them:\nItems allocated to player 1: [5, 3, 2, 1, 1]\nValue of round 1 offer to Player 1: (5 * 82) + (3 * 33) + (2 * 71) + (1 * 5) + (1 * 65) = 410 + 99 + 142 + 5 + 65 = 721\nValue of round 1 offer to Player 1 Discounted: 721 * 0.81 = 584.01\n\nItems to player 2: [0, 1, 0, 4, 0] - Items offered from Round 2\nItems to player 1: [5, 3, 2, 1, 1] - Items given to Player 1\n\nI can offer to match round 2's items offering [0, 1, 0, 4, 0]. If it gets treated as a walk then that's fine.\nHowever, Player 2's Round 1 and Round 2 offers gives me more.\n\nI can offer to match round 1's items offering [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]. If it gets treated as a walk then that's fine.\nSince both Round 1 and 2 offers results in a discounted value higher than the outside offer of 510, it would be great if Player 2 can accept that.\nSince Round 2 offers the greatest return, I can offer that.\n\n**Final Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 4, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action for Player 1 in Round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 211\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 11\n    *   Item 2: 30\n    *   Item 3: 42\n    *   Item 4: 44\n    *   Item 5: 75\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 5 units\n    *   Item 3: 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  The later the deal is made, the less it is worth.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  We need to explore potential divisions. The key is to offer Player 2 enough to be attractive to them, while still securing a value greater than our outside offer of 211. Since we don't know Player 2's values, we need to make a reasonable initial offer. I will start by trying to secure slightly more than my outside offer.\n\nLet's consider an initial offer where I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit\n\nMy value would be:\n    2 * 11 + 3 * 30 + 3 * 42 + 2 * 44 + 1 * 75 = 22 + 90 + 126 + 88 + 75 = 401\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer. So, I would offer the remaining items to Player 2:\n    * Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    * Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2\n    * Item 3: 5 - 3 = 2\n    * Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n    * Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1\nSo, the offer to player 2 is [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I should propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 986. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 5, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 4 + 3 x 5 + 64 x 5 + 37 x 3 + 77 x 2\n    which is 976 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 986. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

My goal is to find a division of items that gives me a value greater than 1010.\n\nLet's try an initial offer where I give the other player half of each item where applicable, rounded down. So I offer them 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5.\n\nThen I keep: 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\nMy value would be: (4 * 58) + (3 * 39) + (2 * 25) + (1 * 79) + (2 * 47) = 232 + 117 + 50 + 79 + 94 = 572.

How about offering them: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5.\nThen I keep: 6 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\nMy value would be: (6 * 58) + (5 * 39) + (4 * 25) + (2 * 79) + (3 * 47) = 348 + 195 + 100 + 158 + 141 = 942.

To get above 1010, I need to prioritize items with high values, like item 4 (79). I will ensure I keep all of it. Let's also keep most of item 1 (58): offer 1 of item 1.\nI offer: 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5.\nThen I keep: 6 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\nValue = 6*58 + 5*39 + 4*25 + 2*79 + 3*47 = 348 + 195 + 100 + 158 + 141 = 942\n\nLet's keep all of item 1, item 4, item 5. offer: 0,1,1,0,0\nvalue = 7*58 + 5*39 + 3*25 + 2*79 + 3*47 = 406 + 195 + 75 + 158 + 141 = 975\noffer 0 0 0 0\nvalue = 7*58 + 6*39 + 4*25 + 2*79 + 3*47 = 406 + 234 + 100 + 158 + 141 = 1039\n\nI will offer nothing and keep everything.\nI offer: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5.\nThen I keep: 7 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5.\nMy value would be: (7 * 58) + (6 * 39) + (4 * 25) + (2 * 79) + (3 * 47) = 406 + 234 + 100 + 158 + 141 = 1039.

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Since there is no current offer on the table, there is nothing to ACCEPT.\n*   I need to consider potential counteroffers.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not WALK immediately, as there's a chance to get a better deal through negotiation.\n*   I need to make an initial offer. My goal is to get as much value as possible, but I also need to make an offer that Player 2 might accept.\n\nLet's think about a reasonable starting offer. I want to keep most of the items, especially those with high value to me. I'll start by offering Player 2 a small amount of each item and see how they respond. Let's try offering the following:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 0 units\n*   Item 3: 1 units\n*   Item 4: 1 units\n*   Item 5: 1 units\n\nThis means I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units\n*   Item 2: 1 units\n*   Item 3: 1 units\n*   Item 4: 1 units\n*   Item 5: 1 units\n\nMy value for this would be:\n\n*   3 \\* 81 = 243\n*   1 \\* 34 = 34\n*   1 \\* 50 = 50\n*   1 \\* 5 = 5\n*   1 \\* 74 = 74\n*   Total = 406\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 444. Let's offer a better offer for myself.\n\nLet's keep:\n*   Item 1: 4 units\n*   Item 2: 1 units\n*   Item 3: 2 units\n*   Item 4: 1 units\n*   Item 5: 1 units\n\nThis means I'm offering:\n\n*   Item 1: 1 units\n*   Item 2: 0 units\n*   Item 3: 0 units\n*   Item 4: 1 units\n*   Item 5: 1 units\n\nMy value for this would be:\n\n*   4 \\* 81 = 324\n*   1 \\* 34 = 34\n*   2 \\* 50 = 100\n*   1 \\* 5 = 5\n*   1 \\* 74 = 74\n*   Total = 537\n\nThis is higher than my outside offer value of 444.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 583. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 583. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1182 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 4 + 93 x 1 + 88 x 1 + 56 x 0 + 76 x 1\n    which is 581 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 583. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

They also want all of items 2 and 3. I should consider this in my counteroffer.\n\nI'll adjust slightly to make my offer more attractive to them while still maintaining good value for myself:\n\nIf I offer [2, 0, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1 (keeping [3, 1, 1, 1, 2] for myself):\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 88 = 88\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n- Total value = 632\n\nThis is still above my outside offer of 583, and gives Player 1 more of item 1 which they seem to value, along with one unit of item 3 which they also wanted.\n\n## Step 4: Make a decision\n\nBased on my analysis:\n- The current offer values at 213, which is well below my outside offer of 583\n- My counteroffer of [2, 0, 1, 1, 0] gives me a value of 632, which is above my outside offer\n- This counteroffer gives Player 1 some items they seem to value while still giving me good value\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]}",

This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value.\n\n2) **Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer (to me):** [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This means I receive:\n    *   2 units of Item 1\n    *   0 units of Item 2\n    *   1 unit of Item 3\n    *   1 unit of Item 4\n    *   0 units of Item 5\n    My value for this offer is: (2 * 81) + (0 * 34) + (1 * 50) + (1 * 5) + (0 * 74) = 162 + 0 + 50 + 5 + 0 = 217\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 217 * 0.9 = 195.3. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 444.\n\n*   **Consider walking away:** My outside option is 444.\n\n*   **Consider making a Counteroffer:** I need to determine a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 444, even after discounting by 0.9. That means the undiscounted value must be greater than 444/0.9 = 493.33\n\nLet's analyze different potential counteroffers. I will start by aiming to get as much of the high-value items as possible while still leaving the other player with something.\n\n*   **Counteroffer Attempt 1:** Offer Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all items:\n    *   5 units of Item 1\n    *   1 unit of Item 2\n    *   2 units of Item 3\n    *   2 units of Item 4\n    *   2 units of Item 5\n    My value for this is: (5 * 81) + (1 * 34) + (2 * 50) + (2 * 5) + (2 * 74) = 405 + 34 + 100 + 10 + 148 = 697. This is much larger than my outside option 444. So, even discounted it would be acceptable.\n\n*   **Counteroffer Attempt 2:** Give up one unit of item 1. Offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   4 units of Item 1\n    *   1 unit of Item 2\n    *   2 units of Item 3\n    *   2 units of Item 4\n    *   2 units of Item 5\n    My value for this is: (4 * 81) + (1 * 34) + (2 * 50) + (2 * 5) + (2 * 74) = 324 + 34 + 100 + 10 + 148 = 616.\n\n*   **Counteroffer Attempt 3:** Offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 1].

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 4 + 93 x 1 + 88 x 1 + 56 x 0 + 76 x 1\n    which is 581 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 583. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This round is round 3, so the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]. This means I keep:\n     - Item 1: 1\n     - Item 2: 0\n     - Item 3: 0\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 0\n     Player 2 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. Therefore, I would get:\n     (1 * 81) + (0 * 34) + (0 * 50) + (1 * 5) + (0 * 74) = 81 + 0 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 86\n     Since this is round 3, we need to discount the value by 0.81. Thus, the discounted value is 86 * 0.81 = 69.66.\n     Since 69.66 is significantly less than my outside offer of 444, accepting is not a good option.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep everything. This means I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2. The value to me is:\n     (5 * 81) + (1 * 34) + (2 * 50) + (2 * 5) + (2 * 74) = 405 + 34 + 100 + 10 + 148 = 697.\n     Discounted value = 697 * 0.81 = 564.57\n\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer is worth 69.66, which is much less than my outside offer of 444. Keeping everything is worth 564.57, which is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is bad (69.66 < 444).\n   - Walking away gets me 444.\n   - A counteroffer where I keep everything gets me 564.57.\n   - It is the final round, so if I make a counteroffer, it will be treated as a WALK.\n\nTherefore, since it is the final round and any counteroffer is treated as a WALK, I need to compare the current offer with my outside option. The current offer (discounted value) is 69.66, and my outside option is 444. Since 444 > 69.66, I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round. Since it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect the immediate decision, but it will in later rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   There is no current offer.\n*   Potential counteroffers: I need to propose an offer that gives Player 2 some items. I will start with an offer that's slightly better than my outside offer to see if I can get Player 2 to accept.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should propose a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider an initial counteroffer. I want to keep as much of item 5 as possible since it has the highest value. I also want to keep as much of item 4 as possible. Let's try offering Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nThis means I keep: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy value would be:\n2 * 4 + 3 * 25 + 1 * 18 + 2 * 44 + 2 * 93 = 8 + 75 + 18 + 88 + 186 = 375\n\nThis is much less than my outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 977. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 951 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me. An offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  The value to me is (0 \\* 4) + (1 \\* 25) + (1 \\* 18) + (0 \\* 44) + (0 \\* 93) = 43. Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 43 * 0.9 = 38.7. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 432.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 432 / 0.9 = 480 to make it worthwhile to counteroffer.\n\nLet's try to find a good counteroffer. I want to keep as much of item 5 (value 93) and item 4 (value 44) as possible. Suppose I keep all of item 5 (2 units) and all of item 4 (3 units). Then I value those at 2\\*93 + 3\\*44 = 186+132 = 318. I need to make at least 480 - 318 = 162 from the remaining items: items 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's keep all items of type 1 (4 units) and item type 2 (5 units). This would give me an additional value of 4*4 + 5*25 = 16 + 125 = 141. In this case, I give player 2 0 units of item 1 and item 2. Then I need to obtain 480 - 318 - 141 = 21 from item 3. Since I only have two units of item 3 (value 18) I cannot do this.\n\nLet's try a different counteroffer where I keep all units of item 5 (2) and 2 units of item 4. I value this at 2\\*93 + 2\\*44 = 186 + 88 = 274. Then I need 480 - 274 = 206 from item 1, 2, and 3. I keep all item type 2 (5) which give me an additional 5\\*25 = 125. Then I have 206 - 125 = 81 from item 1 and 3. I keep all item type 3 which gives me additional 2\\*18 = 36. In this case, I need 81 - 36 = 45 from item 1. So, this counteroffer is not feasible.\n\nHere is a feasible counteroffer: offer 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5 to Player 2. Then I keep 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5. The total value is 3*4 + 4*25 + 2*18 + 3*44 + 2*93 = 12 + 100 + 36 + 132 + 186 = 466.\nHowever, the discounted value is 466 \\* 0.9 = 419.4 < 432. It is still less than outside option.\n\nLet me try another offer: offer 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 unit of item 5 to Player 2. Then I keep 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.

In this case it makes sense to make a counter offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nSince offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to the other player yields a value greater than my outside offer (discounted), I will make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 0, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 4 + 68 x 4 + 25 x 0 + 97 x 3 + 51 x 2\n    which is 969 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 977. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If I were to accept this, my value would be 0, which is far below my outside offer of 977.\n\nMy previous offer was [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], meaning I would keep [4, 4, 1, 3, 2], which has a value to me of:\n- 4 \u00d7 76 = 304 (item 1)\n- 4 \u00d7 68 = 272 (item 2)\n- 1 \u00d7 25 = 25 (item 3)\n- 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (item 4)\n- 2 \u00d7 51 = 102 (item 5)\nTotal: 994, which is better than my outside offer of 977.\n\nPlayer 1's first offer was [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], meaning they would take 1 unit of items 1 and 2. This suggests they might value these items.\n\nLet me consider a new counteroffer. Given that we're in round 2, the offer needs to be good enough for both of us, but I need to ensure I get at least my outside offer value.\n\nLet me try offering Player 1 slightly more than my previous offer, but still ensuring I stay above my outside offer:\nIf I offer [1, 1, 1, 0, 0], I would keep [3, 4, 1, 3, 2], which has a value to me of:\n- 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (item 1)\n- 4 \u00d7 68 = 272 (item 2)\n- 1 \u00d7 25 = 25 (item 3)\n- 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (item 4)\n- 2 \u00d7 51 = 102 (item 5)\nTotal: 918\n\nWith the discount factor of 0.9, this would be 918 \u00d7 0.9 = 826.2, which is less than my outside offer.\n\nLet me try another offer: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1], meaning I would keep [4, 4, 1, 3, 1], which has a value to me of:\n- 4 \u00d7 76 = 304 (item 1)\n- 4 \u00d7 68 = 272 (item 2)\n- 1 \u00d7 25 = 25 (item 3)\n- 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (item 4)\n- 1 \u00d7 51 = 51 (item 5)\nTotal: 943\n\nWith the discount factor of 0.9, this would be 943 \u00d7 0.9 = 848.7, which is still less than my outside offer.\n\nStep 3: Make a decision\nGiven that Player 1's offer is extremely unfavorable to me (they're offering me nothing), and I can't create a counteroffer that both gives more to Player 1 and maintains my value above my outside offer after the discount factor, the best decision is to WALK away.\n\nIf I WALK, I get my outside offer of 977, which is better than any discounted deal I could make at this point.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 0 + 62 x 2 + 63 x 1 + 26 x 5 + 9 x 3\n    which is 344 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 345. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation carefully to make the best decision for myself.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 345\n- My values for items: \n  - Item 1: 52 per unit (1 total unit)\n  - Item 2: 62 per unit (3 total units)\n  - Item 3: 63 per unit (1 total unit)\n  - Item 4: 26 per unit (7 total units)\n  - Item 5: 9 per unit (3 total units)\n- Total pool: [1, 3, 1, 7, 3]\n- We're in round 1, so the discount factor is 1.0 (\u03b3^(1-1) = 1)\n\n## Step 2: Assess the value of the current offer\n\nPlayer 1 has offered me [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], meaning they want to keep [1, 3, 1, 6, 3] for themselves.\n\nValue for me if I accept:\n- Item 4: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n- Total value: 26\n\nThis is far below my outside offer of 345, so accepting would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate potential counteroffers\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that:\n- Keeps enough value for me (above 345)\n- Might be appealing to Player 1\n\nPlayer 1's first offer was extremely one-sided, keeping almost everything. This suggests they value these items.\n\nLet me calculate what I'd get if I keep:\n- Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 52 = 52\n- Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 62 = 186\n- Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 63 = 63\n- Item 4: 6 units \u00d7 26 = 156\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\nTotal: 466\n\nThis would mean offering Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nThis keeps me above my outside offer (466 > 345), and only gives Player 1 a small portion of items.\n\nLet me consider another option:\n- Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 52 = 52\n- Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 62 = 124\n- Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 63 = 63\n- Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 26 = 130\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\nTotal: 378\n\nThis would mean offering Player 1: [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]\n\nThis also keeps me above my outside offer (378 > 345) and might be more appealing to Player 1.\n\n## Step 4: Make a decision\n\nI should not accept the current offer as it's worth only 26 to me, which is much less than my outside offer of 345.\n\nLooking at my original values for all items:\n- Item 1: 52 (medium value)\n- Item 2: 62 (high value)\n- Item 3: 63 (highest value)\n- Item 4: 26 (low value)\n- Item 5: 9 (lowest value)\n\nSince Player 1 offered me only 1 unit of Item 4, which is among my lower-valued items, I should counteroffer giving them some of my lower-valued items (like items 4 and 5) while keeping my higher-valued items.\n\nI'll go with the second option, offering Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 2, 2], which gives me a value of 378 (above my outside offer of 345) and gives Player 1 a more substantial offer than what I received.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]}",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 946.\n*   My values for the items are: 92 (item 1), 61 (item 2), 32 (item 3), 86 (item 4), 47 (item 5).\n*   The total pool of items is: 1 (item 1), 3 (item 2), 1 (item 3), 7 (item 4), 3 (item 5).\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer in a later round is worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   2 units of item 5\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 92) + (1 * 61) + (0 * 32) + (2 * 86) + (2 * 47) = 0 + 61 + 0 + 172 + 94 = 327.\n\n    Since 327 is much less than my outside offer of 946, accepting is not a good idea.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to come up with an offer that leaves me with a value greater than 946. I currently have:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   7 units of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n    If I offer [0, 2, 0, 5, 1] to Player 2, I will keep [1, 1, 1, 2, 2].

I need to propose a better offer for myself.\n\n    If I offer [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] to Player 2, I will keep [1, 3, 1, 4, 3]. The value will be: (1 * 92) + (3 * 61) + (1 * 32) + (4 * 86) + (3 * 47) = 92 + 183 + 32 + 344 + 141 = 792 < 946.\n\n    If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2, I keep everything. The value will be: (1 * 92) + (3 * 61) + (1 * 32) + (7 * 86) + (3 * 47) = 92 + 183 + 32 + 602 + 141 = 1050. This is greater than 946.\n\n    If I offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] to Player 2, I keep [1, 3, 1, 6, 3]. The value will be: (1 * 92) + (3 * 61) + (1 * 32) + (6 * 86) + (3 * 47) = 92 + 183 + 32 + 516 + 141 = 964. Which is greater than my outside offer of 946.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is bad. Offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] could be seen as offering nothing (Mistake 3). It also leaves nothing for the other player, so might be rejected.\nOffering [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] is a decent start. It is better than my outside offer and it might get accepted.\nI will make the offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] as a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 795. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 1 + 78 x 4 + 17 x 0 + 92 x 5 + 93 x 0\n    which is 794 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 795. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 795\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 22, Item 2: 78, Item 3: 17, Item 4: 92, Item 5: 93\n*   **Total Item Pool:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount Factor:** 0.9 (This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now). Since it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't directly impact the immediate decision, but it will factor into later rounds if no agreement is reached.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** There is no current offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to determine what offer to make to Player 2. My goal is to maximize my value, but also to make an offer attractive enough for Player 2 to accept (potentially in a later round). I should consider how much of each item I am willing to give away, keeping in mind my value for each item and my outside offer.\n\n    I need to make an offer that gives me more than 795. Let's start by calculating the total value of all the items to me:\n\n    (2 * 22) + (4 * 78) + (2 * 17) + (5 * 92) + (4 * 93) = 44 + 312 + 34 + 460 + 372 = 1222\n\n    So, my target is to keep items worth more than 795. Let me consider giving the other player half of the total number of each item (or slightly more if necessary to get over the threshold).\n    Offer of [1, 2, 1, 2, 2] means I keep [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]\n    Value = 1 * 22 + 2 * 78 + 1 * 17 + 3 * 92 + 2 * 93 = 22 + 156 + 17 + 276 + 186 = 657 (Too low)\n\n    Let's try an offer of [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] (leaving me with [2, 3, 2, 4, 3])\n    Value = 2 * 22 + 3 * 78 + 2 * 17 + 4 * 92 + 3 * 93 = 44 + 234 + 34 + 368 + 279 = 959 (Acceptable)\n\n    Let's try an offer of [0, 1, 0, 2, 1] (leaving me with [2, 3, 2, 3, 3])\n    Value = 2 * 22 + 3 * 78 + 2 * 17 + 3 * 92 + 3 * 93 = 44 + 234 + 34 + 276 + 279 = 867\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is None. I want to make a counteroffer that is advantageous to me, but also has a chance of being accepted by Player 2.\n\nI'll propose giving Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This means I keep 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. This gives me a value of 867 which is greater than my outside offer of 795.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 795. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 906 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 1 + 78 x 4 + 17 x 0 + 92 x 5 + 93 x 0\n    which is 794 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 795. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, I should not accept it.\n\n    Let's consider a possible counteroffer. I need to keep enough items to be better than my outside offer. How about giving the other player only a small amount?\n\n    Counteroffer: Give Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] (0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5)\n    This means I keep 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n    My value: (2 \\* 22) + (3 \\* 78) + (2 \\* 17) + (5 \\* 92) + (4 \\* 93) = 44 + 234 + 34 + 460 + 372 = 1144\n    Discounted value in round 2: 1144 \\* 0.9 = 1029.6\n\n    This offer is good for me, so I will propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

The discount factor means that offers accepted in later rounds are worth less to both players. Since it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't significantly affect my immediate decision, but it means I should try to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: There is no current offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to calculate the value of different proposed divisions. I want to find an offer that is both appealing to Player 2 (so they accept it) and yields a value greater than my outside offer of 288.\n\n3) **Develop a strategy and make a decision:**\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's values, I want to make a reasonable offer that maximizes my potential gain while minimizing the risk of a walkaway. Items 2 and 5 have the highest values for me.\n\nHere's an example calculation of a potential offer: I will propose to give Player 2 half of the items.\n\n*   Item 1: Give 3, Keep 3. Value: 3 * 9 = 27\n*   Item 2: Give 2, Keep 2. Value: 2 * 67 = 134\n*   Item 3: Give 2, Keep 3. Value: 3 * 30 = 90\n*   Item 4: Give 2, Keep 2. Value: 2 * 28 = 56\n*   Item 5: Give 2, Keep 2. Value: 2 * 40 = 80\n\nTotal value to me: 27 + 134 + 90 + 56 + 80 = 387\n\nThis value of 387 is greater than my outside option of 288, so the offer is reasonable so far. The offer to Player 2 is [3, 2, 2, 2, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 2 + 76 x 0 + 87 x 2 + 51 x 2 + 98 x 1\n    which is 524 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 525. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I'll analyze this situation step-by-step to determine my best action.\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n\n- My outside offer value: 525\n- My item values: 75 (item 1), 76 (item 2), 87 (item 3), 51 (item 4), 98 (item 5)\n- Total pool: 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.9 (each round reduces value by 10%)\n- Current round: 1 (no discount yet)\n\n### 2) Assessing Current Offer:\n\nPlayer 1 offered me [3, 2, 2, 2, 2], meaning they keep [3, 2, 3, 2, 2]\n\nValue to me if I accept:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n\nTotal value to me: 849\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 525, so accepting would be better than walking away.\n\n### 3) Exploring Potential Counteroffers:\n\nSince this is round 1, I should try to improve my position. I notice item 5 is most valuable to me (98 per unit), followed by item 3 (87), item 2 (76), item 1 (75), and item 4 (51).\n\nLet me try offering Player 1 fewer of my high-value items:\n\nPotential counteroffer [3, 2, 2, 3, 1] (giving Player 1 these amounts):\n- I keep: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n- Value to me: (3\u00d775) + (2\u00d776) + (3\u00d787) + (1\u00d751) + (3\u00d798) = 225 + 152 + 261 + 51 + 294 = 983\n\nThis is better than my outside offer (525) and better than the current offer (849).\n\n### 4) Decision:\n\nThe current offer (849) is already good, but I can try for better. My counteroffer of [3, 2, 2, 3, 1] would give me a value of 983, which is significantly better than both my outside offer and Player 1's current offer.\n\nSince this is only round 1, I'll make this counteroffer. If Player 1 rejects it, I can still accept their original offer in round 2 (which would be worth 849 \u00d7 0.9 = 764.1, still better than my outside offer).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 3, 1]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 2 + 76 x 0 + 87 x 2 + 51 x 2 + 98 x 1\n    which is 524 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 525. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 2, 3, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Any counteroffer might risk further value reduction from the discount factor or potential walkaway.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This aligns with my strategy since my highest value items are 1 and 3.\n\nMy counteroffer is reasonable - I'm giving them 1 unit each of items 1, 2, and 0 of item 3, plus most of items 4 and 5 which I don't value as highly.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 461. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 461. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 540 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 2, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 3 + 41 x 1 + 12 x 2 + 30 x 5 + 46 x 2\n    which is 460 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 461. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 4, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 4, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of an offer accepted now (round 2), and an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of an offer accepted in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 2 of item 5. My value for this offer is (0 * 7) + (0 * 28) + (0 * 78) + (0 * 17) + (2 * 91) = 182.\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** 182 is significantly greater than my outside offer of 29.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few options. First, consider keeping all the item 5 and see how we can divide the other items while making sure to get more than the outside offer.\n   - Current Items: 4 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n   - Since they offered 2 of Item 5, and there are 6, that means I keep 4. The value from that alone is 364.\n   - Suppose I keep 3 of Item 4. Add 3*17=51 to our running total.\n   - Suppose I keep 2 of Item 3. Add 2*78=156 to our running total.\n   - Suppose I keep 0 of Item 2. Add 0*28=0 to our running total.\n   - Suppose I keep 3 of Item 1. Add 3*7=21 to our running total.\n   - Total Value: 364+51+156+0+21 = 592. Offer the rest. Offer: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]. This is better than outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer yields a value of 182, which is greater than my outside offer of 29. However, perhaps I can get an even better deal.\n   - Walking away yields a value of 29.\n   - Let's propose the counteroffer [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]. This leaves me with a value of 592, which is much higher than my outside offer and higher than accepting.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 985. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 985. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 3, 4, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 4 + 3 x 1 + 63 x 3 + 65 x 4 + 28 x 6\n    which is 984 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 985. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 474. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 1 + 100 x 1 + 11 x 4 + 43 x 2 + 64 x 3\n    which is 473 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 474. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I am Player 1 and it's my turn to make the first offer.\n   - I need to consider potential counteroffers. Let's start by considering an equal split (or as close to equal as possible, given the unit counts).\n\n3) **Making a Decision:**\n\n   - Since it is round 1 and I have no current offer to accept or reject, I must either walk away or propose a counteroffer.\n   - I want to make an initial offer that is reasonable, but also leaves room for negotiation. I want to make sure the value of items I keep is higher than my outside offer.\n   - Let's consider offering Player 2 half of each item if possible, then adjust for units that cannot be split. The goal is to find some offer where the items I keep are worth more than 578.\n\n    *   **Item 1:** Total 13, offer 6, keep 7. Value = 7 * 75 = 525\n    *   **Item 2:** Total 4, offer 2, keep 2.

This means I would receive:\n- 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 31 = 186\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\nTotal value of current offer to me = 318\n\nThe remaining items (what Player 1 keeps) would be [7, 2, 2, 2, 1].\n\n### 3) Comparing to my outside offer:\nThe current offer is worth 318 to me, which is greater than my outside offer of 216, so I should not walk away.\n\n### 4) Considering a counteroffer:\nI should create a counteroffer that improves my position while still being potentially acceptable to Player 1.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I want to keep more of the valuable items:\nIf I offer Player 1 [7, 1, 2, 3, 0], that means I keep [6, 3, 1, 1, 1]:\n- 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 31 = 186\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 11 = 11\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\nTotal value to me = 397\n\nThis counteroffer would be worth 397 to me, which is significantly better than both the current offer (318) and my outside offer (216).\n\nI'm improving my position by getting more of item 2 (my second most valuable item) and item 5 (my most valuable item), while giving Player 1 more of item 1, item 3, and item 4 (my less valuable items).\n\nSince this is round 1, I'll make this counteroffer to see how Player 1 responds.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [7, 1, 2, 3, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 3, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 4 + 13 x 0 + 31 x 3 + 46 x 4 + 76 x 0\n    which is 577 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 578. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [6, 2, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [7, 1, 2, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [7, 1, 2, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 105. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 2 + 57 x 0 + 42 x 2 + 97 x 0 + 54 x 0\n    which is 102 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 105. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 4, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 105\n*   **Item values:** Item 1 = 9, Item 2 = 57, Item 3 = 42, Item 4 = 97, Item 5 = 54\n*   **Total items:** 2 of Item 1, 5 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 3 of Item 4, 6 of Item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.9 times its actual value, and accepting in round 3 gives me 0.9^2 times its actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 4, 0, 0, 2]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    My value for this offer is: (1 \\* 9) + (4 \\* 57) + (0 \\* 42) + (0 \\* 97) + (2 \\* 54) = 9 + 228 + 0 + 0 + 108 = 345\n    Since it's round 2, the discounted value is 345 * 0.9 = 310.5\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 310.5 > 105, so accepting the current offer is better than walking away *at this round*.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's evaluate if a counteroffer would be better. I currently have, in total: 2 units of Item 1, 5 units of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4 and 6 units of Item 5.\n    The current offer means that the other player is receiving 1 unit of Item 1, 4 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4 and 2 units of Item 5.\n    So, if I accept the current offer, the other player gets [1, 4, 0, 0, 2] and I get [1, 1, 3, 3, 4].\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 310.5.\n*   If I walk away, I get 105.\n*   If I make a counteroffer, it will only be accepted if it's beneficial to both parties, otherwise, it's likely the negotiation concludes on round 3 with one of us walking away. Round 3 means a discount factor of 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n    I need to consider whether any counteroffer would be valuable enough that it would make a difference given the discount factor.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that is only slightly better than the current offer for me and hope they accept it. I am receiving [1, 4, 0, 0, 2] currently, and they have [1, 1, 3, 3, 4].\n\nLet me try to get one more unit of Item 3 from them:\nCounteroffer: [1, 4, 1, 0, 2].\nValue to me: (1 \\* 9) + (4 \\* 57) + (1 \\* 42) + (0 \\* 97) + (2 \\* 54) = 9 + 228 + 42 + 0 + 108 = 387\nDiscounted value: 387 * 0.9 = 348.3\n\nOkay, offering [1, 4, 1, 0, 2] will increase my discounted value to 348.3. If they refuse it, the negotiation ends and I get 105.\nSince 348.3 is much larger than 105, it's worth making the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 611. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 8, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 1 + 58 x 1 + 23 x 8 + 72 x 3 + 64 x 2\n    which is 610 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 611. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I will start by exploring a possible split where I keep a majority of the items.\n\n**3) Constructing an initial offer**\nI will start with an initial offer, giving Player 2 a small amount of each item to see how they respond. I will try to find an offer that gives Player 2 something, but allows me to keep enough items to exceed my outside option value.\nLet's say I offer Player 2 [1, 0, 2, 0, 0].

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 611. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 723 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 8, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 1 + 58 x 1 + 23 x 8 + 72 x 3 + 64 x 2\n    which is 610 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 611. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 5, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 5, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 611.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 24, item 2 = 58, item 3 = 23, item 4 = 72, item 5 = 64.\n   - Total items: 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its actual value, and accepting in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times its actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [3, 1, 5, 0, 1]. This means I would receive:\n      - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 24 = 72\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 58 = 58\n      - 5 units of item 3: 5 * 23 = 115\n      - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 72 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 64 = 64\n      - Total value: 72 + 58 + 115 + 0 + 64 = 309\n      - Discounted value (round 2): 309 * 0.9 = 278.1\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would get to keep if I made a counteroffer.  Let's first consider what the maximum possible value I can get is. That is to keep all of the items.\n   - 5 units of item 1: 5 * 24 = 120\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 58 = 116\n   - 9 units of item 3: 9 * 23 = 207\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 72 = 216\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 64 = 192\n   - Total value: 120 + 116 + 207 + 216 + 192 = 851\n   - Discounted Value in this round if I keep everything = 851 * .9 = 765.9\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer has a discounted value of 278.1, which is much less than my outside offer of 611. Therefore, I should not accept this.\n   - If I walk away, I get 611.\n   - I believe there is room for a better deal than my outside offer.\n   - Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 0] in round 1, meaning I would get the rest. Player 2 then offered [3, 1, 5, 0, 1].\n\nLet's calculate the values of some potential offers to me.\n- Offer everything to Player 2: My value = 0\n- Offer nothing to Player 2: Value = 765.9 discounted.\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that results in a discounted value of > 611. So my total value > 611/0.9 = 678.89\nLet's try offering Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep all the items, which would get me 765.9.\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would keep 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nValue = 4*24 + 2*58 + 9*23 + 3*72 + 3*64 = 96 + 116 + 207 + 216 + 192 = 827\n827 * 0.9 = 744.3, which is better than my outside offer\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would keep 4 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nValue = 4*24 + 1*58 + 9*23 + 3*72 + 3*64 = 96 + 58 + 207 + 216 + 192 = 769\n769 * 0.9 = 692.1, which is better than my outside offer\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would keep 4 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nValue = 4*24 + 1*58 + 8*23 + 3*72 + 3*64 = 96 + 58 + 184 + 216 + 192 = 746\n746 * 0.9 = 671.4, which is better than my outside offer\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]. This means I would keep 4 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nValue = 4*24 + 1*58 + 7*23 + 3*72 + 3*64 = 96 + 58 + 161 + 216 + 192 = 723\n723 * 0.9 = 650.7, which is better than my outside offer\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 1, 3, 0, 0]. This means I would keep 4 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nValue = 4*24 + 1*58 + 6*23 + 3*72 + 3*64 = 96 + 58 + 138 + 216 + 192 = 700\n700 * 0.9 = 630, which is better than my outside offer\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [2, 1, 3, 0, 0]. This means I would keep 3 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nValue = 3*24 + 1*58 + 6*23 + 3*72 + 3*64 = 72 + 58 + 138 + 216 + 192 = 676\n676 * 0.9 = 608.4, which is worse than my outside offer.\n\nSo, I know I must offer no more than [1, 1, 3, 0, 0] to player 2. I will offer player 2: [1, 1, 3, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 8, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 1 + 58 x 1 + 23 x 8 + 72 x 3 + 64 x 2\n    which is 610 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 611. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 5, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 6, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 6, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 22 x 0 + 74 x 0 + 34 x 0 + 23 x 1\n    which is 23 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 24. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 24.\n   - My item values are: item 1 = 63, item 2 = 22, item 3 = 74, item 4 = 34, item 5 = 23.\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. Since it's round 2, the discount factor will be applied as 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]. This means I keep:\n     - Item 1: 1 unit (2 - 1)\n     - Item 2: 3 units (4 - 1)\n     - Item 3: 1 unit (2 - 1)\n     - Item 4: 2 units (3 - 1)\n     - Item 5: 2 units (5 - 3)\n     My value for this offer is: (1 * 63) + (3 * 22) + (1 * 74) + (2 * 34) + (2 * 23) = 63 + 66 + 74 + 68 + 46 = 317.\n     Since this is round 2, we must discount this value: 317 * 0.9 = 285.3\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of accepting the current offer (285.3) is much higher than my outside offer (24).\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to ensure any counteroffer I make is better than my outside offer.\n     * Let's examine the offer from Round 1 by Player 1: [1, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n     This means that I would keep the following:\n          *Item 1:* 2 - 1 = 1\n          *Item 2:* 4 - 2 = 2\n          *Item 3:* 2 - 1 = 1\n          *Item 4:* 3 - 1 = 2\n          *Item 5:* 5 - 3 = 2\n\n     The value for this would be:\n     (1 * 63) + (2 * 22) + (1 * 74) + (2 * 34) + (2 * 23) = 63 + 44 + 74 + 68 + 46 = 295\n     Applying discount factor = 295 * 0.9 = 265.5\n     This offer would still be better than my outside option. \n     \n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   The current offer on the table ([1, 1, 1, 1, 3]) gives me a discounted value of 285.3, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 24.

This is greater than my outside offer of 661.\n\nI should consider making an offer that maximizes my value while still being reasonable enough for Player 2 to accept. Offer 2 gives me a value of 880, which is well above my outside offer. Offering nothing initially seems too aggressive, and might cause player 2 to walk away.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - I will propose offer 2, giving Player 2 [2, 0, 0, 2, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation carefully to make an optimal decision.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 684\n- My item values: 66 for item 1, 19 for item 2, 30 for item 3, 28 for item 4, 11 for item 5\n- Total pool: 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.9 (affects future rounds)\n\n## Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\nFirst, let me calculate the value of Player 1's current offer to me:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n- Total value to me: 210\n\nThis is far below my outside offer of 684.\n\nIf I accept this in round 1, I get the full value: 210 \u00d7 0.9^(1-1) = 210.\n\nBased on what Player 1 offered me, they seem to value:\n- Item 1: Medium (kept 4 of 6)\n- Items 2 and 3: High (kept all units)\n- Item 4: Medium (kept 4 of 6)\n- Item 5: High (kept 6 of 8)\n\nLet me consider a counteroffer. I highly value item 1, so I should keep most of that. Items 2 and 3 have moderate value to me, and item 5 is low value.\n\nI'll propose a counteroffer where I keep most of item 1 (which I value highly), some of item 4, and a fair distribution of the others:\n\nMy proposed counteroffer to Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 3, 5]\n\nLet me calculate my value if this counteroffer is accepted:\n- I keep 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 66 = 330\n- I keep 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n- I keep 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n- I keep 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n- I keep 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n- Total value to me: 496\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 684. Let me improve my counteroffer.\n\nI'll adjust to keep more high-value items:\n\nMy revised counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 2, 6]\n\nLet me calculate my value if this is accepted:\n- I keep 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 66 = 396\n- I keep 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n- I keep 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n- I keep 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n- I keep 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n- Total value to me: 628\n\nStill below my outside offer. Let me try once more:\n\nMy final counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 1, 7]\n\nWith this offer:\n- I keep 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 66 = 396\n- I keep 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n- I keep 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n- I keep 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 28 = 140\n- I keep 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 11 = 11\n- Total value to me: 645\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 684, but very close. I should consider that if we go to round 2, the discount factor will reduce my final value to 90% of the agreed value. If I hold out for a better deal, the discount factor may make it worse than an immediate agreement.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure I don't make mistake #2 (offering worse than my outside offer).\n\nLet me make one final adjustment. I need to offer fewer items to reach above my outside offer:\n\nMy final counteroffer to Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7]\n\nWith this offer:\n- I keep 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 66 = 396\n- I keep 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n- I keep 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n- I keep 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 28 = 168\n- I keep 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 11 = 11\n- Total value to me: 673 + 11 = 684\n\nThis equals my outside offer value. Considering the discount factor in future rounds, this is a reasonable offer.\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nI should not accept the current offer as it's far below my outside offer (210 vs 684).\nI should make a counteroffer that preserves my value while giving Player 1 items I value less.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 7]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 661. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 1, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party.

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 32 for item 1, 5 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 25 for item 4, 86 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1166. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 661. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 661. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 633 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 1, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 1 + 5 x 2 + 63 x 1 + 25 x 5 + 86 x 5\n    which is 660 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 661. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 7]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 661\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 32, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 63, Item 4: 25, Item 5: 86\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 8\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 3, the discount factor will be 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 5]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 0 = 6\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 0 = 6\n    *   Item 5: 8 - 5 = 3\n    My value for this offer is: (6 * 32) + (2 * 5) + (2 * 63) + (6 * 25) + (3 * 86) = 192 + 10 + 126 + 150 + 258 = 736\n    Since this is round 3, the discounted value is 736 * 0.81 = 596.16.  This is LESS than my outside offer of 661.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to propose an offer that gives me a discounted value GREATER than 661/0.81 = 816.05. I can either make a counteroffer or walk.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer, even with the discount factor, gives me a value less than my outside offer. Therefore, I should not accept the current offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince it is the last round, if I propose a counteroffer, it will automatically be considered as a walk. Therefore, it's whether to accept the current offer or walk. The current offer gives me a discounted value of 596.16, while walking away gives me 661.\n\nTherefore, I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
