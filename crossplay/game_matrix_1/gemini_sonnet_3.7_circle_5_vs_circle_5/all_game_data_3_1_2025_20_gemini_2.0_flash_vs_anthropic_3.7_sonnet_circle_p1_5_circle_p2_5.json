Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 339. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 753 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 48 x 1 + 3 x 4 + 90 x 2 + 98 x 1\n    which is 338 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 339. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 0 + 33 x 1 + 28 x 2 + 31 x 2 + 22 x 0\n    which is 151 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 152. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I want to make an offer that gives Player 2 enough to be enticing but still leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer.\n\nLet's start with a conservative offer, giving a small amount of each item to Player 2. I will offer Player 2 the following: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nThis means I keep: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(2 * 39) + (3 * 33) + (5 * 28) + (3 * 31) + (2 * 22) = 78 + 99 + 140 + 93 + 44 = 454\n\nSince 454 > 152, this offer is better than walking away immediately.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1324. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 4, 7, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 1 + 37 x 5 + 10 x 4 + 94 x 7 + 71 x 6\n    which is 1323 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1324. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 2, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 151. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 151. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 98 x 1 + 57 x 0 + 52 x 1 + 15 x 0\n    which is 150 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 151.

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assessment of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer.\n   - I need to come up with an offer that is better than walking away and getting my outside offer value of 151.\n   - I need to determine a reasonable split of items, considering my values and the total quantity of each item. I will start by offering half of each item if possible. Since quantities aren't always divisible by 2, I'll round down.\n\n3) **Initial Counteroffer Strategy:**\n    Since there is no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. I will make an offer that gives the other player a portion of each item, keeping the rest for myself. I will start by offering close to half of the available items to Player 2. The offer must be carefully designed such that my remaining items are worth more than my outside option of 151.\n\n4) **Constructing a Counteroffer:**\n\nLet's consider an initial offer:\n- Item 1: Offer 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- Item 2: Offer 3 (keeping 3 for myself)\n- Item 3: Offer 1 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- Item 4: Offer 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\n- Item 5: Offer 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\n\nValue of items I keep:\n- 2 * 58 (Item 1) = 116\n- 3 * 98 (Item 2) = 294\n- 2 * 57 (Item 3) = 114\n- 2 * 52 (Item 4) = 104\n- 2 * 15 (Item 5) = 30\nTotal value = 116 + 294 + 114 + 104 + 30 = 658\n\nSince 658 > 151, this offer is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 151. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 98 x 1 + 57 x 0 + 52 x 1 + 15 x 0\n    which is 150 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 151. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 151\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 58, Item 2: 98, Item 3: 57, Item 4: 52, Item 5: 15\n*   **Total Items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value, and an offer in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (0 * 58) + (1 * 98) + (1 * 57) + (0 * 52) + (0 * 15) = 98 + 57 = 155\n    *   Discounted value of current offer (round 2): 155 * 0.9 = 139.5\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (139.5) is less than my outside offer (151). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 151 / 0.9 = 167.78 to make it worthwhile in this round. I want to keep as much of item 2 as possible, since it has the highest value for me.\n\nLet's consider a few possible counteroffers. First, calculate what I currently have.\nI am offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]. So I currently have:\nItem 1: 4-0 = 4\nItem 2: 6-1 = 5\nItem 3: 3-1 = 2\nItem 4: 4-0 = 4\nItem 5: 4-0 = 4\nMy current value is 4*58 + 5*98 + 2*57 + 4*52 + 4*15 = 232+490+114+208+60 = 1104\n\nNow let's try to create an offer that is better than my outside offer.\n\nTry to give away everything except item 2. If I only keep one of item 2, and give everything else away, it would be giving [4, 5, 2, 4, 4] away. That means I get 1*98 = 98, which is less than 151.\nIf I keep 2 of item 2, that is 2*98 = 196, which is greater than 151. I would have to offer [4, 4, 3, 4, 4].\nThis means I have 2*98 + 4*58 + 0*57 + 0*52 + 0*15 = 196 + 0+0+0+ 232 = 428.\nThe value of this discounted to the current round would be 428 * 0.9 = 385.2\n\nLet's try a different offer.\nI will offer the same as Player 2's offer [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]. They will have 4+0, 6-1, 3-1, 4+0, 4+0. That gives me [4, 5, 2, 4, 4]\nMy value here is 4*58 + 5*98 + 2*57 + 4*52 + 4*15 = 232 + 490 + 114 + 208 + 60 = 1104.\nDiscount this by the number of rounds: 1104*0.9=993.6\n\nAnother offer: Offer [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nPlayer 2 gets item 1=1, item 2=2, item 3=1, item 4=1, item 5 = 1\nI get item 1=3, item 2=4, item 3=2, item 4=3, item 5 = 3\nValue for me is 3*58 + 4*98 + 2*57 + 3*52 + 3*15 = 174 + 392 + 114 + 156 + 45 = 881\n881*0.9 = 792.9. This seems like a good offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. I will make a counteroffer of [1, 2, 1, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1496. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1119 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 7, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 2 + 79 x 4 + 99 x 7 + 48 x 4 + 87 x 2\n    which is 1495 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1496. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1496\n*   **Item values:**\n    *   Item 1: 60\n    *   Item 2: 79\n    *   Item 3: 99\n    *   Item 4: 48\n    *   Item 5: 87\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 7\n    *   Item 4: 5\n    *   Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer. Let's consider a few possibilities, keeping in mind I want to maximize my value above 1496. To do that, I must calculate my value of keeping the items that are *not* in the offer.\n\n    *   **Offer 1 (Even Split):** Offer Player 2 half of each item (rounding where necessary)\n        *   Offer: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] to Player 2\n        *   Keep: [2, 3, 4, 3, 1] for myself\n        *   My Value: (2 * 60) + (3 * 79) + (4 * 99) + (3 * 48) + (1 * 87) = 120 + 237 + 396 + 144 + 87 = 984. This is way below the outside offer.\n\n    *   **Offer 2 (Generous to me):** Offer small amounts to player 2. Let's try offering Player 2 just 1 unit of each item, keeping the rest.\n        * Offer: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2\n        * Keep: [2, 4, 6, 4, 1] for myself\n        * My Value: (2 * 60) + (4 * 79) + (6 * 99) + (4 * 48) + (1 * 87) = 120 + 316 + 594 + 192 + 87 = 1309. This is still below the outside offer.\n\n   *   **Offer 3 (More Generous to me):** Offer even smaller amounts to player 2. Let's try offering Player 2 zero of some items.\n        * Offer: [0, 1, 2, 1, 0] to Player 2\n        * Keep: [3, 4, 5, 4, 2] for myself\n        * My Value: (3 * 60) + (4 * 79) + (5 * 99) + (4 * 48) + (2 * 87) = 180 + 316 + 495 + 192 + 174 = 1357. This is still below the outside offer.\n\n    *   **Offer 4 (More Generous to me):** Offer even smaller amounts to player 2. Let's try offering Player 2 zero of some items and small amounts of others.\n        * Offer: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 2\n        * Keep: [3, 5, 6, 5, 2] for myself\n        * My Value: (3 * 60) + (5 * 79) + (6 * 99) + (5 * 48) + (2 * 87) = 180 + 395 + 594 + 240 + 174 = 1583. This offer results in a value above my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 2 gives me a value of 1583, which is higher than my outside offer of 1496.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer of [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 453. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 453. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 0 + 39 x 1 + 52 x 2 + 72 x 4 + 21 x 1\n    which is 452 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 453. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 5, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Accept Player 1's offer: Value = 0 (worse than outside offer)\n2. Walk away: Value = 453 (outside offer)\n3.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 774. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 4, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 2 + 100 x 4 + 13 x 4 + 72 x 0 + 53 x 4\n    which is 768 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 774. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and in round 3, it is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 2, 4, 0, 0]. This means:\n    *   0 units of item 1: 0 * 52 = 0\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 100 = 200\n    *   4 units of item 3: 4 * 13 = 52\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 72 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 53 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 200 + 52 + 0 + 0 = 252\n    *   Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 252 * 0.9 = 226.8. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 774. So, accepting this offer is a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 774, after discounting by 0.9. Let's consider some scenarios:\n    *   **Keeping all items:** 2 * 52 + 4 * 100 + 4 * 13 + 1 * 72 + 4 * 53 = 104 + 400 + 52 + 72 + 212 = 840.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 452. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 0 + 60 x 1 + 53 x 4 + 23 x 3 + 55 x 2\n    which is 451 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 452. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less to me.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer.\n   - I need to propose an initial offer to Player 2.\n   - I want to maximize my value while ensuring Player 2 also gets a reasonable offer to avoid them walking away.\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\nSince there's no offer to accept, I need to make a counteroffer. I want to make an offer that is better than my outside offer, but also attractive enough to Player 2.\n\nI will start by calculating the total value of all items to me.\nTotal value = (3 * 80) + (3 * 60) + (4 * 53) + (3 * 23) + (5 * 55) = 240 + 180 + 212 + 69 + 275 = 976\n\nNow, let's consider some possible offers and calculate my value if Player 2 accepts.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 452. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 3 + 86 x 2 + 36 x 0 + 59 x 1 + 28 x 3\n    which is 375 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 376. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best course of action in this negotiation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **My outside offer value:** 376\n   - **Values of the items:**\n     - Item 1: 20\n     - Item 2: 86\n     - Item 3: 36\n     - Item 4: 59\n     - Item 5: 28\n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - Item 1: 4\n     - Item 2: 4\n     - Item 3: 0\n     - Item 4: 2\n     - Item 5: 3\n   - **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1. This incentivizes making a deal sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer to Player 2. The key is to find a division of items that gives me a value greater than my outside offer (376), while also being potentially acceptable to Player 2. I need to consider the discount factor.\n\n3) **Consider some potential counteroffers:**\n\nHere's a systematic exploration of offers that might be valuable:\n\n*Offer 1 (Generous initial offer):* Give Player 2 half of the items, rounded down.\n   Offer: [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n   What I keep: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n   My value: (2 * 20) + (2 * 86) + (0 * 36) + (1 * 59) + (2 * 28) = 40 + 172 + 0 + 59 + 56 = 327.  This is LESS than my outside offer.  Mistake #2.\n*Offer 2 (Keeping more valuable items):* Let's keep all of Item 2, most of item 4, and a couple of items 1 and 5.\n   Offer: [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n   What I keep: [2, 4, 0, 2, 2]\n   My value: (2 * 20) + (4 * 86) + (0 * 36) + (2 * 59) + (2 * 28) = 40 + 344 + 0 + 118 + 56 = 558. This is GREATER than my outside offer.\n\n*Offer 3 (More Balanced Offer):*\n   Offer: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n   What I keep: [3, 3, 0, 2, 2]\n   My value: (3 * 20) + (3 * 86) + (0 * 36) + (2 * 59) + (2 * 28) = 60 + 258 + 0 + 118 + 56 = 492. This is GREATER than my outside offer.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n\nOffer 2 and Offer 3 both give me more than my outside offer. Offer 2 gives me a greater initial return, and also probably gives more to player 2 than their outside offer, making it more likely to be accepted.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 3 + 86 x 2 + 36 x 0 + 59 x 1 + 28 x 3\n    which is 375 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 376. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 376\n*   **My item values:** item 1: 20, item 2: 86, item 3: 36, item 4: 59, item 5: 28\n*   **Total item pool:** item 1: 4, item 2: 4, item 3: 0, item 4: 2, item 5: 3\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 2, 0, 0, 2]. This means I would receive 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (2 * 20) + (2 * 86) + (0 * 36) + (0 * 59) + (2 * 28) = 40 + 172 + 0 + 0 + 56 = 268\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 268 * 0.9 = 241.2\n    *   Since 241.2 < 376 (my outside offer), accepting the current offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n*   **Consider keeping all items:** This would be worth 4*20 + 4*86 + 0*36 + 2*59 + 3*28 = 80 + 344 + 0 + 118 + 84 = 626. This is the maximum possible value for me.\n\n*   **Previous Offer:** In the previous round, I offered the other player [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This would mean I would get [2, 4, 0, 2, 2]. The value of this to me would be:\n    * 2*20 + 4*86 + 0*36 + 2*59 + 2*28 = 40 + 344 + 0 + 118 + 56 = 558\n\n*   **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to calculate an offer that's better than my outside offer when discounted by 0.9. Let's aim for a value above 376/0.9 = 417.78.\n\n    Let's consider offering the other player the minimum of Item 2. Giving 0 units of Item 2 would get me to at least: 4 * 20 + 4 * 86 + 0 * 36 + 2 * 59 + 3 * 28 = 626. So the minimum value to offer the other player is 1 unit of item 2, so that I get a value lower than 626. This strategy doesn't work, as offering them the minimum value of 1 unit of item 2 yields me an outcome of 626 - 86 = 540.\n\n    What if I were to offer them [0,1,0,1,1]? My value will be: 4*20 + 3*86 + 0*36 + 1*59 + 2*28 = 80 + 258 + 0 + 59 + 56 = 453.\n    Discounted value would be 453 * 0.9 = 407.7, which is still greater than my outside offer.\n\n    What if I were to offer them [0,2,0,1,1]? My value will be: 4*20 + 2*86 + 0*36 + 1*59 + 2*28 = 80 + 172 + 0 + 59 + 56 = 367.\n    Discounted value would be 367 * 0.9 = 330.3, which is less than my outside offer, and making this offer would be Mistake 2.\n\n    So, what if I propose [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]?\n    Then my value = 4 * 20 + 3 * 86 + 0 * 36 + 2 * 59 + 3 * 28 = 80 + 258 + 0 + 118 + 84 = 540.\n    Discounted value = 540 * 0.9 = 486, which is good!\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is bad (241.2 < 376). I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a discounted value greater than 376. I will offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 4 + 79 x 1 + 65 x 0 + 67 x 2 + 23 x 0\n    which is 485 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 506.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 4 + 79 x 1 + 65 x 0 + 67 x 2 + 23 x 0\n    which is 485 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 506. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 506\n*   My item values: Item 1: 68, Item 2: 79, Item 3: 65, Item 4: 67, Item 5: 23\n*   Total items: Item 1: 4, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 0\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 3 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 0 - 0 = 0\n    My value for this: (3 * 68) + (1 * 79) + (3 * 65) + (1 * 67) + (0 * 23) = 204 + 79 + 195 + 67 + 0 = 545\n    Adjusted value for round 2: 545 * 0.9 = 490.5\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer, discounted, is worth 490.5, which is *less* than my outside offer of 506. Thus, accepting the current offer is not optimal.\n\nNow, let's consider some counteroffers. I need to offer *more* items to Player 2 so that I keep less items for myself, but still ensure what I keep is worth more than my discounted outside offer in round 3: 506 * 0.9^2 = 410.94. This means in the last round, what is left after the offer needs to be at least worth 410.94 in order to beat WALKing away.\n\nLet's start by making an offer slightly more generous than Player 2's previous offer. Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]. My original offer was [1,0,0,1,0]. Let's consider offering [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\n*   **Counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]:** I offer Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 0 - 0 = 0\n    My value for this: (3 * 68) + (1 * 79) + (2 * 65) + (2 * 67) + (0 * 23) = 204 + 79 + 130 + 134 + 0 = 547\n\nThis offer is still not accepted, let's make an offer which brings the value down to the outside offer level.\n\nIn order to beat 506 I need to offer more to Player 2 so that I keep less items for myself. For instance, let's try offering:\n*  **Counteroffer [2, 0, 1, 3, 0]:** I offer Player 2 2 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 3 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 0 - 0 = 0\n    My value for this: (2 * 68) + (1 * 79) + (2 * 65) + (1 * 67) + (0 * 23) = 136 + 79 + 130 + 67 + 0 = 412\n\nThis is above the threshold of 410.94 and is likely the highest offer I can make for this to beat 506.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current discounted offer (490.5) is less than my outside offer (506), I will not accept.\nI will propose a counteroffer: [2, 0, 1, 3, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 3, 0]}\n```",

This means that waiting for a later round reduces the value of any deal by 10% per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** We need to consider various possible counteroffers. The goal is to maximize our value while making the offer attractive enough for Player 2 to accept. Let's consider a few options and their values. Since we're in Round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so we don't need to worry about that yet.\n\n    *   **Option 1:** Offer Player 2 half of each item type (or as close as possible).\n        *   Item 1: Give 2, Keep 2 -> 2 * 80 = 160\n        *   Item 2: Give 2, Keep 2 -> 2 * 34 = 68\n        *   Item 3: Give 2, Keep 2 -> 2 * 15 = 30\n        *   Item 4: Give 2, Keep 3 -> 3 * 61 = 183\n        *   Item 5: Give 1, Keep 1 -> 1 * 52 = 52\n        *   Total value: 160 + 68 + 30 + 183 + 52 = 493\n\n    *   **Option 2:** Offer Player 2 a slightly better offer to increase the chance of acceptance.\n        *   Item 1: Give 1, Keep 3 -> 3 * 80 = 240\n        *   Item 2: Give 1, Keep 3 -> 3 * 34 = 102\n        *   Item 3: Give 1, Keep 3 -> 3 * 15 = 45\n        *   Item 4: Give 1, Keep 4 -> 4 * 61 = 244\n        *   Item 5: Give 0, Keep 2 -> 2 * 52 = 104\n        * Giving the opponent: [1,1,1,1,0]\n        *   Total value: 240+102+45+244+104 = 735\n\n    *   **Option 3:** Offer Player 2 a moderate amount: [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n        *  Keep 3 of item 1: 3 * 80 = 240\n        *  Keep 2 of item 2: 2 * 34 = 68\n        *  Keep 3 of item 3: 3 * 15 = 45\n        *  Keep 4 of item 4: 4 * 61 = 244\n        *  Keep 1 of item 5: 1 * 52 = 52\n        *   Total value: 240 + 68 + 45 + 244 + 52 = 649\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The goal is to get a value significantly higher than the outside offer of 41 while creating an offer acceptable to Player 2.\n\n    Option 2 yields a high value (735), and seems to be a reasonable starting point. It offers a bit from each item type, and gives us a good return.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the counteroffer in Option 2: offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 4, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 2 + 40 x 2 + 70 x 4 + 79 x 2 + 11 x 2\n    which is 562 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 563. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 4, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 2 + 40 x 2 + 70 x 4 + 79 x 2 + 11 x 2\n    which is 562 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 563. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 3, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 382 / 0.9 = 424.44. Since my total value is 618, I can start by considering giving away the items I value the least.\n\n    Let's consider an offer where I give away all of item 1, all of item 2, one of item 3, and zero of items 4 and 5. That means keeping 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 6 of item 5. The offer to player 2 would then be [3, 2, 1, 0, 0]. The value to me would be (2 * 25) + (1 * 40) + (6 * 69) = 50 + 40 + 414 = 504. This offer would net me 504 * 0.9 = 453.6, which is better than my outside offer of 382.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   Accepting the current offer is terrible.\n    *   Walking away is not ideal, because I can make a better offer for myself.\n    *   I should propose a counteroffer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 67 x 1 + 4 x 0 + 10 x 1 + 60 x 2\n    which is 197 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 198. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 81 x 0 + 81 x 3 + 94 x 2 + 33 x 1\n    which is 464 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 465. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Given my values (particularly the high values for items 2, 3, and 4), this is an excellent offer for me.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 1, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 2 + 50 x 2 + 4 x 1 + 15 x 1 + 69 x 4\n    which is 577 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 579. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 579.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 91, item 2 = 50, item 3 = 4, item 4 = 15, item 5 = 69.\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1. Accepting in round 3 would be worth 0.81 times the undiscounted value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 4]. This means I receive:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 91 = 182\n      - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 50 = 50\n      - 0 units of item 3: 0 * 4 = 0\n      - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 15 = 15\n      - 4 units of item 5: 4 * 69 = 276\n      - Total value: 182 + 50 + 0 + 15 + 276 = 523\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (523) is less than my outside offer (579). Therefore, accepting is not a good option *right now* without considering the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discounted outside offer value is 579 * 0.9 = 521.1\n\n   - Let's see what keeping all of the items gives us\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 91 = 182\n      - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 50 = 150\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 4 = 8\n      - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 15 = 45\n      - 4 units of item 5: 4 * 69 = 276\n      - Total value: 182 + 150 + 8 + 45 + 276 = 661\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that gives me more than 521.1 now.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I should NOT accept the current offer as 523 < 579. But 523 > 521.1.\n   - I should NOT walk away. If no agreement is reached in round 3, the value to both players would be the same as walking away now.\n   - I need to create a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer if I want to make an offer.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give the other player all of items 3 and 4, and a portion of item 1, 2, and 5. I could offer: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]. This means I keep:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 91 = 182\n      - 2 units of item 2: 2 * 50 = 100\n      - 0 units of item 3: 0 * 4 = 0\n      - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 15 = 0\n      - 4 units of item 5: 4 * 69 = 276\n      - Total value: 182 + 100 + 0 + 0 + 276 = 558\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 579.\n\nNow, try offering [0, 0, 2, 3, 0], like Player 1 did in round 1. I keep:\n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 91 = 182\n      - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 50 = 150\n      - 0 units of item 3: 0 * 4 = 0\n      - 0 units of item 4: 0 * 15 = 0\n      - 4 units of item 5: 4 * 69 = 276\n      - Total value: 182 + 150 + 0 + 0 + 276 = 608\nThis is greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 3, 0]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 855\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 90, Item 2: 77, Item 3: 34, Item 4: 19, Item 5: 91\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 6, Item 5: 6\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** We need to find a counteroffer that is better than our outside option. Let's consider a relatively even split and calculate the value for myself. If I give Player 2 half the items where possible:\n    *   Item 1: Give 1, Keep 1: 1 * 90 = 90\n    *   Item 2: Give 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    *   Item 3: Give 2, Keep 3: 3 * 34 = 102\n    *   Item 4: Give 3, Keep 3: 3 * 19 = 57\n    *   Item 5: Give 3, Keep 3: 3 * 91 = 273\n    *   Total Value: 90 + 77 + 102 + 57 + 273 = 599. This is much lower than 855.\n\n    Let's try offering less to the other player. I want to keep most of the items with high value to me.\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * Item 3: Offer 2, Keep 3: 3 * 34 = 102\n    * Item 4: Offer 3, Keep 3: 3 * 19 = 57\n    * Item 5: Offer 2, Keep 4: 4 * 91 = 364\n    * Total Value: 180 + 77 + 102 + 57 + 364 = 780. Still less than my outside option.\n\n    Let's try offering even less:\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * Item 3: Offer 3, Keep 2: 2 * 34 = 68\n    * Item 4: Offer 4, Keep 2: 2 * 19 = 38\n    * Item 5: Offer 4, Keep 2: 2 * 91 = 182\n    * Total Value: 180 + 77 + 68 + 38 + 182 = 545. This is far too low, let's go back to offering less.\n\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * Item 3: Offer 4, Keep 1: 1 * 34 = 34\n    * Item 4: Offer 5, Keep 1: 1 * 19 = 19\n    * Item 5: Offer 5, Keep 1: 1 * 91 = 91\n    * Total Value: 180 + 77 + 34 + 19 + 91 = 401. Very low.\n\n    It's clear I need to keep most of item 1 and item 5 since these are my highest value items.\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 1, Keep 0: 0 * 77 = 0\n    * Item 3: Offer 5, Keep 0: 0 * 34 = 0\n    * Item 4: Offer 6, Keep 0: 0 * 19 = 0\n    * Item 5: Offer 0, Keep 6: 6 * 91 = 546\n    * Total Value: 180 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 546 = 726\n\n    Still less than my outside offer. So, lets keep some of the item with the second-highest value for me:\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * Item 3: Offer 5, Keep 0: 0 * 34 = 0\n    * Item 4: Offer 6, Keep 0: 0 * 19 = 0\n    * Item 5: Offer 0, Keep 6: 6 * 91 = 546\n    * Total Value: 180 + 77 + 0 + 0 + 546 = 803\n\n    And finally:\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * Item 3: Offer 4, Keep 1: 1 * 34 = 34\n    * Item 4: Offer 5, Keep 1: 1 * 19 = 19\n    * Item 5: Offer 1, Keep 5: 5 * 91 = 455\n    * Total Value: 180 + 77 + 34 + 19 + 455 = 765\n\n    Still less than my outside option, let's keep just a little less of items 3 and 4:\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * Item 3: Offer 5, Keep 0: 0 * 34 = 0\n    * Item 4: Offer 6, Keep 0: 0 * 19 = 0\n    * Item 5: Offer 1, Keep 5: 5 * 91 = 455\n    * Total Value: 180 + 77 + 0 + 0 + 455 = 712\n\n    Let's try one last offer:\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * Item 3: Offer 3, Keep 2: 2 * 34 = 68\n    * Item 4: Offer 4, Keep 2: 2 * 19 = 38\n    * Item 5: Offer 2, Keep 4: 4 * 91 = 364\n    * Total Value: 180 + 77 + 68 + 38 + 364 = 727\n\n    Still low, so let's try something that keeps more of the valuable items:\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * Item 3: Offer 5, Keep 0: 0 * 34 = 0\n    * Item 4: Offer 5, Keep 1: 1 * 19 = 19\n    * Item 5: Offer 0, Keep 6: 6 * 91 = 546\n    * Total Value: 180 + 77 + 0 + 19 + 546 = 822\n\n    Getting closer to the outside offer.\n\n    Okay, let's try something more aggressive with item 5.\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * Item 3: Offer 5, Keep 0: 0 * 34 = 0\n    * Item 4: Offer 6, Keep 0: 0 * 19 = 0\n    * Item 5: Offer 2, Keep 4: 4 * 91 = 364\n    * Total Value: 180 + 77 + 0 + 0 + 364 = 621\n\n    Let's try one where I keep all the valuable items.\n\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * Item 3: Offer 5, Keep 0: 0 * 34 = 0\n    * Item 4: Offer 6, Keep 0: 0 * 19 = 0\n    * Item 5: Offer 3, Keep 3: 3 * 91 = 273\n    * Total Value: 180 + 77 + 0 + 0 + 273 = 530\n\n    Okay, given how far away I am from my outside offer, I'm going to make an initial offer that keeps all the high-value items for myself and gives a little of the lower-value items to Player 2.\n    * Item 1: Offer 0, Keep 2: 2 * 90 = 180\n    * Item 2: Offer 0, Keep 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n    * Item 3: Offer 3, Keep 2: 2 * 34 = 68\n    * Item 4: Offer 4, Keep 2: 2 * 19 = 38\n    * Item 5: Offer 2, Keep 4: 4 * 91 = 364\n    * Total Value: 180 + 77 + 68 + 38 + 364 = 727\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 4, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 337. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 708 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 0 + 32 x 0 + 14 x 4 + 53 x 2 + 87 x 2\n    which is 336 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 337. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 855\n*   **My values of the items:** 90 (item 1), 77 (item 2), 34 (item 3), 19 (item 4), 91 (item 5)\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 (item 1), 1 (item 2), 5 (item 3), 6 (item 4), 6 (item 5)\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.9 * value, and accepting in round 3 gives me 0.9^2 * value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [1, 1, 4, 3, 2] (This is what I receive)\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 90) + (1 * 77) + (4 * 34) + (3 * 19) + (2 * 91) = 90 + 77 + 136 + 57 + 182 = 542\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 542 * 0.9 = 487.8\n    *   Since 487.8 < 855, accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Round 1 offer:** Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 4, 2].\n    This means Player 2 gets 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 2 of item 5, leaving me with 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 4 of item 5.\n    Value to me of round 1 offer = 2 * 90 + 1 * 77 + 2 * 34 + 2 * 19 + 4 * 91 = 180 + 77 + 68 + 38 + 364 = 727\n    Discounted value = 727 * 0.9 = 654.3\n    Since 654.3 < 855, the original offer was worse than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find an offer that is better than 855 when discounted. I have 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4 and 6 units of item 5 available in total.\n\nI am going to consider a few cases of different counteroffers.\nIf I give away only item 4 and item 5 to Player 2:\n*   Keep: 2 x 90 + 1 x 77 + 5 x 34 = 180 + 77 + 170 = 427, leaving nothing for item 4 and item 5.\n*   This option gives 427 now, which is much less than 855.\n\nLet's consider giving away only the less valuable items 3 and 4. Let's see if keeping the other items is better than 855.\n* Keeping: 2 x 90 + 1 x 77 + 6 x 91 = 180 + 77 + 546 = 803, leaving nothing for items 3 and 4.\n* Offering all of items 3 and 4 to Player 2: 803 * 0.9 + (5 * 34) * 0.9 + (6 * 19) * 0.9 = 722.7 + 153 + 102.6 = 978.3\n* This may lead to a good offer. But I need to see what I offer to the other player as a result.\n\nLet me instead propose an offer that gives player 2 item 1, item 2 and half of item 5.\nI would keep all of items 3 and 4. This is because they are the least valuable.\nI propose to offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 3]\nMy value of items after this offer is made to Player 2: (1 * 90) + (0 * 77) + (5 * 34) + (6 * 19) + (3 * 91) = 90 + 0 + 170 + 114 + 273 = 647\nDiscounted value: 647 * 0.9 = 582.3, still bad.\n\nLet's try offering just item 4 completely, plus 1 of item 5 to the other player.\nThat means offering [0, 0, 0, 6, 1].\nMy value = 2 * 90 + 1 * 77 + 5 * 34 + 5 * 91 = 180 + 77 + 170 + 455 = 882\nDiscounted value = 882 * 0.9 = 793.8. Still not as good as outside offer.\n\nLet's try giving just item 4. I offer [0, 0, 0, 6, 0] to Player 2.\nMy value is 2 * 90 + 1 * 77 + 5 * 34 + 6 * 91 = 180 + 77 + 170 + 546 = 973.\nDiscounted value is 973 * 0.9 = 875.7\nThis is greater than 855.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\nI should make the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 6, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 217. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 1 + 100 x 1 + 59 x 0 + 21 x 0 + 43 x 1\n    which is 210 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 217. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 531. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 669 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 5, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 1 + 3 x 2 + 64 x 5 + 47 x 2 + 92 x 1\n    which is 529 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 531. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 531\n*   **Item values:** Item 1 = 17, Item 2 = 3, Item 3 = 64, Item 4 = 47, Item 5 = 92\n*   **Total items:** 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]. This means Player 2 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. If I accept this, I keep: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept: (2 * 17) + (2 * 3) + (5 * 64) + (2 * 47) + (3 * 92) = 34 + 6 + 320 + 94 + 276 = 730\n    *   Since 730 > 531, accepting this offer is better than walking away *right now*. However, we are in round 2, so the discounted value is 730 * 0.9^(2-1) = 730 * 0.9 = 657.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that I find acceptable (greater than my outside offer of 531 after discounting) but is also likely to be accepted by Player 2. Since Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 0], it suggests that player values items 4 more than the other items. I will start by making a counteroffer where I keep most valuable items for myself. I will offer [0,0,2,2,1] to the other player. This means I keep: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for counteroffer: (2 * 17) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 64) + (2 * 47) + (2 * 92) = 34 + 6 + 192 + 94 + 184 = 510\n    *   The discounted value is 510 * 0.9 = 459. This is still less than the outside offer!\n\n    *   Revised Counteroffer: I will offer [0,0,1,1,1] to the other player. This means I keep: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   My value for counteroffer: (2 * 17) + (2 * 3) + (4 * 64) + (3 * 47) + (2 * 92) = 34 + 6 + 256 + 141 + 184 = 621\n    *   The discounted value is 621 * 0.9 = 558.9. This is greater than the outside offer of 531. I will propose this counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is better than my outside offer after discounting.\n*   Proposing a counteroffer [0,0,1,1,1] yields a higher value than my outside offer after discounting, so I should make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 573\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1: 52, Item 2: 73, Item 3: 63, Item 4: 60, Item 5: 29\n*   **Total pool of items:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 6, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 2\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value. This encourages reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer to Player 2. My goal is to maximize my own value while making the offer attractive enough for Player 2 to accept. I need to keep enough items for myself to exceed my outside offer of 573.\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\n\nSince this is round 1 and there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer. I'll start by trying to determine a reasonable split that benefits me while also giving Player 2 a worthwhile deal. Let's start by offering Player 2 half of all items.\n\nOffer: [1, 3, 1, 2, 1] (This means I give Player 2 1 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 1 of item 5)\n\nNow, let's calculate what I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n*   Item 2: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n*   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n*   Item 4: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n*   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n\nMy value for this would be:\n\n(1 * 52) + (3 * 73) + (2 * 63) + (2 * 60) + (1 * 29) = 52 + 219 + 126 + 120 + 29 = 546\n\nSince 546 < 573, this initial offer is not good, as it would result in a value lower than my outside offer. Let's try another offer where I keep more valuable items and offer Player 2 less.\n\nOffer: [0, 2, 0, 1, 0] (This means I give Player 2 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5)\n\nNow, let's calculate what I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n*   Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n*   Item 3: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n*   Item 4: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n*   Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n\nMy value for this would be:\n\n(2 * 52) + (4 * 73) + (3 * 63) + (3 * 60) + (2 * 29) = 104 + 292 + 189 + 180 + 58 = 823\n\nSince 823 > 573, this offer is a possibility.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 338. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 630 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

That is a terrible offer for me.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]. This would mean I get to keep everything.\n\nLet's consider giving back item 2, item 3 and item 5. The other person values the combination of 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3 and 3 units of item 5 quite highly (if they bid that in round 1). Let's try giving that back.\n\nMy counteroffer to player 2 is [0, 5, 3, 0, 3]. This means I keep [4, 0, 0, 3, 1]\nMy value = (4 * 70) + (0 * 63) + (0 * 75) + (3 * 82) + (1 * 8) = 280 + 0 + 0 + 246 + 8 = 534\nMy discounted value is 534 * 0.9 = 480.6. Not enough.\n\nIt seems like I may have made a mistake in Round 1. I need to consider walking away.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer gives me a discounted value of 480.6, which is far less than my outside offer of 1010, I should not accept. I am running out of time, and my best options seem to have already passed by.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",
