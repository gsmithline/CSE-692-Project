This would give me a value of 0.\n\nMy outside offer is 1118, which is my fallback value if I WALK.\n\nLet me calculate the value of my previous offers and see what Player 2 seems to be prioritizing:\n\nMy last offer was [3, 2, 1, 3, 3] - meaning I would keep:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n- 7 units of item 3: 7 \u00d7 94 = 658\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\nTotal value for me: 1152\n\nSince this is the final round, the discount factor is \u03b3\u00b2 = 0.9\u00b2 = 0.81. So the discounted value of this deal would be 1152 \u00d7 0.81 = 933.12.\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 1118, so I should WALK unless I can make a counteroffer that gives me more value.\n\nGiven that Player 2 has consistently been offering me very little, and this is the final round, it's unlikely they'll accept a counteroffer that gives me sufficient value. \n\nSince my outside offer (1118) is higher than the discounted value I could get from my previous offer (933.12), the rational choice is to WALK.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

My private values are 31, 47, 48, 72, 33 respectively.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n* 1 unit of item 1: 1 * 31 = 31\n* 2 units of item 2: 2 * 47 = 94\n* 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 48 = 48\n* 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 72 = 72\n* 1 unit of item 5: 1 * 33 = 33\nTotal value of current offer = 31 + 94 + 48 + 72 + 33 = 278\n\nNow, let's discount this value by gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nDiscounted value of current offer = 278 * 0.9 = 250.2\n\nMy outside offer is 232. Since the discounted value of the current offer (250.2) is greater than my outside offer (232), I should accept if I can't get a better deal.\n\nHowever, let's consider a possible counteroffer. I have 3 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Player 1's offer to me is [1, 2, 1, 1, 1], so the opposite offer is [2, 5, 1, 3, 2] to them. The previous round, Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 1] and I offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This indicates they value item 1 and 3 higher relative to item 2, 4 and 5 than I do.\n\nLet's try to get a bit more out of this deal. It's the second round so I need to make a compelling offer. Let's counter offer with giving them 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. That means I would get 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. This gives me a value of 2*31 + 3*47 + 1*48 + 2*72 + 2*33 = 62 + 141 + 48 + 144 + 66 = 461. 461 * 0.9 = 414.9\n\nSo the counteroffer to Player 1 is [1, 4, 1, 2, 1]. That means I keep [2, 3, 1, 2, 2]. The value to me of my allocation is 2 * 31 + 3 * 47 + 1 * 48 + 2 * 72 + 2 * 33 = 62 + 141 + 48 + 144 + 66 = 461. Discounted value to me = 461*0.9 = 414.9\n\nSince 414.9 is greater than 250.2, this is my preferred outcome.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

A good starting point for a counteroffer is to offer Player 1 just enough that they might accept, but still leave me with a value exceeding my outside option. Since I don't know Player 1's values, this is just an educated guess. Let's aim for a split where I get at least 1400 after the split.\n\nLet's construct an offer that is relatively generous to player 1, but also gives me good value.

(3*58 = 174)\n* Item 3: Give 0 to player 1, keep 3. (3*99 = 297)\n* Item 4: Give 2 to player 1, keep 4. (4*59 = 236)\n* Item 5: Give 2 to player 1, keep 4. (4*44 = 176)\n\nTotal value to me: 224 + 174 + 297 + 236 + 176 = 1107. This is still well below my outside option.\n\nLet's try another offer that is less generous than the above.\n* Item 1: Give 1 to player 1, keep 5. (5*56 = 280)\n* Item 2: Give 0 to player 1, keep 3. (3*58 = 174)\n* Item 3: Give 0 to player 1, keep 3. (3*99 = 297)\n* Item 4: Give 1 to player 1, keep 5. (5*59 = 295)\n* Item 5: Give 1 to player 1, keep 5. (5*44 = 220)\n\nTotal value to me: 280 + 174 + 297 + 295 + 220 = 1266. This is still below my outside option.\n\nLet's try another offer:\n\n* Item 1: Give 0 to player 1, keep 6. (6*56 = 336)\n* Item 2: Give 0 to player 1, keep 3. (3*58 = 174)\n* Item 3: Give 1 to player 1, keep 2. (2*99 = 198)\n* Item 4: Give 0 to player 1, keep 6.

This is still below my outside option.\n\nLet's try an offer which will guarantee my outside offer.\n\n* Item 1: Give 0 to player 1, keep 6. (6*56 = 336)\n* Item 2: Give 0 to player 1, keep 3. (3*58 = 174)\n* Item 3: Give 0 to player 1, keep 3. (3*99 = 297)\n* Item 4: Give 0 to player 1, keep 6. (6*59 = 354)\n* Item 5: Give 1 to player 1, keep 5. (5*44 = 220)\n\nTotal value to me: 336 + 174 + 297 + 354 + 220 = 1381. This is very close to my outside option.\n\nLets make one more counteroffer.\n\n* Item 1: Give 0 to player 1, keep 6.

This means I would receive 5 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of this offer to me:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 * 56 = 280\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 * 58 = 0\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 * 99 = 0\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 * 59 = 236\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 * 44 = 0\nTotal value of the offer: 280 + 0 + 0 + 236 + 0 = 516\n\nNow, I need to discount this value by the discount factor gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nDiscounted value of the offer: 516 * 0.9 = 464.4\n\nMy outside offer is worth 1398. Since the discounted value of Player 1's current offer (464.4) is significantly less than my outside offer, I should not accept it.\n\nNext, I should consider if making a counteroffer would be beneficial. It's round 2, so I have one round to negotiate. I need to determine if there's a possible allocation of items that Player 1 would accept, and that would provide me with a value greater than my outside offer (when discounted).\nLet's think about a possible counteroffer. I want to keep as much of item 3 as possible since it has the highest value for me.\n\nI will consider making a counteroffer that gives player 1 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 4 and 6 units of item 5, keeping the remaining units of each item for myself: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 * 56 = 0\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 * 58 = 0\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 99 = 297\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 * 59 = 0\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 * 44 = 0\nTotal value: 297\n\nDiscounted value: 297 * 0.9 = 267.3.\n\nThis is less than my outside option, so it is not good.\n\nLet's consider offering [2,1,0,2,0].  This means I would keep 4 item 1, 2 item 2, 3 item 3, 4 item 4, 6 item 5.\nValue to me is 4 * 56 + 2 * 58 + 3 * 99 + 4 * 59 + 6 * 44 = 224 + 116 + 297 + 236 + 264 = 1137\nDiscounted Value = 1137 * 0.9 = 1023.3\n\nStill less than my outside option.\n\nGiven these calculations, the best action is to walk away and take my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means I keep 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 1 of item 5.\n\nLet's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n(3 * 48) + (1 * 26) + (1 * 77) + (2 * 66) + (1 * 47) = 144 + 26 + 77 + 132 + 47 = 426.\n\nThe offer is worth 426, which is less than the outside offer.\n\nTo determine if a counteroffer is worthwhile, I need to consider what Player 1's values might be. Since I don't know their values, I need to try to get as much as possible for myself in the hopes that the other player will accept.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer that gives Player 1 only a little bit of each item. I will offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1. This means I keep 8 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of this offer to me:\n(8 * 48) + (2 * 26) + (4 * 77) + (6 * 66) + (2 * 47) = 384 + 52 + 308 + 396 + 94 = 1234.\n\nSince 1234 > 1029, this offer could be worthwhile.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

The discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nDiscounted value = 521 * 0.9 = 468.9\n\nMy outside offer is 1029. Since 468.9 is significantly less than 1029, accepting this offer would be a bad choice.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to figure out what I can offer Player 1 to get a better deal for myself while still ensuring Player 1 also benefits more than their outside offer. I have the following amounts of each item:\n\n*   Item 1: 9 - 2 = 7 units\n*   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n*   Item 4: 7 - 3 = 4 units\n*   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n\nGiven the limited rounds and my strong outside option, I need to push for a deal closer to my ideal outcome. I'll aim for a division where I secure a significant portion of items 3 and 4, since those have the highest value for me (77 and 66 respectively).\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 the following: [5, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means I would receive:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 units\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 5 units\n*   Item 4: 7 units\n*   Item 5: 2 units\n\nValue to me = (4 * 48) + (1 * 26) + (5 * 77) + (7 * 66) + (2 * 47) = 192 + 26 + 385 + 462 + 94 = 1159\n\nDiscounted value = 1159 * 0.9 = 1043.1\n\nThis is slightly above my outside option.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and decide on the best action.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n* Item 1: 1 unit. Value = 1 * 1 = 1\n* Item 2: 1 unit. Value = 1 * 97 = 97\n* Item 3: 9 units. Value = 9 * 55 = 495\n* Item 4: 2 units. Value = 2 * 64 = 128\n* Item 5: 2 units. Value = 2 * 56 = 112\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 1 + 97 + 495 + 128 + 112 = 833\n\nSince my outside offer is 881, the current offer (833) is less than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting the current offer is not optimal.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. Since this is round 1, there are two more rounds left. I want to get more than 881 after the discount factor is applied.\n\nLet's think about a possible counteroffer. If I ask for almost everything, say I offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], that would give me:\n* Item 1: 3 units. Value = 3 * 1 = 3\n* Item 2: 6 units. Value = 6 * 97 = 582\n* Item 3: 10 units. Value = 10 * 55 = 550\n* Item 4: 5 units. Value = 5 * 64 = 320\n* Item 5: 9 units. Value = 9 * 56 = 504\n\nTotal Value = 3 + 582 + 550 + 320 + 504 = 1959.\n\nThis is the maximum I can get, but it's very unlikely Player 1 would accept this. So, I should make a more reasonable counteroffer, offering Player 1 enough to be better than their outside offer. Since I don't know what Player 1's values are, I will start by trying to get half the items, as that is better than the current offer.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]\nThis means I would get:\nItem 1: 2 * 1 = 2\nItem 2: 3 * 97 = 291\nItem 3: 5 * 55 = 275\nItem 4: 3 * 64 = 192\nItem 5: 5 * 56 = 280\nTotal = 2 + 291 + 275 + 192 + 280 = 1040\n\nSince 1040 is greater than my outside offer of 881, I'll make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]}\n```",

The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n* Item 1: 2 * 1 = 2\n* Item 2: 1 * 97 = 97\n* Item 3: 9 * 55 = 495\n* Item 4: 2 * 64 = 128\n* Item 5: 2 * 56 = 112\nTotal value of the current offer = 2 + 97 + 495 + 128 + 112 = 834\n\nSince it's round 2, we need to discount this value by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nDiscounted value of current offer = 834 * 0.9 = 750.6\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 881. Therefore, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To make a worthwhile counteroffer, I need to propose something that gives me a value *greater* than 881/0.9 = 978.89 (undiscounted). This is because Player 1's acceptance in round 2 needs to exceed my outside offer after discounting.\n\nLet's try to aim for a value around 980. We want to minimize what we give to Player 1 and maximize what we keep for ourselves. Here are the total quantities of each item: 3, 6, 10, 5, 9.\n\nLet's consider keeping everything for myself, so offering Player 1 nothing.  This would give me:\n3 * 1 + 6 * 97 + 10 * 55 + 5 * 64 + 9 * 56 = 3 + 582 + 550 + 320 + 504 = 1959\nThis is much greater than 980, so we can definitely offer something.\n\nLet's try giving Player 1 the minimum to get them to accept. My best items are item 2 and 5. Let's give them more of item 1, 3 and 4 and less of item 2 and 5.\n\nLet's offer Player 1 [1, 2, 6, 3, 5].

This leaves me with [2, 5, 5, 3, 5]\n* Item 1: 2 * 1 = 2\n* Item 2: 5 * 97 = 485\n* Item 3: 5 * 55 = 275\n* Item 4: 3 * 64 = 192\n* Item 5: 5 * 56 = 280\nTotal value = 2 + 485 + 275 + 192 + 280 = 1234.\n\nLet's try offering player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep everything with a value of 1959.\nThis means that in order to be accepted in Round 2 I need to leave Player 1 with an amount that gives them at least 881 / 0.9 = 978.89.\nGiving player 1 very little would be worthwhile for me to do, however, it does not take into account their preferences.\n\nThe current offer of [2, 1, 9, 2, 2] gives Player 1:\n2*Player1_value_item1 + 1*Player1_value_item2 + 9*Player1_value_item3 + 2*Player1_value_item4 + 2*Player1_value_item5\n\nSince I don't know Player 1's values, it is difficult to determine the exact optimal amount to give them. However, giving them more of item 3 will be a good idea.\n\nTo be safe and to make sure that I can get a better value than walking away with 881, I will try and find an offer that I value much higher.\nLet me offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current offer on the table. I am being offered:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 77\n- Item 2: 55\n- Item 3: 85\n- Item 4: 76\n- Item 5: 61\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(3 * 77) + (3 * 55) + (0 * 85) + (1 * 76) + (0 * 61) = 231 + 165 + 0 + 76 + 0 = 472\n\nThis value (472) is less than my outside offer of 651. Therefore, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, I need to consider if making a counteroffer is worthwhile.  Given that it is the first round, there is room to negotiate. The maximum I could get is:\n(7 * 77) + (4 * 55) + (2 * 85) + (4 * 76) + (2 * 61) = 539 + 220 + 170 + 304 + 122 = 1355\n\nMy outside offer is 651.  I should aim to get more than that in any negotiation. Since it's the first round and the discount factor is 0.9, I have some leeway to ask for more.\n\nI'll start by making a counteroffer that gives the other player roughly half of the items, adjusted slightly to favor my higher-value items.  I will offer the following to Player 1:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 (3 * 77 = 231)\n- 2 units of item 2 (2 * 55 = 110)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (1 * 85 = 85)\n- 2 units of item 4 (2 * 76 = 152)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (1 * 61 = 61)\n\nThe total value for me in this counteroffer is 231 + 110 + 85 + 152 + 61 = 639\n\nSince this is still below my outside offer of 651, I will increase my demand slightly to try to get closer to my outside offer.\nNew offer to player 1:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\nI keep:\n- 4 units of item 1 (4 * 77 = 308)\n- 3 units of item 2 (3 * 55 = 165)\n- 2 units of item 3 (2 * 85 = 170)\n- 3 units of item 4 (3 * 76 = 228)\n- 2 units of item 5 (2 * 61 = 122)\nTotal value for me: 308 + 165 + 170 + 228 + 122 = 993\nThis is much better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my counteroffer is to give Player 1: [3, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

My value is 993. As shown previously.\nI should offer the other player a deal that gives me a value near 651/0.9 = 723.33\n\nLet's try offering [4, 2, 1, 2, 1].

I could try to take everything, leaving nothing to the other player. In that case, my value would be 953 * 0.9 = 857.7.\n\nGiven the previous offers, perhaps I should try offering something close to what Player 1 previously offered me in Round 1 (i.e., [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]).\n\nIf I offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1, that means I keep [4, 3, 5, 2, 4].

Therefore, I will attempt to make a very modest counteroffer.\n\nThe total number of each item is 6, 4, 3, 6, 6 respectively. I currently have the following units:\n* Item 1: 6 - 3 = 3\n* Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n* Item 3: 3 - 2 = 1\n* Item 4: 6 - 1 = 5\n* Item 5: 6 - 2 = 4\nThe total possible value I can get is:\n* Item 1: 3 * 24 = 72\n* Item 2: 3 * 89 = 267\n* Item 3: 1 * 39 = 39\n* Item 4: 5 * 41 = 205\n* Item 5: 4 * 76 = 304\nTotal = 887\n\nI will make a counteroffer giving them 2, 1, 1, 1, 1:\n* Item 1: 4 * 24 = 96\n* Item 2: 3 * 89 = 267\n* Item 3: 2 * 39 = 78\n* Item 4: 5 * 41 = 205\n* Item 5: 5 * 76 = 380\nTotal = 1026\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n",

Evaluate the current offer:**\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n* 3 units of item 1: 3 * 24 = 72\n* 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 89 = 89\n* 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 39 = 39\n* 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 41 = 41\n* 2 units of item 5: 2 * 76 = 152\nTotal value of current offer: 72 + 89 + 39 + 41 + 152 = 393\n\n**2. Consider the discount factor:**\n\nWe are in round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  The discounted value of the current offer is 393 * 0.9 = 353.7.\n\n**3. Compare to the outside offer:**\n\nMy outside offer is 544. The discounted value of accepting the current offer (353.7) is less than my outside offer.\n\n**4. Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nSince this is round 2, making a counteroffer is still an option. I need to determine if I can construct a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept and that is worth more to me than my outside offer *after* the discount. My outside offer, discounted for this round is 544.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1 slightly more than their previous offer to see if we can come to an agreement, while ensuring I get value that is above my outside offer.\n\nPlayer 1's current offer is [3, 1, 1, 1, 2] so I'd have:\nItem 1: 3 units at 24 = 72\nItem 2: 1 unit at 89 = 89\nItem 3: 1 unit at 39 = 39\nItem 4: 1 unit at 41 = 41\nItem 5: 2 units at 76 = 152\nTotal: 393\n\nTherefore, player 1 is getting:\nItem 1: 3 units\nItem 2: 1 units\nItem 3: 1 units\nItem 4: 1 units\nItem 5: 2 units\nMy resources:\nItem 1: 6 units\nItem 2: 4 units\nItem 3: 3 units\nItem 4: 6 units\nItem 5: 6 units\n\nIf I offer [3, 1, 1, 1, 2] to player 1, I would have [3, 3, 2, 5, 4] to myself:\nItem 1: 3 units at 24 = 72\nItem 2: 3 unit at 89 = 267\nItem 3: 2 unit at 39 = 78\nItem 4: 5 unit at 41 = 205\nItem 5: 4 unit at 76 = 304\nTotal: 926\ndiscounted value : 833.4\n\nOffer [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nItem 1: 4 units at 24 = 96\nItem 2: 4 unit at 89 = 356\nItem 3: 3 unit at 39 = 117\nItem 4: 6 unit at 41 = 246\nItem 5: 6 unit at 76 = 456\nTotal: 1271\ndiscounted value : 1143.9\n\nI will make the counteroffer to give player 1 two of Item 1.\nThis would give me 4 * 24 + 4 * 89 + 3 * 39 + 6 * 41 + 6 * 76 = 1271 which when discounted is 1143.9.\n\n**5. Decision:**\n\nSince the discounted value of making the counteroffer is far higher than my outside option, this is the best course of action.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If I make a counteroffer and Player 2 walks away, I only get my outside offer of 553.

Since 554 is less than 727, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, keeping in mind the limited number of rounds and the discount factor. I have the following items to allocate:\n\n*   Item 1: 4 units\n*   Item 2: 2 units\n*   Item 3: 8 units\n*   Item 4: 4 units\n*   Item 5: 8 units\n\nA simple strategy would be to offer Player 1 slightly more than half the value of a perfectly fair split. A \"fair\" split would give them: 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 4 of item 5. It is not possible for me to deduce Player 1's private valuations for the different item types. As such, I will try to obtain as much item 5, the most valuable item to me, as possible.\nI should offer something that provides Player 1 with substantial value. Since the current offer is quite poor, I will try to create an offer that is attractive to Player 1 and better than my outside option.\n\nLet's consider offering Player 1:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 4 units\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 2 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 4 units\n*   Item 4: 2 units\n*   Item 5: 6 units\n\nThe value of this to me is:\n\n(2 * 32) + (1 * 54) + (4 * 32) + (2 * 57) + (6 * 91) = 64 + 54 + 128 + 114 + 546 = 906\n\nSince 906 > 727, this is better than walking away.\n\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 4, 2, 2]}\n```",

Let me be even more aggressive.\n\nFinal offer (what I give to Player 2):\n- Item 1: 1 unit (I keep 5)\n- Item 2: 0 units (I keep all 5)\n- Item 3: 0 units (I keep all 5) \n- Item 4: 0 units (I keep all 2)\n- Item 5: 1 unit (I keep 2)\n\nMy value: (5\u00d721) + (5\u00d785) + (5\u00d794) + (2\u00d765) + (2\u00d740) = 105 + 425 + 470 + 130 + 80 = 1210\n\nThis is still slightly below my outside offer, but it's close, and the counterparty might accept or give a reasonable counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [1, 0, 0, 0, 1], meaning I receive 1 unit of item 1 and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 48\n- Item 2: 11\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 92\n- Item 5: 3\n\nTherefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 48) + (0 * 11) + (0 * 2) + (0 * 92) + (1 * 3) = 48 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 51\n\nMy outside offer is 435. Since 51 < 435, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To make a good counteroffer, I need to offer Player 1 enough value to make them accept, while still retaining enough value for myself to exceed my outside offer (discounted by the round). Since this is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1. Thus my offer needs to exceed 435.\n\nI have a total of:\n- 6 units of item 1\n- 5 units of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nLet's aim to give player 1 the items they value less, and keep the items I value more. Item 4 is my most valuable, so I definitely want to keep those.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items to me:\n(6 * 48) + (5 * 11) + (5 * 2) + (2 * 92) + (3 * 3) = 288 + 55 + 10 + 184 + 9 = 546\n\nI need to find an offer that player 1 would likely accept, leaving me with a value greater than 435. A simple approach is to give player 1 half the items. However, without knowing player 1's values, it's risky.\n\nA more reasonable strategy is to aim for an offer that's slightly better than my outside offer. Let's try keeping the two item 4 and making an offer that aims to give player 1 about 100 in value in my eyes.\n\nSuppose I offer player 1: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5. Then I would be keeping 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 2 unit of item 4 and 0 unit of item 5 for a value of:\n(1 * 48) + (0 * 11) + (0 * 2) + (2 * 92) + (0 * 3) = 48 + 0 + 0 + 184 + 0 = 232\n\nThis is significantly less than 435.\n\nI will offer a little bit more than half of each item. Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. It seems they might value item 1 and 5 more than item 2,3,4.\nCounteroffer: [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]. This means I'll keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nMy value: (3 * 48) + (3 * 11) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 92) + (2 * 3) = 144 + 33 + 6 + 92 + 6 = 281. Still less than my outside offer.\n\nSince I only have a few options and my calculations show that even what looks to be a generous offer is less than my outside offer. I will WALK\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

I need to keep in mind that this is round 1, so there are two more rounds of negotiation possible. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nLet's see what the total value of all items is to me:\n*   2 units of item 1: 2 * 28 = 56\n*   6 units of item 2: 6 * 87 = 522\n*   2 units of item 3: 2 * 81 = 162\n*   4 units of item 4: 4 * 8 = 32\n*   3 units of item 5: 3 * 50 = 150\nTotal Value: 56 + 522 + 162 + 32 + 150 = 922\n\nSince my outside offer is 347, I want to make sure that the offer I make is higher than this amount.
