Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1389. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1389. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 7, 8, 5, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 6 + 24 x 7 + 57 x 8 + 69 x 5 + 21 x 6\n    which is 1383 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1389. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To approach this negotiation systematically, let's follow the outlined steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value**: 1389\n- **Values of the items for me**:\n  - Item 1: 48 per unit\n  - Item 2: 24 per unit\n  - Item 3: 57 per unit\n  - Item 4: 69 per unit\n  - Item 5: 21 per unit\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - Item 1: 6 units\n  - Item 2: 7 units\n  - Item 3: 9 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 7 units\n- **Impact of Discount Factor**: The discount factor \\(\\gamma = 0.9\\) means that value reduces with each subsequent round, so achieving a deal earlier provides higher overall value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer on the table**: None, since it is the first round.\n- **Potential counteroffers**:\n  - I need to propose an offer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer (1389). The goal is to maximize my retention of valuable items while ensuring the offer is attractive enough for acceptance.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nWe need to make an initial offer considering we must at least match our outside option (1389).\n\n#### Constructing a Counteroffer:\n\nAttempt to keep high-value items, especially those that contribute significantly to my total like item 3 and 4.\n\nLet's propose keeping the following:\n\n- Item 1: 5 out of 6\n- Item 2: 5 out of 7\n- Item 3: 6 out of 9\n- Item 4: 4 out of 5\n- Item 5: 5 out of 7\n\nCalculate my value for this division:\n\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 48 = 240\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 24 = 120\n- 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 57 = 342\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 69 = 276\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 21 = 105\n\nTotal value = 240 + 120 + 342 + 276 + 105 = 1083\n\nThis proposal is below the outside offer value of 1389. Let\u2019s iterate to find a better allocation. Now let's consider a more valuable arrangement to exceed 1389.\n\nAttempt to optimize higher: \n\n- Item 1: 6 out of 6 (giving away 0)\n- Item 2: 7 out of 7 (giving away 0)\n- Item 3: 6 out of 9 (giving away 3)\n- Item 4: 5 out of 5 (giving away 0)\n- Item 5: 2 out of 7 (giving away 5)\n\nCalculate my value for this configuration:\n\n- 6 \u00d7 48 = 288 (Item 1)\n- 7 \u00d7 24 = 168 (Item 2)\n- 6 \u00d7 57 = 342 (Item 3)\n- 5 \u00d7 69 = 345 (Item 4)\n- 2 \u00d7 21 = 42 (Item 5)\n\nTotal value = 288 + 168 + 342 + 345 + 42 = 1185\n\nWhile this is a better split for me, adjusting once more because it should be greater than 1389:\n\nRetain the high values further:\n\n- Item 1: 6 out of 6 (0 for Player 2)\n- Item 2: 7 out of 7 (0 for Player 2)\n- Item 3: 7 out of 9 (2 for Player 2)\n- Item 4: 5 out of 5 (0 for Player 2)\n- Item 5: 4 out of 7 (3 for Player 2)\n\nCheck the value:\n\n- 6 \u00d7 48 = 288\n- 7 \u00d7 24 = 168\n- 7 \u00d7 57 = 399\n- 5 \u00d7 69 = 345\n- 4 \u00d7 21 = 84\n\nTotal value = 288 + 168 + 399 + 345 + 84 = 1284. Insignificant move.\n\nLooking for another meaningful offer:\n\nTry:\n\n- Item 1: 6 out of 6 (giving away 0)\n- Item 2: 7 out of 7 (giving away 0)\n- Item 3: 8 out of 9 (offering 1)\n- Item 4: 5 out of 5 (0 for Player 2)\n- Item 5: 3 out of 7 (offering 4)\n\nCalculate the value:\n\n- 6 \u00d7 48 = 288\n- 7 \u00d7 24 = 168\n- 8 \u00d7 57 = 456\n- 5 \u00d7 69 = 345\n- 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n\nTotal value: 288 + 168 + 456 + 345 + 63 = 1320\n\nClose enough, offer still below my outside offer (which indicates RETRY or alter but this provides a substantial benchmark with less game overlap).\n\nGiven these values, re-evaluate what stretches past 1410 retention possibilities?\n\nLet\u2019s CONDUCT offering first counter with concessions as:\n\nMy proposal should be:\n- Item 1: 5 (giving 1)\n- Item 2: 6 (giving 1)\n- Item 3: 6 (giving 3)\n- Item 4: 4 (giving 1)\n- Item 5: 3 (giving 4)\n\nVerify compromise VALUATION:\n- 5 \u00d7 48 = 240 (item 1)\n- 6 \u00d7 24 = 144 (item 2)\n- 6 \u00d7 57 = 342 (item 3)\n- 4 \u00d7 69 = 276 (item 4)\n- 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (item 5)\n\nTotal: 240 + 144 + 342 + 276 + 63 = 1065 Below outside offer, hence practical, obstacle.\n\nIf zero deviation offers are rejected OR they RETAIN multi offer consistency: re-evaluate again for further adjustment upon rule-play.\n\nAttempt with more modest variation showcase:\n\n- Item 1: 4 (giving 2)\n- Item 2: 5 (giving 2)\n- Item 3: 5 (giving 4)\n- Item 4: 4 (giving 1)\n- Item 5: 2 (giving 5)\n\n- 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n- 5 \u00d7 24 = 120\n- 5 \u00d7 57 = 285\n- 4 \u00d7 69 = 276\n- 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n\nIf revised award = 915 Rather than explicit COUNTEROFFER value.\n\n### **Final Stated Offer Action:**\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 4, 2, 5]} \n\nContinue reajusting back-and-forth necessity according or accept majority if inconclusive yet cooperative dividends on adjustment basis which remains beneficial provided schema.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 324. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 0 + 96 x 1 + 54 x 2 + 39 x 3 + 72 x 0\n    which is 321 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 324. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means the value of an accepted offer decreases with each passing round due to the factor of \u03b3^(r-1). In round 1, this factor is 1 (as it's the first round).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I am making the initial proposal.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  I need to propose an offer that fetches me more than my outside offer of 324. Let's evaluate some scenarios:\n\n  - **Scenario 1:** \n    - I offer [0, 1, 3, 1, 0] to Player 2, and I keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n    - **My value calculation:** \n      - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n      - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n      - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n      - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n      - Total value = 478\n\n  This total is significantly above my outside offer of 324.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?** There is no current offer on the table.\n  \n- **Should I Walk Away?** Not at this moment, since I can propose a counteroffer more valuable than my outside offer.\n  \n- **Propose a Specific Counteroffer:** Based on scenario 1, I decide to propose an initial offer which maximizes my value above my outside offer.\n\nGiven these considerations, my action will be to make a counteroffer that ensures my value from items remains above the outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 1, 0]}\n```\n\nThis proposal balances keeping valuable items based on my private values while making a reasonable offer to Player 2, ensuring that the retained value exceeds my fallback outside offer.",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 190. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 190. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 423 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 1 + 65 x 1 + 26 x 1 + 4 x 0 + 17 x 4\n    which is 188 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 190. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I'll continue to explore:\n\n- Propose keeping:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 (29 \u00d7 1 = 29)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (65 \u00d7 1 = 65)\n  - 1 unit of item 3 (26 \u00d7 1 = 26)\n  - 6 units of item 4 (4 \u00d7 6 = 24)\n  - 1 unit of item 5 (17 \u00d7 1 = 17)\n\nNew total value: \\(29 + 65 + 26 + 24 + 17 = 161\\)\n\nThis is still not acceptable for me since it does not reach 190.\n\nAttempt to maximize item 5, as these carry higher weights:\n\n- Propose keeping:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 (29 \u00d7 1 = 29)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (65 \u00d7 1 = 65)\n  - 1 unit of item 3 (26 \u00d7 1 = 26)\n  - 2 units of item 4 (4 \u00d7 2 = 8)\n  - 4 units of item 5 (17 \u00d7 4 = 68)\n\nThis results in a total value of \\(29 + 65 + 26 + 8 + 68 = 196\\)\n\n196 is better than my outside offer of 190.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on my analysis, proposing a counteroffer where I keep [1, 1, 1, 2, 4] units of the respective items would yield a value of 196, which is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]}\n```\n\nThis offer means I'm giving Player 2, 4 units of item 4 while keeping the rest for myself as planned above.",

Being in round 2, if we reach the end of this round, a counteroffer or acceptance will be valued at gamma^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer on the table**: [1, 0, 0, 3, 2]\n  - Calculate the value to you:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n    - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n    - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 17 = 34\n    - Total value: 29 + 12 + 34 = 75\n  - After applying the discount factor: 75 \u00d7 0.9 = 67.5\n\nSince 67.5 is less than your outside offer of 190, it is not beneficial for you to accept the current offer.\n\n- **Evaluate potential counteroffers**:\n  The goal is to create an offer more advantageous than your outside offer value of 190.\n\n  Example counteroffer that may benefit you: \n  - Keeping more high-value items (e.g., Item 2 and 5), consider offering Player 2 the minimum that still yields you more than 190:\n  - Potential counteroffer: [0, 0, 1, 4, 1], keeping [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]\n  \n  Calculate the value:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n  - Total value: 29 + 65 + 8 + 51 = 153\n\nWith the discount factor for round 2, the adjusted value is:\n  - 153 \u00d7 0.9 = 137.7, which is still less than 190.\n\nIterate to improve the offer:\n  - Let's keep [1, 1, 1, 2, 3], offering [0, 0, 0, 4, 1] to Player 2.\n  - This provides:\n    - Item 1: 29\n    - Item 2: 65\n    - Item 3: 26\n    - Item 4: 8\n    - Item 5: 51\n    - Total value: 179\n    \nWith the discount factor:\n  - 179 \u00d7 0.9 = 161.1, which is still less than 190.\n\nI will continue this process until I meet or exceed 190 after discounting.\n\nBy proposing to keep [1, 1, 1, 3, 3], offering [0, 0, 0, 3, 1] to Player 2, you get:\n  - Item 1: 29\n  - Item 2: 65\n  - Item 3: 26\n  - Item 4: 12\n  - Item 5: 51\n  - Total value: 183\n  \nWith the discount factor:\n  - 183 \u00d7 0.9 = 164.7, still less than 190 after discounting.\n\nA valid counteroffer cannot be found, suggesting the optimum strategy is to WALK.\n\n### Decision\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the current offer from Player 2 and any feasible counteroffers provide less value than your outside offer after considering the discount factor. Therefore, the optimal action is to walk away and take the outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 382. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 630 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 69 x 4 + 88 x 1 + 40 x 0 + 2 x 1\n    which is 377 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 382. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This factor means that if we prolong the negotiations, the effective value I receive decreases each round. It's round 1, so the discount factor currently doesn\u2019t decrease my payoff.\n\n2) **Assess the value of potential offers**:\n   - **No current offer to accept**: Given that there is no current offer, accepting is not an option in this step.\n   - **Evaluate counteroffers**: I need to make an initial offer that assures me a value greater than my outside offer (382). Let\u2019s explore what happens if we propose keeping more valuable items, primarily focusing on item 3 (highest value item to me) and item 2 (second in priority).\n\n3) **Propose a specific counteroffer**:\n   - **Potential offer to Player 2**: Let's consider offering [0, 4, 2, 0, 0], meaning I give Player 2 0 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n   \n   - **My retained units and value calculation**:\n     - I keep 1 item 1: 11 \u00d7 1 = 11\n     - I keep 2 item 2: 69 \u00d7 2 = 138\n     - I keep 3 item 3: 88 \u00d7 3 = 264\n     - I keep 1 item 4: 40 \u00d7 1 = 40\n     - I keep 1 item 5: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n\n     - Total retained value = 11 + 138 + 264 + 40 + 2 = 455\n\nThis offer yields me a value of 455, which is comfortably above my outside offer of 382.

                    "response": "To determine the proper action, let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 382.\n\n2. **Values of the Items**:\n   - Item 1: 11\n   - Item 2: 69\n   - Item 3: 88\n   - Item 4: 40\n   - Item 5: 2\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items**: \n   - 1 unit of item 1\n   - 6 units of item 2\n   - 5 units of item 3\n   - 1 unit of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n\n4. **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This means the value of the outcome is multiplied by gamma^(r-1). If I accept in this round (r = 2), my values will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**: [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] is being offered to me.\n   - My value: 0\u00d711 + 2\u00d769 + 1\u00d788 + 0\u00d740 + 0\u00d72 = 226\n   - Adjusted by discount factor (0.9): 226 \u00d7 0.9 = 203.4\n\n2. **Comparison with My Outside Offer**: \n   - Current offer value (adjusted): 203.4\n   - Outside offer value: 382\n\nSince 203.4 is less than 382, accepting the current offer is not preferable to my outside offer.\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffers**:\n   - I need to make sure any counteroffer gives me a value greater than 382 when adjusted by the discount factor.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that the current offer value (203.4) is less than my outside offer value (382), I should not accept it. My goal is to maximize my value.\n\nLet's create a counteroffer such that my value is higher than my outside offer value.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffer Calculation\n\nThe goal is to achieve a total value greater than 382. Let's test the offer where I keep [1, 4, 3, 1, 1] and offer the rest to Player 2:\n- I keep:\n  - Item 1: 1\u00d711 = 11\n  - Item 2: 4\u00d769 = 276\n  - Item 3: 3\u00d788 = 264\n  - Item 4: 1\u00d740 = 40\n  - Item 5: 1\u00d72 = 2\n- Total value to me: 11 + 276 + 264 + 40 + 2 = 593\n- Adjusted by discount factor: 593 \u00d7 0.9 = 533.7\n\nSince 533.7 is significantly greater than 382, this offer is advantageous. Therefore, I will propose this division. \n\n### Decision\n\nI propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]}\n```\n\nThis counteroffer means I offer Player 2 two units of each item that is not a singular unit, maximizing my share based on my values and exceeding the outside offer when adjusted for the discount factor.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 887. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 1, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 3 + 2 x 0 + 85 x 1 + 68 x 4 + 87 x 5\n    which is 885 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 887. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 887. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 887. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 1, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 3 + 2 x 0 + 85 x 1 + 68 x 4 + 87 x 5\n    which is 885 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 887. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on my action, I need to analyze the situation and perform calculations to determine the best outcome for me.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 887.\n  \n- **Values of the Items**: \n  - Item 1: 31 per unit\n  - Item 2: 2 per unit\n  - Item 3: 85 per unit\n  - Item 4: 68 per unit\n  - Item 5: 87 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: The negotiation is in round 2, so the discount factor (gamma = 0.9) has a relatively slight impact (0.9^1 = 0.9). However, the value of any agreement this round will be slightly reduced compared to the same outcome in round 1 due to discounting.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer Value (if I accept)**:\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 85 = 85\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n  - Total value = 93 + 0 + 85 + 136 + 87 = 401\n  - Discounted value = 401 \u00d7 0.9 = 360.9\n\n  Since 360.9 is significantly less than my outside offer of 887, accepting the current offer is not favorable.\n\n- **Value of Potential Counteroffers**: I will calculate a potential division to ensure my value received is more than my outside offer of 887.\n\nLet's propose that I keep [5, 1, 0, 3, 5] items:\n  - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 31 = 155\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 85 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n  - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 87 = 435\n  - Total value before discount = 155 + 2 + 0 + 204 + 435 = 796\n  - Discounted value = 796 \u00d7 0.9 = 716.4\n\nSince 716.4 is still less than my outside offer of 887, this is not a good counteroffer.\n\nIt is clear from these calculations that improving on the outside offer is challenging under the given constraints. Proposing that extreme alternative won\u2019t work either. Unless a significant change in items allocation occurs, or more aggressive rounds are risked (with discounting effects), I might be unable to improve beyond the direct fallback.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on Analysis:\n\nGiven all the analysis, walking away is currently better because neither the current offer nor any feasible counteroffer exceeds my outside offer value of 887.\n\n**Decision**: \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Therefore, I need to adjust it to ensure the value exceeds my outside offer.\n\nLet's increase the units I keep, making the offer more favorable, yet aiming to leave some value for Player 2.\n\n- Adjust the offer:\n  - Item 1: 6 (offer 3 to Player 2)\n  - Item 2: 0 (offer 2 to Player 2)\n  - Item 3: 3 (offer 2 to Player 2)\n  - Item 4: 2 (offer 1 to Player 2)\n  - Item 5: 3 (offer 0 to Player 2)\n\nCalculate new value:\n\\[\n6 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 43 + 3 \\times 67 + 2 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 23 = 12 + 201 + 44 + 69 = 326\n\\]\n\nThis offer is still below my outside offer.

I need to maximize item 3 due to its high value to me.\n\nAssume I decide to try:\n- Item 1: 9 (offer 0 to Player 2)\n- Item 2: 1 (offer 1 to Player 2)\n- Item 3: 3 (offer 2 to Player 2)\n- Item 4: 3 (offer 0 to Player 2)\n- Item 5: 1 (offer 2 to Player 2)\n\nCalculate the value:\n\\[\n9 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 43 + 3 \\times 67 + 3 \\times 22 + 1 \\times 23 = 18 + 43 + 201 + 66 + 23 = 351\n\\]\n\nContinue to iterate for a proposed offer close to threshold 394 and adjust:\n\n- My goal: \n  - Item 1: 5\n  - Item 2: 0\n  - Item 3: 3\n  - Item 4: 2\n  - Item 5: 2\n\nCompute this again:\n\\[ \n5 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 43 + 3 \\times 67 + 2 \\times 22 + 2 \\times 23 = 10 + 0 + 201 + 44 + 46 = 301 \n\\]\n\nFacing diminishing returns on these initial steps, I should deploy the paradigm of Max Item 3 to push value.\n\nAnother guess format in lowering/distributing edges: \nAdjust to exceed:\n\n- 4 of item 3 raise in returning value each step.\n- Set tightly on exact scale balances to resolve smallest gap offers.\n\nWith improving results:\nIf finally achieved:\n\\[ \\text{Push to than benefits or rely on outsource.} \\]\n\nTherefore, after iterations and approaches considering improvement penalties, I refine to realign:\nItems expected - test ranges:\n  - Item 1: 6 or 4\n  - Item 2: consist push 1 \n  - Item 3: max web form trials, value anchoring \n  - Item 4: 2 remain again \n  - Item 5: Tighten closing (or while allowing trade on last of).\n\nReflect reducing value miscues, attempting again below supply as absolute Offers recalculated again via based understanding.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 343. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 343. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 702 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 12 x 0 + 61 x 4 + 58 x 1 + 39 x 1\n    which is 341 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 343. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 12 x 0 + 61 x 4 + 58 x 1 + 39 x 1\n    which is 341 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 343. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 5, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 4 + 14 x 1 + 21 x 5 + 65 x 3 + 83 x 5\n    which is 997 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 998. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's break down the current situation and assess the best action in this negotiation game step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n1. **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 998.\n   \n2. **Values of Items:** My values per unit for each item are:\n   - Item 1: 67\n   - Item 2: 14\n   - Item 3: 21\n   - Item 4: 65\n   - Item 5: 83\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - Item 1: 4 units\n   - Item 2: 4 units\n   - Item 3: 7 units\n   - Item 4: 4 units\n   - Item 5: 5 units\n\n4. **Discount Factor:** The discount rate is 0.9, so at round 2, the value is multiplied by 0.9 to the power of (2-1) = 0.9. This affects the value we gain in this round by reducing it to 90% of its face value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer on the Table:** Player 2 is offering me [2, 2, 2, 2, 4].\n   - Value to me for current offer:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 67 = 134\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n     - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 83 = 332\n   - Total value of current offer = 134 + 28 + 42 + 130 + 332 = 666\n   - Adjusted for discount (0.9): 666 \u00d7 0.9 = 599.4\n\n   The current offer, even with the adjusted discount value, is only 599.4, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 998.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to propose offers that will provide me greater than my outside offer value of 998.\n\n   Let's calculate a potential counteroffer that would be more favorable for me. Suppose I propose to keep [3, 0, 5, 1, 3]:\n   - Value:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 201\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n     - 5 units of item 3 = 105\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 65\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 249\n   - Total value = 201 + 0 + 105 + 65 + 249 = 620\n\n   This offer would still be worse than my outside offer after adjusting for the discount: 620 \u00d7 0.9 = 558.\n\n   Attempting to retain more item units, I should find a combination that maximizes my value past my outside offer even after the discount. Trying to keep [4, 1, 5, 3, 5]:\n   - Value:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 268\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 14\n     - 5 units of item 3 = 105\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 195\n     - 5 units of item 5 = 415\n   - Total = 268 + 14 + 105 + 195 + 415 = 997. \n\n   Even this high allocation isn\u2019t enough with discount: 997 \u00d7 0.9 = 897.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nGiven the above calculations, any feasible division of items still results in lower value than my guaranteed outside offer after adjusting for the discounting. Because I cannot make a counteroffer that surpasses my outside offer within this framework:\n- I should choose to WALK away as this provides the best option for me in round 2 as attempting counteroffers don't reach my threshold outside offer of 998.\n\n**Action Decision:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 6, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 4 + 9 x 1 + 51 x 6 + 10 x 3 + 14 x 0\n    which is 613 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 614. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 1, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

As rounds progress, acceptance values decrease due to the discount rate of 0.9 per round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current offer on the table**: None (therefore no calculation necessary).\n- **Possible counteroffer**:\n  - I will evaluate keeping all items first to see the maximum I could achieve:\n    - Value from keeping all:\n      - 2 units of item 1: \\( 2 \\times 37 = 74 \\)\n      - 3 units of item 2: \\( 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\)\n      - 6 units of item 3: \\( 6 \\times 88 = 528 \\)\n      - 1 unit of item 4: \\( 1 \\times 88 = 88 \\)\n      - 2 units of item 5: \\( 2 \\times 36 = 72 \\)\n    - Total value = \\( 74 + 24 + 528 + 88 + 72 = 786 \\)\n  - Since resigning from the negotiation grants me only 2, any allocation of items that accumulates to more than 2 is advantageous.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\nTo avoid any of the aforementioned mistakes:\n- Mistake 1 & 2: My counteroffers must ensure my value exceeds 2.\n- Mistake 3: Making offers that are not extreme and divisible boundaries.\n- Mistake 4: No offer accepted would be worse than 2 without calculation confirming it.\n- Mistake 5: Walking is reserved for scenarios with offers < 2.\n\n#### Counteroffer Calculation:\nTo experiment and to have some initial bargaining room, let's consider keeping a solid portion of items to exceed an outside offer of 2:\n\n- **Proposal**: Keep high-value items but offer low-value ones sufficiently to open negotiations for Player 2\n  - Counteroffer proposal to give Player 2:\n    - 0 units of item 1\n    - 2 units of item 2\n    - 2 units of item 3\n    - 0 units of item 4\n    - 1 unit of item 5\n  \n- **Calculate value of counteroffer for me**:\n  - Keeping 2 of item 1: \\( 2 \\times 37 = 74 \\)\n  - Keeping 1 of item 2: \\( 1 \\times 8 = 8 \\)\n  - Keeping 4 of item 3: \\( 4 \\times 88 = 352 \\)\n  - Keeping 1 of item 4: \\( 1 \\times 88 = 88 \\)\n  - Keeping 1 of item 5: \\( 1 \\times 36 = 36 \\)\n\n- **Total value for me**:\n  - Total value = \\( 74 + 8 + 352 + 88 + 36 = 558 \\)\n  - This is significantly greater than my outside offer of 2.\n\nBased on this analysis and counteroffer simulation, the advantageous move is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 36 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 2. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, we need to make an initial offer that ensures our retained value is higher than our outside offer (319).\n\n**Proposed Divisions**: \nLet's consider different scenarios and calculate values:\n\n1. Offering Player 2: [2, 1, 6, 2, 1]\n   - Keeping: [2, 1, 0, 3, 2]\n   - My value: 2(35) + 1(92) + 0(11) + 3(59) + 2(60) = 70 + 92 + 0 + 177 + 120 = 459\n\nSince the value (459) is higher than my outside offer (319), this offer is a good starting point. \n\nBefore making more iterations, let's check if this satisfies basic conditions to balance a reasonable proposition to Player 2. This proposal allows me to surpass the fallback value and positions within the negotiation to leverage future rounds if needed.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on our calculations, the suggested offer allows me to retain a total value of 459, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 319. This satisfies the need to avoid Mistakes 2 and 4 from the mentioned list of possible errors. \n\nThe initial offer should also consider leaving a fair portion of items for Player 2 to encourage negotiation, aiming to avoid Mistakes 3 and 5.\n\nSo, my action is to make a counteroffer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 6, 2, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 11 x 2 + 59 x 4 + 60 x 1\n    which is 318 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 319. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 6, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, it's preferable to settle on a favorable offer earlier rather than later.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer\n- There is no current offer on the table.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers\n- I need to come up with an offer that gives me a total value greater than 789 (my outside offer value).\n- Let's calculate the value of keeping different quantities of items. \n\nSuppose I make a counteroffer to keep: \n- 5 units of item 1,\n- 6 units of item 2,\n- 5 units of item 3,\n- 0 units of item 4 (since none are available),\n- 4 units of item 5.\n\nCalculate the total value for this scenario:\n- Value from item 1: 5 units \u00d7 14 = 70\n- Value from item 2: 6 units \u00d7 91 = 546\n- Value from item 3: 5 units \u00d7 25 = 125\n- Value from item 5: 4 units \u00d7 59 = 236\n\nTotal value = 70 + 546 + 125 + 236 = 977\n\nThis gives me the highest possible value without sharing any items. It is significantly greater than my outside offer, but it would be rejected instantly by Player 2. \n\nI need to offer something more reasonable to Player 2 while maintaining a value greater than my outside offer. Therefore, let's propose:\n\n- 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to keep, and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\nCalculated Total Value:\n- Value from item 1: 3 units \u00d7 14 = 42\n- Value from item 2: 3 units \u00d7 91 = 273\n- Value from item 3: 3 units \u00d7 25 = 75\n- Value from item 5: 2 units \u00d7 59 = 118\n\nTotal value = 42 + 273 + 75 + 118 = 508\n\nThis is less than my outside offer. Let's adjust:\n\nLet's propose for me to keep:\n- 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n- This leaves: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 for Player 2.\n\nWhen calculating, my total value will be:\n- Value from item 1: 5 \u00d7 14 = 70\n- Value from item 2: 5 \u00d7 91 = 455\n- Value from item 3: 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n- Value from item 5: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n\nTotal value = 70 + 455 + 75 + 177 = 777\n\nIt is still less than my original outside offer of 789, but much closer.\n\nTry a smaller increment:\n\nLet's propose for me to keep: \n- 5 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 5 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5.\n- Giving the remainder: 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2.\n\nNow, the calculated value would be:\n- Value from item 1: 5 \u00d7 14 = 70 \n- Value from item 2: 3 \u00d7 91 = 273\n- Value from item 3: 5 \u00d7 25 = 125\n- Value from item 5: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 \n\nTotal Value = 70 + 273 + 125 + 177 = 645\n\nStill below my outside offer. Therefore, revise and propose:\n\n#### Counteroffer\n- 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5, and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\nWhen calculated, it might not still achieve value > outside offer but closer:\n- Value from item 1: 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n- Value from item 2: 5 \u00d7 91 = 455\n- Value from item 3: 4 \u00d7 25 = 100\n- Value from item 5: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 \n\nTotal value = 56 + 455 + 100 + 177 = 788\n\nIt comes very close to 789...\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\nGiven the value calculations, my best option is to make the following counteroffer as it is close enough, compared to keeping just 5 of everything and give 0 or all, but reasonable to make Player 2 consider accepting:\n\n- **Counteroffer**: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] to Player 2\n\nThis allows me to get close to maximizing value in my position, while also staying aligned with my objectives of making claims.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 4, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 4 + 91 x 5 + 25 x 4 + 35 x 0 + 59 x 3\n    which is 788 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 789. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [4, 1, 4, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 1, 4, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 2, if this round concludes with an agreement, the value is not discounted further at this stage.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer on the Table\nThe current offer on the table from Player 2 is [4, 1, 4, 0, 1].\nThis means Player 2 is offering me:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 5 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 0 unit of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nCalculating the value of the current offer to me:\n- Value from 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n- Value from 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 91 = 455\n- Value from 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n- Value from 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n- Value from 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n\nTotal value of the current offer = 14 + 455 + 25 + 0 + 177 = 671\n\n#### Comparison with Outside Offer\n- Current offer value: 671\n- My outside offer value: 789\n\nThe value of the current offer (671) is less than my outside offer (789).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nSince the current offer (671) is lower than my outside offer (789), accepting it would be a mistake according to Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for me than my outside offer.\n\nInstead, I can either propose a counteroffer that would yield a higher value or walk away.\n\n#### Counteroffer Calculation\nTo exceed my outside offer of 789, I need to formulate an offer where what I keep gives me a value greater than 789. For example:\n\n- Suppose I propose keeping 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5:\n  - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 14 = 56\n  - 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 91 = 455\n  - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 25 = 100\n  - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n  - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n\n  Total value for me = 56 + 455 + 100 + 0 + 177 = 788\n\nSince 788 is still less than my outside offer (789), this is not yet a viable counteroffer. I need to continue adjusting to find a counteroffer that makes my value exceed 789.\n\nAfter iterating, a viable counteroffer could be:\n- I propose keeping 5 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3,  0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 while offering [0, 0, 3, 0, 2] to Player 2:\n  - Value for me:\n    - 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 14 = 70\n    - 6 units of item 2: 6 \u00d7 91 = 546\n    - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n    - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n    - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n\n  Total value for me = 70 + 546 + 50 + 0 + 118 = 784\n\nSince 784 is still less than my outside offer (789), I can't find a better option than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, given the constraints, the best action is to walk away and choose my outside offer, as it guarantees a higher value.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 27 x 3 + 91 x 2 + 32 x 3 + 79 x 3\n    which is 596 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 597. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's walk through the step-by-step process outlined above.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 597.\n   - My values for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 7 per unit\n     - Item 2: 27 per unit\n     - Item 3: 91 per unit\n     - Item 4: 32 per unit\n     - Item 5: 79 per unit\n\n   - Total pool of items available:\n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 6 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 10 units of item 5\n\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) reduces value in future rounds, incentivizing reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - Current offer: None at this moment, so I need to consider possible offers.\n\n   - I need to propose a division where the total value I receive is greater than my outside offer value of 597.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   To propose a counteroffer that ensures a value greater than 597, I need to keep a sufficient number of high-value items.\n\n   One strategy could be:\n   - Keep: 6 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 5 units of item 5 for myself.\n   - Offer: 6 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n\n   Calculate the total value to me:\n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n   - 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 27 = 162\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n   - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 79 = 395\n\n   Total value to me = 0 + 162 + 182 + 32 + 395 = 771\n\n   Since 771 is greater than my outside offer of 597, this counteroffer is beneficial compared to walking away.\n\nThus, I will propose this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [6, 0, 0, 2, 5]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 12 x 1 + 35 x 5 + 25 x 6 + 3 x 4\n    which is 349 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 350. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is valued at 350.\n   - **Values of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 47 per unit\n     - Item 2: 12 per unit\n     - Item 3: 35 per unit\n     - Item 4: 25 per unit\n     - Item 5: 3 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 7 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** Since we are in round 1, the discount factor does not apply yet. However, if the negotiation goes to round 2, the value will be multiplied by 0.9, and by 0.81 in round 3. Therefore, it's preferable to conclude negotiations earlier to avoid diminishing returns.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** There is no current offer from Player 2 on the table.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to create a counteroffer where my portion is worth more than my outside offer of 350.\n\nLet's consider some potential offers where I retain high value items.\n\n- **Offer 1: [1, 5, 1, 1, 0]** (what I give to Player 2)\n  - My allocation would be: \n    - Item 1: 4 units (4 x 47 = 188)\n    - Item 2: 2 units (2 x 12 = 24)\n    - Item 3: 4 units (4 x 35 = 140)\n    - Item 4: 5 units (5 x 25 = 125)\n    - Item 5: 4 units (4 x 3 = 12)\n  - Total value to me = 489\n\nThe above offer leaves me with a total value of 489, which is higher than my outside offer. Therefore, it's a reasonable starting point to ensure my value exceeds the outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Since the calculated value (489) is greater than my outside offer (350), this offer aligns well with my objective of maximizing my value in the negotiation.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following offer to Player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

I need to either WALK away since the current offer is worse than my fallback option, or make a COUNTEROFFER.\n\nTo prepare a counteroffer, I'll find a division where my value is greater than 350. Here's a possible counteroffer:\n- Keep [2, 3, 2, 0, 0] for myself and offer [3, 4, 3, 6, 4] to Player 2.\n    - This gives me:\n      - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n      - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n      - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n      - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 25 = 0\n      - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n\n- **New total value if I keep [2, 3, 2, 0, 0]:** 94 + 36 + 70 + 0 + 0 = 200\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 350. Let's adjust the counteroffer:\n\n- Keep [3, 0, 3, 1, 4] for myself and offer [2, 7, 2, 5, 0] to Player 2.\n    - This gives me:\n      - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n      - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 12 = 0\n      - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105\n      - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n      - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\n- **New total value if I keep [3, 0, 3, 1, 4]:** 141 + 0 + 105 + 25 + 12 = 283\n\nThis value (283) would still be lower than my outside offer, so I should iterate once more:\n\nA more conservative offer could be:\n- Keep [5, 0, 4, 0, 4] for myself and offer [0, 7, 1, 6, 0] to Player 2.\n    - This gives me:\n      - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n      - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 12 = 0\n      - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 35 = 140\n      - 0 unit of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 25 = 0\n      - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\n- **New total value if I keep [5, 0, 4, 0, 4]:** 235 + 0 + 140 + 0 + 12 = 387\n\nThis value (387) is now above my outside offer value.

They've given me all of item 2 (which is moderately valuable to me at 37 per unit). However, I'm not getting any of item 1, which is my most valuable item at 54 per unit.\n\nSince this is round 2, I have one more opportunity to make a counteroffer. Let me try to improve my position by asking for some of item 1 while giving up more of items 4 and 5 (which are low value to me).\n\nI'll propose:\n- I get 3 units of item 1 (keeping 2 for Player 1)\n- I get 6 units of item 2 (giving 1 to Player 1)\n- I get 2 units of item 3 (giving 3 to Player 1)\n- I give all 6 units of item 4 to Player 1\n- I give all 4 units of item 5 to Player 1\n\nMy counteroffer to Player 1 would be [2, 1, 3, 6, 4]\n\nLet me check: if they were to accept this, my value would be:\n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 54 = 162\n- Item 2: 6 units \u00d7 37 = 222\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 50 = 100\n- Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 3 = 0\n- Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 7 = 0\nTotal = 484, which with discount factor in round 3 would be 484 \u00d7 0.81 = 392.04\n\nThat's better than the current offer's value of 294.3, so I'll make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 6, 4]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 12 x 1 + 35 x 5 + 25 x 6 + 3 x 4\n    which is 349 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 350. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If negotiations go to the next round, the value of any proposed division will decrease due to this factor.\n\n### Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n1. **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table as this is the first round, so I need to make an initial offer.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffers**: \n   - The goal is to propose a division that is worth more to me than my outside offer of 920. \n   - Example of an offer to consider: I will try to keep the combination of items that maximizes my value while ensuring Player 2 also receives a reasonable share.

I could potentially provide all units of Item 2 and Item 5 to Player 2, expecting these have less significance for me in the total, ensuring it doesn\u2019t severely impact Player 2.\n\n### Decision:\n\nBased on these calculations and reasoning, I should make an initial offer as a COUNTEROFFER to Player 2 as follows:\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 5, 0, 1, 4]\n\nThis leaves me with more valuable units based on my evaluation, and the proposed offer ensures I keep more than my outside offer's worth:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 0, 1, 4]}\n```\nThis division seems optimal given the information we have, aiming to secure maximum value while staying above the outside offer threshold.",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 920. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1125 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 71 x 5 + 81 x 4 + 60 x 4\n    which is 919 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 920. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 5, 0, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [7, 1, 2, 4, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [7, 1, 2, 4, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Additionally, I want to ensure that after discounting, the value of my counteroffer exceeds what I'm currently getting from Player 2's offer.\n\n   Let's calculate a counteroffer:\n   - Keep 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 unit of item 5:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 100 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 63 = 0\n     - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 71 = 284\n     - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 81 = 324\n     - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n     - Total value = 848\n     - Effective value after discount = 848 \u00d7 0.9 = 763.2\n     (This value is not acceptable because it\u2019s less than my outside offer and the discounted value of the current offer.)\n\n   To find better alternatives, I should adjust item acquisition to maximize value while ensuring it remains above the outside offer value.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 1160.1 after discount, which is clearly superior to my outside offer of 920. Rejecting this would be a mistake as it fits Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.\n   - Given the analysis, I should accept this offer because it maximizes my value with the current information I have.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

It reduces the value of future rounds. If the negotiation concludes in a later round, the present value of the items is multiplied by gamma to the power of (r-1), where r is the round number.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers.\n\n- **Current offer:** There is currently no offer on the table.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:** I must make an initial offer to Player 2. My counteroffer should ensure that I retain items worth more than my outside offer value of 919.\n\nLet's first calculate the maximum value I can get if I keep all items:  \n- Total value = (9 x 10) + (6 x 94) + (5 x 34) + (2 x 54) + (7 x 73)  \n- Total value = 90 + 564 + 170 + 108 + 511 = 1443\n\nSince my outside offer is 919, I should propose keeping items that contribute a value significantly higher than 919 to me.\n\n**Example Calculation for an Offer:**\n\nSuppose I keep:\n- 9 units of item 2 (worth 94 each)\n- 5 units of item 3 (worth 34 each)\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n- Item 2: 6 x 94 = 564\n- Item 3: 5 x 34 = 170\n\nLet's add:\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 0\n\nTotal value for me = 564 + 170 = 734, which is less than 919. So, I should adjust it.\n\n**Refined Offer Calculation:**\n\nLet's try a distribution that crosses 919:\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 x 94 = 376\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 x 34 = 170\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 54 = 108\n\nTotal value (let's say no units of item 1 or 5) = 376 + 170 + 108 = 654 (still less than 919)\n\n**Let's evaluate a different combination:**\n\nConsider:\n- 6 units of item 2 (worth 564)\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 34\n- 2 units of item 4 = 108\n- 7 units of item 5 = 7 x 73 = 511\n\nTotal value for me = 564 + 34 + 108 + 511 = 1217\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer of 919.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on the analysis.\n\nI will make a counteroffer that ensures I retain a value greater than 919. According to the calculations above, a combination like this might work:\n\n- Offer: [9, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n- This means I keep: [0, 6, 1, 2, 7]\n\nTherefore, my action will be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [9, 0, 4, 0, 0]}\n```\n\nWith this offer, I keep items that have a total value of 1217 for me, which is better than my outside offer.",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 3, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 94 x 5 + 34 x 3 + 54 x 1 + 73 x 4\n    which is 918 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 919. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [9, 0, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 0, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 0, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best action to take in this negotiation, let's follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 919.\n   - My private values per unit are: 10 for item 1, 94 for item 2, 34 for item 3, 54 for item 4, 73 for item 5.\n   - The total pool of items consists of 9 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, which means if the negotiation extends into further rounds, the value I attain will be multiplied by gamma^(r-1) where r is the current round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [3, 2, 0, 0, 5] is being offered to me.\n     - Value of this offer to me:\n       - Item 1: 3 units x 10 = 30\n       - Item 2: 2 units x 94 = 188\n       - Item 3: 0 units x 34 = 0\n       - Item 4: 0 units x 54 = 0\n       - Item 5: 5 units x 73 = 365\n       - Total value = 30 + 188 + 0 + 0 + 365 = 583\n\n   - These values are not discounted for this round yet. Since it's round 2, apply the discount factor:\n     - Adjusted value = 583 x 0.9^(2-1) = 583 x 0.9 = 524.7\n\n   - Since 524.7 is less than my outside offer (919), I should not accept the current offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I will not accept the current offer because its value (524.7) is less than my guaranteed outside offer (919).\n   - I should determine a counteroffer. My counteroffer should exceed the value of my outside offer.\n\n   Let's calculate one possible favorable counteroffer:\n   - To maximize value, I attempt to keep high-value items myself.\n   - Suppose I offer [7, 1, 2, 0, 5] to Player 2.\n   - This means I keep [2, 5, 3, 2, 2] for myself.\n     - My value:\n       - Item 1: 2 units x 10 = 20\n       - Item 2: 5 units x 94 = 470\n       - Item 3: 3 units x 34 = 102\n       - Item 4: 2 units x 54 = 108\n       - Item 5: 2 units x 73 = 146\n       - Total value = 20 + 470 + 102 + 108 + 146 = 846\n\n   - The value of this counteroffer is still less than my outside offer, so let's readjust.\n\n   - New example counteroffer: [8, 1, 1, 0, 6]\n     - This means I keep [1, 5, 4, 2, 1] for myself.\n       - My value:\n         - Item 1: 1 unit x 10 = 10\n         - Item 2: 5 units x 94 = 470\n         - Item 3: 4 units x 34 = 136\n         - Item 4: 2 units x 54 = 108\n         - Item 5: 1 unit x 73 = 73\n         - Total value = 10 + 470 + 136 + 108 + 73 = 797\n\n   - I realize this does not exceed my outside offer either. More attempts similarly show the difficulty of exceeding my outside offer substantially.\n\nGiven these calculations where it's difficult to consistently construct an offer obviously better than my outside offer on short notice within the constraints given, I must adopt a more straightforward approach resembling my outside offer value better.\n\n   - Given the negotiations format and to optimize beyond losses to yield value, I consider simply focusing not to exceed nor avoid such risk beyond this.\n\nTherefore, since I am finding difficulty to construct beyond the outside offer elsewhere currently, the action conclusion is:\n   - **WALK** - as it provides a guaranteed value of 919.\n\nAccordingly, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 4, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 57 x 2 + 41 x 1 + 22 x 4 + 53 x 7\n    which is 614 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 616. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your value would be:\n    96 x 4 + 40 x 3 + 59 x 3 + 65 x 4 + 83 x 1\n    which is 1024 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1025. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 3, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 4 + 40 x 3 + 59 x 3 + 65 x 4 + 83 x 1\n    which is 1024 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1025. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I want to maximize my value while giving Player 1 enough to accept.\n\nSince I value item 1 the most (97 per unit), I should keep as many of those as possible.\nI value items 3 and 4 moderately (30 each).\nItems 2 and 5 have low value for me (1 and 7).\n\nLooking at Player 1's previous offers:\n- Initially they offered me [3, 1, 0, 1, 1] (keeping 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 2 of item 5)\n- Now they offered [3, 1, 0, 0, 1] (keeping 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 2 of item 5)\n\nThey seem to value items 3 and 4 highly, while being willing to give me some of item 1.\n\nI'll try a counteroffer where I keep more of item 1 and give more of the items Player 1 seems to value:\n- I'll keep 5 units of item 1 (giving 2 to Player 1)\n- I'll keep 1 unit of item 2 (giving 3 to Player 1)\n- I'll give all 3 units of item 3 to Player 1\n- I'll give 4 units of item 4 to Player 1 (keeping 1)\n- I'll give 2 units of item 5 to Player 1 (keeping 1)\n\nSo my counteroffer to Player 1 would be [2, 3, 3, 4, 2]\n\nThis would leave me with [5, 1, 0, 1, 1] for a value of (5 \u00d7 97) + (1 \u00d7 1) + (0 \u00d7 30) + (1 \u00d7 30) + (1 \u00d7 7) = 485 + 1 + 0 + 30 + 7 = 523\nWith discount: 523 \u00d7 0.9 = 470.7, which is much better than the current offer of 269.1\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 3, 4, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1025. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1029 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 3, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 4 + 40 x 3 + 59 x 3 + 65 x 4 + 83 x 1\n    which is 1024 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1025. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 2, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 3, 4, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 3, 4, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Accepting the current offer will yield less than the outside offer.\n\n- Since the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer and creating a counteroffer that might improve my position is not an option due to it being round 3, the best course of action is to walk away and take the outside offer.\n\nTherefore, the optimal action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 403. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 501 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 9 x 0 + 48 x 3 + 28 x 4 + 73 x 2\n    which is 402 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 403. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I'll keep sufficient items to ensure my value exceeds 403 even after discounting:\n\n- Proposed distribution for myself: [3, 0, 4, 2, 3]\n  - Calculate the value retained:\n    - \\(3 \\times 9 + 0 \\times 9 + 4 \\times 48 + 2 \\times 28 + 3 \\times 73 = 27 + 0 + 192 + 56 + 219 = 494\\)\n  - With discounting in round 2: \\(494 \\times 0.9 = 444.6\\)\n\nThe proposed distribution offers a value greater than my outside offer when accounting for the discount factor. Thus, a valid counteroffer could be:\n\n- Counteroffer to give Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\nSince this counteroffer value for me exceeds my outside offer value even after applying the discount factor, it's a viable option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step by step before deciding on the appropriate action.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 403.\n- **Values of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 9 per unit.\n  - Item 2: 9 per unit.\n  - Item 3: 48 per unit.\n  - Item 4: 28 per unit.\n  - Item 5: 73 per unit.\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** Since it is round 3, any offer accepted now will not be discounted, i.e., the value will be multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer to Me:** [3, 0, 4, 1, 1]\n  - Compute the value if I accept:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = \\( 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\)\n    - 0 units of item 2 = \\( 0 \\times 9 = 0 \\)\n    - 4 units of item 3 = \\( 4 \\times 48 = 192 \\)\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = \\( 1 \\times 28 = 28 \\)\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = \\( 1 \\times 73 = 73 \\)\n  - Total value = \\( 27 + 0 + 192 + 28 + 73 = 320 \\)\n\n- **Comparison:**\n  - The value of the current offer (320) is less than my outside offer (403).\n  - Therefore, accepting this offer would result in a lower payoff than walking away with the outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nWhen considering my actions:\n- Accept the current offer? **No** (since the value is less than my outside offer).\n- Walk away and take the outside offer? Yes, because the current offer value (320) is lower than my guaranteed fallback of 403.\n- Propose a specific counteroffer? Since it's the last round and a counteroffer from Player 2 will turn into a walk, a counteroffer seems less viable.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action to maximize my value, given the situation, is to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
