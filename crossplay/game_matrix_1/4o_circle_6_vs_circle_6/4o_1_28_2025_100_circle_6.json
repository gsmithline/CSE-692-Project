Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 910. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 910. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 957 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 4, 4, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    77 x 1 + 68 x 0 + 62 x 4 + 44 x 4 + 68 x 6\n    which is 909 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 910. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Let\u2019s calculate the potential values by retaining more high-value items:\n\n- Let's try to keep 2 units of items 1 and 2 (high value), 4 units of item 3, which is moderately valued, and some units of item 5 since it's also valued high.\n\n#### Keeping: [2, 2, 4, 0, 4]\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n- 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\n\n**Total Value of Retained Items: 154 + 136 + 248 + 0 + 272 = 810**\n\nUnfortunately, this combination is still less than the outside offer of 910. Let's attempt another combination.\n\n#### Keeping: [3, 5, 7, 3, 5]\nEffectively offering Player 2: [0, 1, 0, 3, 3]\n\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 68 = 340\n- 7 units of item 3 = 7 \u00d7 62 = 434\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 68 = 340\n\n**Total Value of Retained Items: 231 + 340 + 434 + 132 + 340 = 1477**\n\nThis combination exceeds my outside offer. However, it leaves Player 2 with possibly less desirable terms. I will attempt slightly different allocation.\n\n#### Keeping: [1, 3, 4, 4, 5]\nEffectively offering Player 2: [2, 3, 3, 2, 3]\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 77 = 77\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 44 = 176\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 68 = 340\n\n**Total Value of Retained Items: 77 + 204 + 248 + 176 + 340 = 1045**\n\nThe value of 1045 exceeds my outside offer while still presenting what might be an attractive balance for Player 2.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis counteroffer leaves me with a total value of 1045, which is greater than my outside offer of 910, making it desirable for me. Assuming the offer could also be of interest to Player 2, I will propose this as a counteroffer.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 3, 2, 3]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1613. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1613. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1086 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 0, 5, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 3 + 100 x 5 + 91 x 0 + 72 x 5 + 91 x 8\n    which is 1612 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1613. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 3, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 3, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 3, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 0 + 23 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 94 x 0 + 1 x 2\n    which is 2 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 11. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Therefore, securing a good initial offer is crucial.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - I need to determine a potential counteroffer that maximizes my value above my outside offer of 11. \n   - For example, if I aim to keep as much value as possible, I would prefer to keep most of high-value items - item 3 and item 4.\n\n     For illustration:\n     - Suppose I propose keeping all units of item 3 and item 4, and give away all units of item 1, item 2, and item 5.\n     - My proposed division: [3, 5, 0, 0, 2] means I keep 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n     - Value:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 39 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 23 = 0\n       - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 96 = 384\n       - 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 94 = 564\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n     - Total value = 384 + 564 = 948\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - The total value of 948 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 11.\n   - Ensure my proposal does not fall into any of the outlined mistakes: \n     - It is not worse than taking my outside offer since 948 > 11.\n     - It is not worse than keeping everything since 948 is less than the total value of keeping all items (1182).\n\nHence, I propose an initial offer where I retain all of the high-value items (item 3 and item 4) and offer remaining items (item 1, item 2, and item 5) to Player 2. This is a strategic initial offer balancing between maximizing my own value and exploring Player 2's possible preferences. \n\nMy proposed offer is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 5, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

Hence, this counteroffer is reasonable and avoids the listed mistakes:\n\n- It does not make an offer worse for me than my outside offer.\n- It is neither nothing nor everything to the opponent.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\nBased on the calculations above, I will make a counteroffer that maintains maximum value for me in the first round to leverage the highest probability of acceptance without waiting for future rounds to be affected by a discount.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 542. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1017 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 4, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 0 + 83 x 2 + 21 x 4 + 39 x 5 + 96 x 1\n    which is 541 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 542. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on my action, I will follow the step-by-step analysis outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 542.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 100\n     - Item 2: 83\n     - Item 3: 21\n     - Item 4: 39\n     - Item 5: 96\n   - Total pool of items is: [0, 3, 4, 5, 7]\n   - The discount factor influences the value by multiplying it with 0.9 raised to the power of the number of rounds minus one. As we are in round 1, the influence is minor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Value of current offer:**\n     - I get [0, 2, 2, 2, 1] (because Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 2, 3, 6], meaning I retain the remainder).\n     - Total value if I accept the current offer:\n       - Item 1: 0 units x 100 = 0\n       - Item 2: 2 units x 83 = 166\n       - Item 3: 2 units x 21 = 42\n       - Item 4: 2 units x 39 = 78\n       - Item 5: 1 unit x 96 = 96\n       - Total = 382\n     - The value of this offer (382) is less than my outside offer (542).\n\n   - **Evaluating potential counteroffers:**\n     - I need a counteroffer where my retained units' value exceeds 542. Some options to consider:\n       - For example, keep [0, 3, 4, 3, 0] (offering [0, 0, 0, 2, 7]):\n         - Item 1: 0 units x 100 = 0\n         - Item 2: 3 units x 83 = 249\n         - Item 3: 4 units x 21 = 84\n         - Item 4: 3 units x 39 = 117\n         - Item 5: 0 units x 96 = 0\n         - Total = 450\n       - This is still below my outside offer, so I need a more favorable division.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is below my outside offer.\n   - Before the end of negotiations, I should push for a division better than my outside offer.\n   - Based on my calculations, I need to adjust items to keep more high-value items.\n   \n   Let's try keeping more of item 2 and item 5, which are highest in value:\n   - Example where [0, 1, 1, 3, 6] is offered to Player 1:\n     - Retained: [0, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n     - Value = (0 x 100) + (2 x 83) + (3 x 21) + (2 x 39) + (1 x 96) = 482\n   \n   This still does not surpass my outside offer, thus:\n   - Next with [0, 0, 4, 4, 5]:\n     - Player 1 gets [0, 3, 0, 1, 2], and I'd retain: [0, 0, 4, 4, 5].\n     - Value: (0 x 100) + (0 x 83) + (4 x 21) + (4 x 39) + (5 x 96) = 84 + 156 + 480 = 720\n\nThis allocation maximizes my total value above my outside offer while maintaining rationality regarding item value preference.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to distribute the items in a way that maximizes their value to me.\n\n3) **Determine a Counteroffer:**\n    - Calculate an example counteroffer, aiming to exceed the outside offer value of 655.\n    - Consider keeping more units of higher-value items:\n      - Try keeping more of item 2 and item 3, as they both have high values for me.\n      - Offer lower quantities of these to Player 2 while maximizing my own value, but ensuring my offer to them is still reasonable.\n\nLet's construct my proposal by retaining the following units for myself:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 5 units\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nCalculate total retained value:\n- Value from Item 1 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n- Value from Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n- Value from Item 3 = 5 \u00d7 76 = 380\n- Value from Item 4 = 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n- Value from Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n\nTotal retained value = 33 + 152 + 380 + 0 + 43 = 608\n\nThis offer doesn't exceed my outside offer value of 655. I need to adjust to increase the total maintained value above this amount. Let's try adjusting to keep more of item 2, as it carries a high value.\n\nAttempt a new allocation:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 3 units\n- Item 3: 6 units\n- Item 4: 0 unit\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nRecalculate:\n- Value from Item 1 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n- Value from Item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228\n- Value from Item 3 = 6 \u00d7 76 = 456\n- Value from Item 4 = 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n- Value from Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 43 = 43\n\nTotal retained value = 33 + 228 + 456 + 0 + 43 = 760\n\nThis value exceeds my outside offer value of 655.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 46. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 8 x 2 + 77 x 0 + 29 x 1\n    which is 45 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 46. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 0, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 0, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1135. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 6, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 6 + 98 x 6 + 7 x 4 + 82 x 2 + 92 x 3\n    which is 1134 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1135. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 6, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 6 + 98 x 6 + 7 x 4 + 82 x 2 + 92 x 3\n    which is 1134 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1135. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I will proceed with the analysis step-by-step as guided:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 517.\n   - My values per unit are: Item 1 = 38, Item 2 = 33, Item 3 = 65, Item 4 = 16, Item 5 = 16.\n   - The total pool of items consists of 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, which means future rounds diminish the value of the negotiated outcome by a factor of gamma, making current higher value deals preferable.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - **Current offer from Player 1:** [2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5]\n     - Value to me: \n       - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 38 = 76\n       - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 33 = 0\n       - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 65 = 260\n       - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 16 = 32\n       - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 16 = 16\n     - Total value if I accept: 76 + 0 + 260 + 32 + 16 = 384\n\n   The total value of 384 is less than my outside offer of 517. Therefore, accepting this offer is not beneficial for me, as per Mistake 4 guideline.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   Based on calculated values, I should neither accept the current offer nor walk away with my outside offer, as there's still room for reaching a better outcome. Therefore, a counteroffer is warranted.\n\nI need to design a counteroffer that results in a value greater than my outside offer of 517. Here's an example calculation for that:\n\n   Let's propose giving Player 1:\n   - [1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5]\n   \n   The corresponding items left for me will remain:\n   - [6 - 1 = 5 units of item 1, 3 - 1 = 2 units of item 2, 9 - 4 = 5 units of item 3, 6 - 2 = 4 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5]\n\n   Calculating value for this division (my values):\n   - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 38 = 190\n   - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 33 = 66\n   - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 65 = 325\n   - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 16 = 64\n   - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 16 = 64\n   - Total value = 190 + 66 + 325 + 64 + 64 = 709\n\nSince 709 is greater than my outside offer value of 517, this counteroffer should satisfy my objectives.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 4, 2, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1622. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1098 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 8, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 5 + 74 x 1 + 73 x 8 + 48 x 6 + 90 x 3\n    which is 1621 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1622. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 4, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 4, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 5, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 5, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 5, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

In this case, we are in round 1, so the discount factor is 1 (0.9^0).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to propose an initial counteroffer that ensures my obtained value is higher than my outside offer value of 345.\n\n- **Example counteroffer evaluation (where I give 2 units of each item to Player 2)**:\n  - I would keep 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 41 = 123\n  - I would keep 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n  - I would keep 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n  - Total value: 123 + 82 + 144 = 349\n\nThis arrangement provides me with a value of 349, which is greater than my outside offer of 345.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nSince I aim to maximize my valuation while avoiding the mistakes outlined, I will offer Player 2 a division that leaves me with a value higher than my outside option.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 345. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 345. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 507 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 4 + 41 x 4 + 42 x 0 + 36 x 0 + 9 x 0\n    which is 328 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 345. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation and evaluate the offers step-by-step. \n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** 476. This is the minimum value our negotiated offer should provide us. \n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 15 (0 items available)\n  - Item 2: 80 (4 items available)\n  - Item 3: 1 (1 item available)\n  - Item 4: 72 (4 items available)\n  - Item 5: 54 (4 items available)\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - Item 1: 0\n  - Item 2: 4\n  - Item 3: 1\n  - Item 4: 4\n  - Item 5: 4\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** As it is round 1, the discount factor hasn't yet impacted the negotiation outcome, but future rounds will decrease the value with a factor of 0.9 for each additional round.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n#### Current Offer from Player 1:\n- Current offer on the table is: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] (this is what we are given)\n- Calculating its value to us:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 15 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n- Total Value = 80 + 72 + 54 = 206\n\nThe value of the current offer (206) is significantly below our outside offer value (476). Therefore, it is not beneficial for us to accept.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\n\nWe must propose a counteroffer that ensures a total personal value greater than 476 while offering a reasonable split to the other player. \n\nLet's calculate for counteroffer [0, 2, 0, 2, 2] if we keep:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 15 = 0\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n\nResulting in: \n- Total Value = 0 + 160 + 1 + 144 + 108 = 413\n\n413 is still below 476, indicating that this offer is not good enough for us yet. Therefore, let's make an adjustment, keeping more units of the higher-value items.\n\nSuppose we try to keep: [0, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 15 = 0\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n\nSo, the total value:\n- Total Value = 240 + 1 + 216 + 54 = 511\n\nThe total value of 511 is above our outside value of 476, making it a potential counteroffer. \n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nWe will go ahead with a counteroffer to maximize our value:\n- **Counteroffer:** [0, 1, 0, 1, 3] (to Player 1)\n\nThis means we keep: [0, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n\nHere is the action as JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 3]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 1, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 12 x 4 + 83 x 1 + 70 x 0 + 44 x 4\n    which is 307 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 308.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 308. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 855 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 1, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 12 x 4 + 83 x 1 + 70 x 0 + 44 x 4\n    which is 307 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 308. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This affects our decision because any value calculations we make must consider this decline in the total effective value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n     - My total value if I accept:\n       - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 76 = 0\n       - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 12 = 12\n       - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 83 = 0\n       - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 70 = 70\n       - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 44 = 44\n     - Total Value = 126\n     - Adjusted for Discount = 126 \u00d7 0.81 = 102.06\n     - Compared to Outside Offer = 102.06 < 308, so this is worse than taking my outside offer.\n  \n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer provides a resultant value of 102.06 after discounting, which is significantly less than my outside offer value of 308.\n   - Since it's the final round, offering a counteroffer means it acts as a walk since Player 2 can no longer respond, so the remaining option is to choose the better alternative: **Walking away guarantees a value of 308**.\n\nTherefore, based on the value analysis, the optimal action is to walk away. Accepting the current offer is worse than taking my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 508. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 546 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 69 x 4 + 67 x 3 + 10 x 3 + 28 x 0\n    which is 507 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 508. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 69 x 4 + 67 x 3 + 10 x 3 + 28 x 0\n    which is 507 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 508. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 7, 4, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 7, 4, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 83. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 336 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 15 x 1 + 21 x 0 + 7 x 1 + 57 x 1\n    which is 79 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 83. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

The value comparisons are direct between my calculations and my outside offer.\n\n2) **Assessing the Value of Offers**:\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2. Hence, I should consider potential advantageous counteroffers.\n   - To ensure I do not fall below my outside offer value of 83, any counteroffer must give me a value > 83.\n\n3) **Calculate Potential Counteroffers**:\n   - Let's first look at an initial possible division:\n     - Keep: 0 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 5 of Item 3, 2 of Item 4, 3 of Item 5\n     - Give: 0 of Item 1, 1 of Item 2, 2 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, 2 of Item 5\n  \n   - **Value of Keeping**:\n     - 0 units of Item 1 = 12 x 0 = 0\n     - 1 unit of Item 2 = 15 x 1 = 15\n     - 5 units of Item 3 = 21 x 5 = 105\n     - 2 units of Item 4 = 7 x 2 = 14\n     - 3 units of Item 5 = 57 x 3 = 171\n     - Total value of keeping = 305\n\n   This value is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 83, making it a strong initial offer.\n\nTo avoid the mistakes outlined, I ensure:\n- The counteroffer achieves a higher value for me than my outside offer.\n- It is not a worse offer than before because there are no previous offers.\n- I do not offer all or nothing initially.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]}",

Let's take the following examples:\n\n**Test Offer 1: Give Player 2 the majority of lower valued items: [0, 0, 4, 0, 4]**\n\n- My remaining items: \n  - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n  - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 74 = 222\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 85 = 0\n\n- My total value: 108 + 216 + 66 + 222 + 0 = 612\n\nThe remaining value 612 is substantially higher than my outside offer of 323.\n\n#### My Counteroffer\nTo maximize my value without being unfair, I will propose this division:\n\n- Keep majority of higher value items and let go lower ones, i.e., [0, 2, 3, 0, 4].\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\n\nGiven the analysis, I will make a counteroffer that is significantly better than my outside option:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 0, 4]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 970. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 970. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 879 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 6, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 0 + 89 x 4 + 71 x 6 + 11 x 0 + 62 x 3\n    which is 968 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 970. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 1 + 42 x 1 + 32 x 0 + 100 x 3 + 10 x 5\n    which is 461 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 462. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 4 x 1 + 61 x 4 + 82 x 2 + 54 x 4\n    which is 628 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 630. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, neither accepting nor walking is ideal at this point since walking would also lead to receiving only the outside offer value, with no opportunity to improve the outcome by negotiation in further rounds. Instead, I should propose a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\nOne possible counteroffer could focus on retaining high-value items for myself while offering less valuable items to the other player, yet ensuring that the combined value exceeds 630:\n\nFor instance, keeping [3, 0, 3, 3, 4] and offering the rest to Player 1:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 x 8 = 24\n   - 0 units of item 2 = 0 x 4 = 0\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 x 61 = 183\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 x 82 = 246\n   - 4 units of item 5 = 4 x 54 = 216\n   - Total value = 24 + 0 + 183 + 246 + 216 = 669\n\nSince 669 is greater than 630, I'll propose the following counteroffer:\n- Offer [2, 1, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1\n\nThus, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 216. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 591 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 1 + 43 x 1 + 18 x 2 + 52 x 1 + 56 x 1\n    which is 215 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 216. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 384. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 903 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 1 + 82 x 0 + 43 x 1 + 46 x 3 + 36 x 3\n    which is 383 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 384. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [7, 3, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [7, 3, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 0 + 22 x 1 + 92 x 0 + 73 x 4 + 34 x 1\n    which is 348 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 349. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 6, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 6, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 550. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 726 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    15 x 0 + 71 x 3 + 73 x 3 + 49 x 1 + 34 x 2\n    which is 549 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 550. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 2 + 60 x 0 + 54 x 2 + 23 x 0 + 73 x 4\n    which is 436 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 437. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, I should consider offers that provide a sufficient advantage over my outside offer after discounting.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\nSince it's the first round, there's no current offer from Player 2. My task is to propose an initial offer that maximizes my value while surpassing the outside offer.\n\n- **Value of Keeping All Items**:\n  - 2 units of item 1: \\( 2 \\times 69 = 138 \\)\n  - 4 units of item 2: \\( 4 \\times 78 = 312 \\)\n  - 4 units of item 3: \\( 4 \\times 92 = 368 \\)\n  - 0 units of item 4: \\( 0 \\times 60 = 0 \\)\n  - 3 units of item 5: \\( 3 \\times 100 = 300 \\)\n  \n  Total value = 1118\n\nSince my total valuation of keeping all items is 1118, my strategy will be to propose a division where I retain enough value above my outside offer of 320.\n\n- **Potential Offer Calculation**:\n  - Let's propose offering Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n\n- **Calculate My Value for Keeping the Rest**:\n  - 2 units of item 1: \\( 2 \\times 69 = 138 \\)\n  - 2 units of item 2: \\( 2 \\times 78 = 156 \\)\n  - 2 units of item 3: \\( 2 \\times 92 = 184 \\)\n  - 0 units of item 4: \\( 0 \\times 60 = 0 \\)\n  - 2 units of item 5: \\( 2 \\times 100 = 200 \\)\n\n  Total value if I keep these = 678\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nThe value of my proposed holding (678) significantly exceeds my outside offer (320). It is a suitable counteroffer for the initial round as it gives me substantial value while leaving Player 2 with some items, potentially appealing to them.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 0 + 41 x 1 + 35 x 3 + 14 x 0 + 8 x 0\n    which is 146 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 147.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    30 x 4 + 25 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 52 x 4 + 53 x 0\n    which is 328 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 329. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 615. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 615. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 774 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 0 + 39 x 3 + 49 x 1 + 72 x 3 + 58 x 4\n    which is 614 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 615. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 1 + 23 x 0 + 66 x 0 + 49 x 0 + 34 x 1\n    which is 105 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 115. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

My goal is to ensure the value I receive is greater than my outside offer of 115.\n\n#### Potential Offers and Their Values to Me:\n1. **Keeping more higher-valued items like item 1 and item 3:**\n   - Offer to Player 2: [0, 0, 1, 3, 2]\n   - My items: [2, 0, 2, 3, 2]\n   - My value: (2 \u00d7 71) + (2 \u00d7 66) + (3 \u00d7 49) + (2 \u00d7 34) = 142 + 132 + 147 + 68 = 489\n\n2. **Balancing the items:** \n   - Offer to Player 2: [1, 0, 2, 4, 3]\n   - My items: [1, 0, 1, 2, 1]\n   - My value: (1 \u00d7 71) + (1 \u00d7 66) + (2 \u00d7 49) + (1 \u00d7 34) = 71 + 66 + 98 + 34 = 269\n\n3. **Conservatively taking most of item 5 while leaving more of item 4:**\n   - Offer to Player 2: [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]\n   - My items: [1, 0, 1, 4, 3]\n   - My value: (1 \u00d7 71) + (1 \u00d7 66) + (4 \u00d7 49) + (3 \u00d7 34) = 71 + 66 + 196 + 102 = 435\n\nAll these potential offers result in a value greater than my outside offer of 115. Thus, I will choose the most balanced offer that maximizes my value early on, while remaining highly competitive if Player 2's outside offer value is relatively low.\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\nGiven the analysis, I will propose the counteroffer that retains significant value for myself and leaves room for further negotiation by balancing the division:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 220. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 220. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 4 x 2 + 91 x 0 + 47 x 1 + 82 x 2\n    which is 219 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 220. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 28 for item 1, 6 for item 2, 62 for item 3, 59 for item 4, 54 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 954. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 122. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 122. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 62 x 1 + 59 x 1 + 54 x 0\n    which is 121 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 122. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 5, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 5, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 122.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 28\n     - Item 2: 6\n     - Item 3: 62\n     - Item 4: 59\n     - Item 5: 54\n   - The total pool of items is [2, 3, 5, 6, 4].\n   - The discount factor for future rounds is gamma = 0.9. This means the value of any deal reached in a subsequent round will be multiplied by 0.9 per round delay.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3]** (this is what's being offered to me):\n     - Value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 28 = 0\n       - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n       - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 59 = 295\n       - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n     - Total Value = 0 + 6 + 124 + 295 + 162 = 587\n\n   - The total value of accepting this offer is 587, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 122.\n\n3) **Decision making:**\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me a value of 587.\n   - My outside offer is 122, which is much lower than 587.\n   - The current offer is very favorable to me as it has much higher value than my outside offer.\n\nTo avoid mistake 5 (Walking away from an offer better than my outside offer), and considering the significant higher value this offer has compared to my outside offer, the best course of action is to accept the current offer.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1188. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 927 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 3, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 2 + 84 x 4 + 29 x 3 + 22 x 7 + 87 x 5\n    which is 1186 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1188. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To evaluate the current situation, I'll proceed step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1188.\n   - My values per unit for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 87\n     - Item 2: 84\n     - Item 3: 29\n     - Item 4: 22\n     - Item 5: 87\n   - Total pool of items: [4, 5, 5, 7, 5]\n   - Discount factor: In round 1, no discount is applied yet, so it doesn't influence the value at this point.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer on the table (what I would receive if I accept): [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n     - Value to me if I accept this offer:\n       - 1 unit of item 1: 1 x 87 = 87\n       - 1 unit of item 2: 1 x 84 = 84\n       - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 29 = 58\n       - 2 units of item 4: 2 x 22 = 44\n       - 0 units of item 5: 0 x 87 = 0\n     - Total value: 87 + 84 + 58 + 44 + 0 = 273\n\nSince 273 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1188, accepting this offer would be a mistake because it provides a lower value than my fallback. Therefore, I need to consider a counteroffer.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - To avoid mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer), I'll aim to create a counteroffer that is more beneficial than my outside offer. I need to keep more items with high value to me, such as items 1, 2, and 5, while potentially giving away more of item 3 and 4, which have lower values to me.\n   - Let's propose a counteroffer and calculate its value:\n     - Offer: [2, 3, 4, 5, 2] to Player 1\n     - This means I keep: [2, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n     - Calculate the value of what I keep:\n       - 2 units of item 1: 2 x 87 = 174\n       - 2 units of item 2: 2 x 84 = 168\n       - 1 unit of item 3: 1 x 29 = 29\n       - 2 units of item 4: 2 x 22 = 44\n       - 3 units of item 5: 3 x 87 = 261\n     - Total value: 174 + 168 + 29 + 44 + 261 = 676\n\nThe proposed distribution (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) yields a total value of 676, which is still less than my outside offer of 1188. Therefore, I need to further adjust my offer.\n\nAfter further adjustment:\n   - Offer: [3, 4, 5, 5, 2] to Player 1\n   - This means I keep: [1, 1, 0, 2, 3]\n   - Calculate the value of what I keep:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 x 87 = 87\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 x 84 = 84\n     - 0 units of item 3: 0 x 29 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 x 22 = 44\n     - 3 units of item 5: 3 x 87 = 261\n   - Total value: 87 + 84 + 0 + 44 + 261 = 476\n\nAttempting further adjustments did not surpass my outside offer.\n\nGiven these calculations, I should refrain from making offers that don't improve my situation. Additionally, given that my outside offer is quite high compared to what's feasible here, it's challenging to make an offer that surpasses this fallback value without significant concessions from Player 1. I need to gather more information through negotiation or reconsider my strategy.\n\nUltimately, since my objective is to avoid accepting an unfavorable deal or walking away from a better offer, and my current calculations show lower prospective outcomes than my fallback, I will choose the WALK option to rely on my outside offer. \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 2, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 4 + 80 x 5 + 24 x 2 + 62 x 4 + 42 x 0\n    which is 1072 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1074. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation and decide the optimal move:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1074.\n   - My values for each item are: \n     - Item 1: 94\n     - Item 2: 80\n     - Item 3: 24\n     - Item 4: 62\n     - Item 5: 42\n   - The total pool of items consists of 10 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 7 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, which influences the future value when deciding if waiting is beneficial.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: [0, 3, 0, 1, 0]\n     - Item 1: 0 units = 0 value\n     - Item 2: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240\n     - Item 3: 0 units = 0 value\n     - Item 4: 1 unit  = 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n     - Item 5: 0 units = 0 value\n     - Total value = 302\n\nThe value of accepting the current offer is 302, which is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 1074. Thus, accepting this offer would result in a loss compared to my outside option.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting is not wise as 302 < 1074 (which would be Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away is an option but let's see if we can construct a better counteroffer to maximize the outcome.\n   - Construct a counteroffer that achieves a value over 1074.\n\nI can attempt to retain items that hold higher value for me. Here's a hypothetical division:\n   - Give player 1: [5, 3, 5, 3, 0]\n   - Keep for myself: [5, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n\nValue calculation for this counteroffer:\n   - Item 1: 5 units = 5 \u00d7 94 = 470\n   - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n   - Item 3: 0 units = 0 value\n   - Item 4: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n   - Item 5: 0 units = 0 value\n   - Total value = 470 + 160 + 248 = 878\n\nI slightly changed the item 4 to keep more, but the value of this counteroffer is better than the current one but slightly lower than my outside option. Let's tweak again to maximize:\n\nLet's give Player 1: [4, 3, 5, 3, 0]\n   - Keeping for myself: [6, 2, 0, 4, 0]\n\nValue calculation for this counteroffer:\n   - Item 1: 6 units = 6 \u00d7 94 = 564\n   - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n   - Item 3: 0 units = 0 value\n   - Item 4: 4 units = 4 \u00d7 62 = 248\n   - Item 5: 0 units = 0 value\n   - Total value = 564 + 160 + 248 = 972\n\nStill below 1074. This means I should consider keeping only two items of item 1:\n   - Keeping for myself: [8, 2, 0, 5, 0]\n\nValue calculation for this counteroffer:\n   - Item 1: 8 units = 8 \u00d7 94 = 752\n   - Item 2: 2 units = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n   - Item 3: 0 units = 0 value\n   - Item 4: 5 units = 5 \u00d7 62 = 310\n   - Item 5: 0 units = 0 value\n   - Total value = 752 + 160 + 310 = 1222\n\nNow, offering: [2, 3, 5, 2, 0]\nThis has a value of 1222, which is above my outside offer.

My key items by value per unit are item 2 (75) and item 4 (85).\n   - I should try to keep at least one of item 4 and maximize item 2.\n   - A potential offer where I keep a high value and give up the least valuable items but still exceed 228 needs to be calculated.\n\nI will propose an offer where I keep most valuable items while getting a total value more than 228:\n- Keeping all of item 2, one of item 4, and strategically optimizing the rest.\n- Proposal: [1, 0, 5, 1, 1]\n  - My kept items would then be [1, 1, 2, 1, 1].\n\nLet's calculate the value:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 85 = 85\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n- Total value = 267\n\nThis value of 267 is greater than my outside offer of 228.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 5, 1, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 2 + 17 x 0 + 10 x 5 + 48 x 2 + 92 x 2\n    which is 498 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 500. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 5, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 5, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Accepting it would not be wise.\n   - A counteroffer should aim to maximize my value while being realistic enough to be considered by Player 1.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer giving Player 1 a reasonable share, but ensuring I get more value than the outside offer:\n- Counteroffer: [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]\n  - Units retained by me:\n    - Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2 (value = 168)\n    - Item 2: 0 units (value = 0)\n    - Item 3: 4 units (value = 40)\n    - Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2 (value = 96)\n    - Item 5: 2 - 0 = 2 (value = 184)\n  - Total value = 488, which is below my outside offer; I need to adjust.\n\nLet's adjust to improve the value:\n- Counteroffer: [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n  - Units retained by me:\n    - Item 1: 2 (value = 168)\n    - Item 2: 0 (value = 0)\n    - Item 3: 5 (value = 50)\n    - Item 4: 2 (value = 96)\n    - Item 5: 1 (value = 92)\n  - Adjusted total value = 406, still below my outside offer.\n\nFinally, let's improve:\n- Conservative yet appealing form:\n- Counteroffer: [1, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n  - Units retained by me:\n    - Item 1: 1 (value = 84)\n    - Item 2: 0 (value = 0)\n    - Item 3: 5 (value = 50)\n    - Item 4: 2 (value = 96)\n    - Item 5: 1 (value = 92)\n  - Total value = 322, still lower\n\nAdjust once more with more units retained:\n- [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n  - Units retained by me:\n    - Item 1: 2 (value = 168)\n    - Item 2: 1 (value = 17)\n    - Item 3: 5 (value = 50)\n    - Item 4: 2 (value = 96)\n    - Item 5: 1 (value = 92)\n  - Adjusted total value = 423, adjusted to maximize winnable value.\n\nUltimately, I will walk if I can't propose an offer with a realistic value exceeding my outside offer. A considerate counteroffer to incentivize settlement is a step-wise tussle.\n\nGiven the difficulty in exceeding the outside offer outright, and iteration constraints, suggest:\n- **Action:** {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

However, it is important for subsequent rounds if no immediate agreement is reached.\n\n2. **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - As there is no current offer on the table, I'll prepare an initial counteroffer and calculate its value to ensure it exceeds my outside offer.\n   - A simple strategy could be to try to keep higher-value items (to me) in such a way that I achieve a higher total than my outside offer.\n\n3. **Make a Decision:**\n   - Given my valuations, I should propose an initial counteroffer strategically that provides me a value above 1049 based on what I keep.\n   - Start by determining valuable items: Item 3 and Item 2 are particularly high value for me.\n\nLet\u2019s check some possible allocations I could keep that give a total above 1049:\n\n- If I keep:\n  - 2 units of item 1 (value: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72)\n  - 0 units of item 2 (value: 0 \u00d7 65 = 0)\n  - 5 units of item 3 (value: 5 \u00d7 78 = 390)\n  - 3 units of item 4 (value: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126)\n  - 4 units of item 5 (value: 4 \u00d7 42 = 168)\n\n  Calculation of kept total value: \n  \\(72 + 0 + 390 + 126 + 168 = 756\\).\n\nHowever, this is clearly below 1049. I would need to keep more high-value items:\n\n- Adjusting:\n  - 0 units of item 1 (value: 0 \u00d7 36 = 0)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (value: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130)\n  - 6 units of item 3 (value: 6 \u00d7 78 = 468)\n  - 4 units of item 4 (value: 4 \u00d7 42 = 168)\n  - 5 units of item 5 (value: 5 \u00d7 42 = 210)\n\n  Calculation of kept total value:\n  \\(0 + 130 + 468 + 168 + 210 = 976\\).\n\nIt remains challenging to pass 1049 when leveraging significant unit retention. Let's consider one more setup where I keep more:\n\n- Say:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 (value: 1 \u00d7 36 = 36)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (value: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130)\n  - 7 units of item 3 (value: 7 \u00d7 78 = 546) [most valuable]\n  - 4 units of item 4 (value: 4 \u00d7 42 = 168)\n  - 5 units of item 5 (value: 5 \u00d7 42 = 210)\n\nSumming up, my value if I keep:\n  \\(36 + 130 + 546 + 168 + 210 = 1090\\).\n\nThis division yields a total above my outside offer.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 622. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 6, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 0 + 39 x 1 + 95 x 6 + 12 x 1 + 63 x 0\n    which is 621 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 622. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 343. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 591 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 1 + 43 x 1 + 75 x 3 + 6 x 1 + 7 x 0\n    which is 340 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 343. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 0 + 12 x 2 + 83 x 1 + 91 x 0 + 86 x 0\n    which is 107 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 110. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make the best decision, let's follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 922.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 75 per unit\n  - Item 2: 46 per unit\n  - Item 3: 57 per unit\n  - Item 4: 63 per unit\n  - Item 5: 86 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 7 units of Item 1\n  - 1 unit of Item 2\n  - 2 units of Item 3\n  - 4 units of Item 4\n  - 3 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: We currently have no discount applying because it's the first round. Thus, any value I compute for offers should be directly compared to my outside offer of 922.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no initial offer on the table, we need to evaluate potential counteroffers:\n\n- Keeping all items:\n  - Item 1: 7 \u00d7 75 = 525\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 57 = 114\n  - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 63 = 252\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n  - **Total Value** = 1195\n\nFor my counteroffer, I want a total above 922 (my outside offer), whilst ensuring I do not offer excessively:\n\n- Consider keeping more profitable items:\n  - Keep 6 units of Item 1, 0 of Item 2, 1 of Item 3, 3 of Item 4, and 2 of Item 5:\n    - Item 1: 6 \u00d7 75 = 450\n    - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 46 = 0\n    - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 57 = 57\n    - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n    - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n    - **Total Value** = 868 (which is less than 922)\n\nThis is unsatisfactory as it doesn't meet my outside offer value. Let me try again:\n\n- Keep 7 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5:\n  - Item 1: 7 \u00d7 75 = 525\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 46 = 0\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - **Total Value** = 823 (still not acceptable)\n\nContinue adjusting...\n\n- Keep 7 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 1 units of Item 4, 3 units of Item 5:\n  - Item 1: 7 \u00d7 75 = 525\n  - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 46 = 0\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n  - **Total Value** = 846 (again, less than 922)\n\nLet's try another distribution...\n\n- Keep 7 units of Item 1, 1 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 1 units of Item 4, 3 units of Item 5:\n  - Item 1: 7 \u00d7 75 = 525\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n  - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n  - **Total Value** = 892\n\nThis still doesn't reach my outside offer of 922.\n\nGiven these calculations, perhaps reducing unit offers on valuable items might help. \n\nLet's propose a counteroffer:\n\n- Offer: 0 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 1 units of Item 5:\n  - My share for reassurance:\n    - Item 1: 7 \u00d7 75 = 525\n    - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n    - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n    - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n    - **Total Value** = 810\n\nYet again, another rethink:\n\nTo be more decisive, let's attempt a scenario with minimal items:\n\n- Keep 7 units of Item 1, 1 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 4 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5:\n  - Item 1: 7 \u00d7 75 = 525\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n  - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 57 = 0\n  - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 63 = 252\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - **Total Value** = 995\n\nThis combination is the first satisfactory balance above my outside offer value.\n\n### Decision\n\nOffer an initial counteroffer with a value above outside offer value:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]}\n```\n\nHere, I keep a valuable amount of item 1, item 2, and item 4 primarily to ensure my value exceeds 922 while giving a fair amount of certain item units to Player 2 to sustain a negotiable stance.",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 519. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 519. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 705 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 1 + 26 x 1 + 78 x 1 + 29 x 4 + 98 x 3\n    which is 518 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 519. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Hence, accepting it would be a poor choice.\n   - Walking away would guarantee me the value of my outside offer, which is 922.\n   - I need a counteroffer that gives me more than 922 in value after discounting.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer:\n\n- If I keep [6, 1, 0, 3, 3] items, my total value would be:\n  - Item 1: 6 * 75 = 450\n  - Item 2: 1 * 46 = 46\n  - Item 3: 0 * 57 = 0\n  - Item 4: 3 * 63 = 189\n  - Item 5: 3 * 86 = 258\n- Total value = 943\n- Discounted value (round 2) = 943 * 0.9 = 848.7\n- 848.7 is still less than my outside offer, so I need to make sure my offer is better.\n\nLet's try keeping [7, 1, 0, 4, 2]:\n\n- Value calculations:\n  - Item 1: 7 * 75 = 525\n  - Item 2: 1 * 46 = 46\n  - Item 3: 0 * 57 = 0\n  - Item 4: 4 * 63 = 252\n  - Item 5: 2 * 86 = 172\n- Total value = 995\n- Discounted value (round 2) = 995 * 0.9 = 895.5\n\nThis is still not more than 922, but getting very close. Instead, I should adjust items slightly considering distribution:\n\nTry keeping [7, 1, 0, 3, 3]:\n\n- Item 1: 7 * 75 = 525\n- Item 2: 1 * 46 = 46\n- Item 3: 0 * 57 = 0\n- Item 4: 3 * 63 = 189\n- Item 5: 3 * 86 = 258\n- Total value: 1018\n- Discounted value: 1018 * 0.9 = 916.2\n\nThis is less than my outside offer, too but close.\n\n**Conclusively**, I will propose [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] as my counteroffer, which maximizes the item 3 benefit. Let's see how it values:\n\n- Keeping [7, 1, 0, 4, 3]:\n  - Item 1: 7 * (75) = 525\n  - Item 2: 1 * (46) = 46\n  - Item 3: 2 * (57) = 114\n  - Item 4: 4 * (63) = 252\n  - Item 5: 3 * (86) = 258\n\n- Total = 1195 and discount is not better.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 2, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 5 + 75 x 0 + 17 x 2 + 82 x 2 + 12 x 3\n    which is 269 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 270. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 2, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 5 + 75 x 0 + 17 x 2 + 82 x 2 + 12 x 3\n    which is 269 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 270. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 0 + 99 x 1 + 57 x 4 + 3 x 2 + 10 x 4\n    which is 373 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 374.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 769. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 987 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 0, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 3 + 99 x 2 + 89 x 0 + 26 x 6 + 69 x 4\n    which is 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 769. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 2, 0, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 5 + 63 x 2 + 89 x 0 + 14 x 2 + 17 x 5\n    which is 324 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 325.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1013. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1044 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Since 320 is far less than 1013, accepting this offer would not be beneficial.\n\n3) **Assessment of Potential Offers:**\n   - My goal is to come up with an offer where the items I keep have a value above my outside offer of 1013.\n   - Test different reasonable allocations for a counteroffer:\n     - Keep 0 of Item 2, 0 of Item 3, 4 of Item 4, and 3 of Item 5 for myself.

Since it is the first round, this factor does not affect the current valuation of the offer.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer (what I receive): [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n     - Value of 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 85 = 0\n     - Value of 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n     - Value of 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 74 = 0\n     - Value of 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 12 = 0\n     - Value of 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 45 = 0\n     - Total value of current offer = 128\n\n   - Compare the value of the current offer to my outside offer of 459. The current offer (128) is significantly lower than my outside offer, so accepting it would be a mistake.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\n   - Since the value of the current offer (128) is much lower than my outside offer (459), I should not accept the current offer.\n   - I should not walk away either, as this is only the first round, and it's worth attempting to negotiate a more favorable division.\n   - I will propose a counteroffer that ensures the value I receive is greater than 459.\n\nGiven this, let's calculate a counteroffer that yields me a total value greater than 459:\n\nSuppose I propose giving Player 1:\n   - 2 units of item 1\n   - 5 units of item 2\n   - 0 units of item 3\n   - 4 units of item 4\n   - 1 units of item 5\n\n   The items I would keep:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 85 = 255\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n\n   Total value = 255 + 128 + 148 + 24 + 90 = 645\n\nThis counteroffer, where I end up with a value of 645, provides greater value than my outside offer, and it's a reasonable starting point to propose to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 5, 0, 4, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    7 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 70 x 3\n    which is 210 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 211. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Your value would be:\n    87 x 5 + 47 x 2 + 36 x 4 + 71 x 2 + 28 x 3\n    which is 899 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 900. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 2, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide my action, I'll analyze the situation step by step as instructed:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 900.\n   - My values per unit for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 87\n     - Item 2: 47\n     - Item 3: 36\n     - Item 4: 71\n     - Item 5: 28\n   - The total pool of items is [5, 3, 4, 3, 4].\n   - The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the value of the negotiation outcome for this round would be multiplied by \\(0.9^1 = 0.9\\).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Value of the current offer** (which is [3, 2, 2, 0, 3] offered to me):\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 87 = 261\n     - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 47 = 94\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 36 = 72\n     - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 71 = 0\n     - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 28 = 84\n     - Total value = 261 + 94 + 72 + 0 + 84 = 511\n   - Adjusted for the discount factor: 511 \u00d7 0.9 = 459.9\n\n   Since 459.9 is less than my outside offer of 900, accepting the current offer isn't good.\n\n   - **Consider counteroffers giving me higher value (i.e., more than 900 adjusted by discount):**\n     - Let's try an offer that maximizes my value:\n       - Keep: [5, 1, 3, 2, 4] (give [0, 2, 1, 1, 0] to Player 2)\n       - Calculation: \n         - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 87 = 435\n         - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 47 = 47\n         - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 36 = 108\n         - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 71 = 142\n         - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 28 = 112\n         - Total value: 435 + 47 + 108 + 142 + 112 = 844\n       - Adjusted for discount: 844 \u00d7 0.9 = 759.6\n\n   The counteroffer above results in my value being less than my outside offer; therefore, I need a better division to make it worth more than 900, adjusted for the discount, which would be over 1000 pre-discount. \n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nGiven my analysis, the current offer value adjusted for discount (511 \u00d7 0.9 = 459.9) is worse than my outside offer of 900. Moreover, the potential counteroffer calculated still does not yield a higher value than my fallback outside offer when taking the discount factor and the strategic context into account.\n\nThus, I will choose to WALK away to ensure getting my outside offer value of 900.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1048. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 2, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 5 + 89 x 4 + 47 x 2 + 22 x 3 + 70 x 2\n    which is 1046 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1048. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If I offer [1, 3, 2, 2, 1]:\n          - My value:\n            - 5 units of item 1 = 5 * 78 = 390\n            - 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 89 = 178\n            - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 47 = 94\n            - 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 22 = 44\n            - 1 units of item 5 = 1 * 70 = 70\n            \n          - Total value = 390 + 178 + 94 + 44 + 70 = 776\n          - Adjusted for discount: 776 * 0.9 = 698.4\n\n        So, adjusting slowly, I will reveal an offer where I keep 5 units of item 1, 3 units of items 2, 4 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 1 of item 5, and offer the rest. This should ideally meet my threshold requirement.\n\n        So I offer [1, 2, 0, 2, 1] and I keep [5, 3, 4, 2, 1].\n\n        My value:\n          - 5 units of item 1 = 5 * 78 = 390\n          - 3 units of item 2 = 3 * 89 = 267\n          - 4 units of item 3 = 4 * 47 = 188\n          - 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 22 = 44\n          - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 70 = 70\n\n        Total value = 390 + 267 + 188 + 44 + 70 = 959\n        Adjusted for discount: 959 * 0.9 = 863.1\n\n        Given it continues below 1048, let\u2019s try higher trade of items rather than compacting multiple iterations into the round. I present an offer slightly different for better optimization matching its products based from offer history.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n    After assessing my calculations, I determine:\n\n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]}",

Currently in round 2, the discount factor is \\(0.9^{1} = 0.9\\).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer to me: [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n     - My value from accepting this offer:\n       - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n       - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n       - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 61 = 61\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n       - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n       - Total value = 168 + 90 + 61 + 31 + 0 = 350\n     - Considering the discount, the adjusted value is 350 * 0.9 = 315 \n\n   - My outside offer is 619, which is substantially higher than what the current offer provides (315 after discount).\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Since accepting the current offer gives me a value of 315, much lower than my outside offer of 619, accepting it would be a mistake.\n   - Walking away also seems viable since my outside offer is quite strong relative to the discounted value of the current offer.\n   - However, I can still explore making a counteroffer that would maximize my value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1048. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 2, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 5 + 89 x 4 + 47 x 2 + 22 x 3 + 70 x 2\n    which is 1046 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1048. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

Hence, accepting this offer is not a rational decision.\n   - Walking away guarantees me a value of 1048.\n   - As it's the last round, counteroffers from Player 2 are treated as a walk away, so any counteroffer must be appealing to me directly. In this case, maximizing the value through a non-zero count of item 5 to realign some value seems strategic.\n\nConsider offering minimal units for maximum potential self-value:\n\n   - Suppose I propose [4, 4, 3, 3, 1] as a counteroffer. My value would be:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 89 =  89\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 47 =  47\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 22 =  22\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 70 =  70\n     - Total value = 156 + 89 + 47 + 22 + 70 = 384\n\n   However, this value is also less than 1048. Attempting to proceed with a counteroffer yielding less than my fallback isn't rational. \n\nFinal decision: Since no beneficial division surpassing the outside offer of 1048 is feasible, the safest course is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since we are in round 1, there is no discount yet for evaluating offers.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is currently no offer on the table to accept.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I will calculate the value of keeping certain quantities for myself and compare them to my outside offer value of 101.\n\n3) Estimate my possible initial offers:\n   - If I keep all units for myself:\n     - Total value = (2 * 95) + (2 * 64) + (3 * 22) + (4 * 96) + (3 * 24) = 840.\n   - If I offer all to Player 2 (I keep none), my value would be zero. This is worse than my outside offer.\n   - If I offer a reasonable amount to Player 2, I must ensure my remaining value is above 101.\n\nGiven my high valuations for items 1 and 4 compared to other items, I should prioritize keeping most of these items.\n\nI'll propose an initial offer where I keep a significant portion of high-value items and offer some less valued items to Player 2, making sure my total value is higher than 101:\n\nLet's try offering Player 2:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3 (as it's less valuable to me)\n- 2 units of item 4 (trying to keep a fair share)\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis offer means I keep:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nCalculating the values for what I keep:\n- Value from item 1 = 2 * 95 = 190\n- Value from item 2 = 2 * 64 = 128\n- Value from item 4 = 2 * 96 = 192\n- Value from item 5 = 1 * 24 = 24\n- Total value = 534\n\nSince 534 is much greater than my outside offer value of 101, this counteroffer ensures I am receiving more value than the fallback option, while also starting fairly lenient by offering all units of item 3 and sharing prominently from my less valued items.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 2, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 268. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    69 x 0 + 16 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 89 x 3 + 23 x 0\n    which is 267 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 268. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1442. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1442. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 7, 1, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 1 + 58 x 7 + 57 x 1 + 91 x 7 + 67 x 5\n    which is 1439 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1442. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1442. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 831 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 7, 1, 7, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 1 + 58 x 7 + 57 x 1 + 91 x 7 + 67 x 5\n    which is 1439 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1442. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine my action, let's analyze the current situation step-by-step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1442.\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 4 per unit\n  - Item 2: 58 per unit\n  - Item 3: 57 per unit\n  - Item 4: 91 per unit\n  - Item 5: 67 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 7 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 7 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: We are in round 2, so any accepted offer will be multiplied by the discount factor \\( \\gamma = 0.9 \\) to the power of \\( r-1 = 1 \\), meaning the offer's value will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer from Player 2**: [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]\n  - Value of the Offer:\n    - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 58 = 116\n    - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 91 = 91\n    - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 67 = 201\n  - Total Value = 116 + 91 + 201 = 408\n  - Discounted Value in Round 2 = 408 \u00d7 0.9 = 367.2\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**:\n  - Current Offer Value: 367.2\n  - Outside Offer Value: 1442\n  - The current offer is significantly less valuable than my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Decision Making\n\nGiven that the current offer is significantly lower in value compared to my outside offer of 1442, I should not accept it. Walking away is not optimal unless there is no better counteroffer possible. Therefore, I should create a counteroffer that gives me more than 1442 in discounted value.\n\n#### Counteroffer Calculation\n\nTo keep a value near but above my outside offer value, I need an offer where my retained items should give me a value higher when multiplied by the discount factor:\n\nLet's consider keeping:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 6 units\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 6 units\n- Item 5: 5 units\n\nCalculating retained offer value:\n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 4 = 12\n- Item 2: 6 units \u00d7 58 = 348\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 57 = 114\n- Item 4: 6 units \u00d7 91 = 546\n- Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 67 = 335\n\nTotal retained Value = 12 + 348 + 114 + 546 + 335 = 1355\n\nTo keep over my outside offer when discounted:\n1355 \u00d7 0.9 = 1219.5 < 1442\n\nNeed to adjust further: Increase my holding of higher-value item 4 or item 2\n\nLet's keep:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 7 units\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 7 units\n- Item 5: 4 units\n\nRecalculated retained offer value:\n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 4 = 12\n- Item 2: 7 units \u00d7 58 = 406\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 57 = 114\n- Item 4: 7 units \u00d7 91 = 637\n- Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 67 = 268\n\nNew Total= 12 + 406 + 114 + 637 + 268 = 1437\n\nNew discounted value in Round 2: 1437 \u00d7 0.9 = 1293.3\n\nIt's close, but we cannot exceed our offer without holding more of the highest value items. Since this strategy isn't maximizing yet, further balance is needed:\n\nAdjust one last time:\nI'll counter with what is realistically balanced:\n\n- Offering Player 2:\n  - Item 1: 1\n  - Item 2: 0\n  - Item 3: 0\n  - Item 4: 0\n  - Item 5: 1\n\nWhich implies I'm keeping:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 7\n- Item 3: 2\n- Item 4: 7\n- Item 5: 4\n\nRe-recalculated Value:\n- Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n- Item 2: 7 units \u00d7 58 = 406\n- Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 57 = 114\n- Item 4: 7 units \u00d7 91 = 637\n- Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 67 = 268\n\nThis new retained value 8+406+114+637+268 = 1433\n\nFinal discounted value = 1433 \u00d7 0.9 = 1289.7\n\nThus, I am aiming to stick as close to maximum retention without being entirely suboptimal:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 2 + 54 x 4 + 15 x 1 + 61 x 1 + 2 x 1\n    which is 392 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 393. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Therefore, I will proceed with the counteroffer of [3, 2, 0, 2, 2].\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the calculations, I will propose a **COUNTEROFFER** because the current offer from Player 2 does not meet my outside offer value and proposing 3, 2, 0, 2, 2 gives me a better value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 2, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 5 + 73 x 3 + 75 x 2 + 39 x 5 + 51 x 3\n    which is 932 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 936. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - My outside offer value is 550.\n   - My private values per unit for the items are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 12\n     - Item 2: 62\n     - Item 3: 32\n     - Item 4: 32\n     - Item 5: 78\n   - Total pool of items is [5, 7, 2, 3, 2].\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) means the longer the negotiation takes, the less value I'll get from the final deal relative to an immediate outside offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of potential offers:**\n   - Let's evaluate some potential counteroffers. My goal is to claim a value greater than or at least equal to my outside offer of 550.\n\n   I will consider an initial offer where I keep a significant portion of my most valuable items while evaluating different allocations.\n\n   Let's calculate my total value for a potential allocation:\n   \n   - Offer to keep [3, 2, 1, 1, 0] for myself and offer [2, 5, 1, 2, 2] to Player 2:\n     - Total value to me:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 78 = 0\n     - Total value = 36 + 124 + 32 + 32 = 224\n\n   This offer would have a low total value for me (224), which is far below my outside offer of 550. Therefore, it is not acceptable.\n\n   Let's try a more conservative distribution where I focus on keeping more of the high-value items (item 5 in this case):\n\n   - Offer to keep [2, 2, 1, 1, 1] for myself and offer [3, 5, 1, 2, 1] to Player 2:\n     - Total value to me:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 78 = 78\n     - Total value = 24 + 124 + 32 + 32 + 78 = 290\n\n   Again, this does not meet my outside offer value.\n\n3) **Conclusion:**\n   Neither of the allocations considered meet or exceed my outside offer value.\n\nGiven these constraints, my strategy should be to offer a distribution that maximizes my value, while being aware that it is round 1, and Player 2 might counter or accept an offer closer to my highest valued items. I should attempt an offer where my value is maximized to be close to my outside offer, while maintaining a reasonable allocation:\n\n- Offer to keep [1, 2, 0, 1, 2] for myself and offer [4, 5, 2, 2, 0] to Player 2:\n\n   - Total value to me:\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 78 = 156\n   - Total value = 12 + 124 + 0 + 32 + 156 = 324\n\nThis value is still less than my outside offer, but given my alternative options examined, let's use it as an initial negotiation starter and adjust in subsequent rounds.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 5, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 20. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 561 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    61 x 0 + 13 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 63 x 0 + 7 x 2\n    which is 14 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 20. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 5, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 5, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1016. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1016. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 7, 2, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 3 + 39 x 4 + 59 x 7 + 36 x 2 + 20 x 7\n    which is 1015 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1016. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1016.\n   - My values for the items involved are:\n     - Item 1: 78\n     - Item 2: 39\n     - Item 3: 59\n     - Item 4: 36\n     - Item 5: 20\n   - The total pool of items available are:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 7 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 7 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) influences any delay in reaching an agreement, as the value would decrease by a factor of gamma per round.\n\n2) Assess the value of potential counteroffers:\n   Since there are no offers on the table, I must generate a counteroffer that will maximize my value, ensuring it is higher than my outside offer. \n\n   To maximize my own value from these items, I will consider giving away fewer units of high-value items and more of low-value items. \n\n   Here's a potential distribution to consider:\n   - Offer Player 2: [0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5]\n\n   Calculating my value for the remaining items:\n   - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n   - 7 units of item 3 = 7 \u00d7 59 = 413\n   - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n   - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n\n   Total value = 234 + 156 + 413 = 803\n\n   I can see that this value (803) is less than my outside offer (1016).

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 357. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 540 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 2, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 5 + 24 x 4 + 36 x 2 + 81 x 0 + 12 x 4\n    which is 351 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 357. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 7, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 7, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 1 + 80 x 2 + 10 x 2 + 82 x 3 + 43 x 4\n    which is 670 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 671. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 4, 0, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, in this first round, there's no discount applied yet, but delaying decisions should consider the reduced value in future rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer on the table to accept.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I should aim to keep items that maximize my value above my outside offer. I can calculate the total value for keeping different combinations but focus on maximizing the overall value while giving away less valued items.\n\nLet's begin by evaluating an example offer and iterating until the value I keep is greater than my outside offer:\n\n- Example counteroffer to consider: \n   - Offer Player 2: [3, 4, 1, 0, 0]\n   - I keep: [0, 1, 5, 3, 2]\n\n   Calculate the value of the items I keep: \n   - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 37 = 0\n   - 1 units of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n   - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 61 = 305\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n   Total value = 12 + 305 + 153 + 196 = 666\n\nThis total value (666) is less than my outside offer of 693. I should adjust my offer to increase my retained value. Let's aim for retaining more valuable items:\n\n- Revised Counteroffer:\n  - Offer Player 2: [3, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n  - I keep: [0, 1, 6, 3, 2]\n   \n  Calculate the value of the items I keep:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 37 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n  - 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 61 = 366\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n  Total value = 12 + 366 + 153 + 196 = 727\n\nThis total value (727) exceeds my outside offer of 693, which makes this a viable counteroffer. \n\n3) Decision:\nAs the value is greater than my outside offer, I will proceed with the counteroffer to maximize my outcomes in this negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This is the third and final round, so the discount factor doesn't apply to potential future rounds, only to the current round (discount factor of 0.9\u00b2 for acceptance).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:** \n   - Current offer (offer from Player 2): [0, 4, 2, 0, 0]\n     - Value to me if accepted:\n       - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 37 = 0\n       - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 12 = 48\n       - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 61 = 122\n       - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 51 = 0\n       - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 98 = 0\n     - Total value = 48 + 122 = 170\n     - Adjusted for discount factor = 0.9^2 \u00d7 170 = 137.7\n   - Compare with outside offer value = 693\n   - Potential counteroffer valuations need to exceed 693 to be considered.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer\u2019s actual value (137.7) is significantly less than my outside offer value (693).\n   - As it is the third and final round, any counteroffer by Player 2 would be treated as a walk; so if I make a counteroffer, I need to ensure it is beneficial or equivalent to the outside offer.\n   - Since my total value for all items is considerably above 693, an effective distribution where I receive items valued above 693 considering the other values/items is most strategic.\n   - A fair offer would ensure I can value it above 693 considering all possible discounts.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy, given the above, is to **WALK**, because no current offer or feasible counteroffer at this point would guarantee a higher value than my outside offer, considering discount effects and no further rounds in negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 52 x 3 + 47 x 0 + 36 x 2 + 95 x 4\n    which is 608 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 609. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

It is essential to ensure the value I secure for myself is above my outside offer of 609.\n\n   My strategy is to calculate what I should keep for a value greater than 609 and offer the rest.\n\n   Proposal considerations:\n   \n   - Keep maximum value items (item 5 and item 2) mostly to myself as they contribute a lot to my total value.\n   - Try to understand comparatively lower valued units for me but that may be highly valuable for Player 2.\n\n   Now let's determine a possible distribution:\n   For a trial calculation, I keep:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 (1 \u00d7 9 = 9)\n   - 3 units of item 2 (3 \u00d7 52 = 156)\n   - 0 units of item 3\n   - 4 units of item 4 (4 \u00d7 36 = 144)\n   - 7 units of item 5 (7 \u00d7 95 = 665)\n\n   Calculating the resultant value for me: 9 + 156 + 0 + 144 + 665 = 974\n\n3) Since 974 is considerably above my outside offer of 609, I want to propose this counteroffer as my initial offer to Player 2:\n\nI offer the following to Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer.

Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    9 x 0 + 52 x 3 + 47 x 0 + 36 x 2 + 95 x 4\n    which is 608 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 609. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

Since this is round 3, the discount factor is not applied anymore as it's the last possible round of negotiation, making timing a non-issue now.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer**: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], which means I receive 4 of item 4 and nothing else.\n     - My value if I accept this offer: 4 units of item 4 * 36 = 144.\n     - 144 is clearly lower than my outside offer of 609. Hence, accepting is not advantageous.\n   - **Compare to Potential Counteroffers**:\n     - Instead, let me calculate the value for one possible counteroffer where I maximize value more:\n       - Offer [2, 1, 0, 3, 1] to Player 2, meaning I keep [0, 6, 0, 3, 7]:\n         - My value: \n           - item 1: 0 * 9 = 0\n           - item 2: 6 * 52 = 312\n           - item 3: 0 * 47 = 0\n           - item 4: 3 * 36 = 108\n           - item 5: 7 * 95 = 665\n         - Total value = 1085, which is well above 609.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n   - Since accepting the current offer yields only 144, far below my outside offer, I should not accept it.\n   - The counteroffer proposal where I keep [0, 6, 0, 3, 7] yields a value of 1085, much better than the outside offer.\n   - I will propose the counteroffer.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 3, 1]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 7, 0, 0, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 2 + 54 x 7 + 27 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 91 x 8\n    which is 1174 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1175. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 2, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 1 + 75 x 4 + 61 x 2 + 20 x 5 + 14 x 3\n    which is 574 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 575. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, this offer doesn't work.\n\n  Another attempt:\n  - Offering Player 1 [0, 2, 1, 1, 0] (i.e., I keep [3, 2, 3, 4, 3])\n    - Value of items I keep:\n      - Item 1: 3 x 10 = 30\n      - Item 2: 2 x 75 = 150\n      - Item 3: 3 x 61 = 183\n      - Item 4: 4 x 20 = 80\n      - Item 5: 3 x 14 = 42\n    - Total value with this offer is exactly 485, still less than my outside offer.\n\n  Final attempt:\n  - Offering Player 1 [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] (i.e., I keep [3, 2, 3, 5, 3])\n    - Value of items I keep:\n      - Item 1: 3 x 10 = 30\n      - Item 2: 2 x 75 = 150\n      - Item 3: 3 x 61 = 183\n      - Item 4: 5 x 20 = 100\n      - Item 5: 3 x 14 = 42\n    - Total value with this offer is 505, still less than my outside offer.\n\nNone of these counteroffers suffice because none exceed my outside offer of 575.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 1 + 80 x 0 + 45 x 1 + 42 x 0 + 43 x 1\n    which is 94 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 96. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 52 x 1 + 95 x 2 + 49 x 1 + 62 x 1\n    which is 353 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 354. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 31 x 1 + 4 x 5 + 56 x 0 + 64 x 0\n    which is 51 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 53. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's go through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 1841.\n   - My values for each item are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 59 per unit\n     - Item 2: 34 per unit\n     - Item 3: 83 per unit\n     - Item 4: 97 per unit\n     - Item 5: 88 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - Item 1: 9 units\n     - Item 2: 5 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 5 units\n     - Item 5: 5 units\n   - The discount factor influences the value of accepting current offers versus future offers as the value will be multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} \\).\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Currently, there is no offer on the table from Player 2.\n   - I need to calculate potential value from keeping certain items for myself and offering others to Player 2.\n\n3) Make an initial strategic decision:\n   \n   To maximize value for myself, I will aim to keep as many high-value items as possible while providing a reasonable offer to Player 2. Given my outside offer is 1841, any counteroffer should ensure my portion of the items equals or exceeds this value.\n\n   Let's consider proposing to keep most of the items for myself to see if I can maximize my value:\n\n   - Offer Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], meaning I keep 9 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. Calculate my total value:\n     - Value from item 1: 9 * 59 = 531\n     - Value from item 2: 4 * 34 = 136\n     - Value from item 3: 3 * 83 = 249\n     - Value from item 4: 5 * 97 = 485\n     - Value from item 5: 5 * 88 = 440\n     - Total value = 531 + 136 + 249 + 485 + 440 = 1841\n\n   This counteroffer will have a total value of 1841, exactly matching my outside offer. I will need to try maximizing the value I gain further by giving a minimal beneficial offer to Player 2 by changing the one item I am offering.\n\n   - Instead, let's try offering Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], keeping 9 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5 for myself. Calculate again:\n     - Value from item 1: 9 * 59 = 531\n     - Value from item 2: 5 * 34 = 170\n     - Value from item 3: 3 * 83 = 249\n     - Value from item 4: 5 * 97 = 485\n     - Value from item 5: 4 * 88 = 352\n     - Total value = 531 + 170 + 249 + 485 + 352 = 1787\n\n   With this adjustment, it's less than my outside offer, so I need to aim better:\n\n   Let's try offering Player 2 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]:\n\n   - Keeping 8 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5:\n     - Value from item 1: 8 * 59 = 472\n     - Value from item 2: 5 * 34 = 170\n     - Value from item 3: 2 * 83 = 166\n     - Value from item 4: 5 * 97 = 485\n     - Value from item 5: 4 * 88 = 352\n     - Total value = 472 + 170 + 166 + 485 + 352 = 1645\n\n   This value is still not reaching my outside offer, so let's try reducing one high-value item unit given away:\n\n   Adjust to [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]:\n\n   - Keeping 8 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5:\n     - Value from item 1: 8 * 59 = 472\n     - Value from item 2: 5 * 34 = 170\n     - Value from item 3: 3 * 83 = 249\n     - Value from item 4: 5 * 97 = 485\n     - Value from item 5: 4 * 88 = 352\n     - Total value = 472 + 170 + 249 + 485 + 352 = 1728\n\n   Working systematically from this reasoning, offering Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] may achieve a relatively favorable starting baseline. I will adjust from here if necessary. This attempt maintains minimizing any mistakes highlighted and aligns with immediate goals.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 997. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 997. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 0, 3, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 7 + 19 x 0 + 39 x 3 + 2 x 1 + 62 x 5\n    which is 996 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 997. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1026. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1026. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 4, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 2 + 77 x 3 + 36 x 4 + 84 x 5 + 22 x 4\n    which is 1023 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1026. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To begin, let's analyze the current situation:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1026.\n   - My values per unit for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 70\n     - Item 2: 77\n     - Item 3: 36\n     - Item 4: 84\n     - Item 5: 22\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor does not apply to my decision now since it's about the present value first, but it would in future rounds if negotiations continue.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to consider accepting at this moment.\n   - For a potential counteroffer, I need to propose an initial division of items that ensures I get a total value higher than 1026. It means offering less than 49 units of item value to ensure that what I retain exceeds 1026.\n\n3) **Determine a Valid Offer:**\n   - To avoid offering too much, I can start with a proposal letting Player 2 have less valuable items or fewer total units than my outside offer worth:\n     - Offering Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 5]\n       - Item 1 (1 unit): Worth 70 \u2192 I keep 1, I get 70\n       - Item 2 (1 unit): Worth 77 \u2192 I keep 2, I get 154\n       - Item 3 (1 unit): Worth 36 \u2192 I keep 4, I get 144\n       - Item 4 (1 unit): Worth 84 \u2192 I keep 4, I get 336\n       - Item 5 (5 units): Worth 22 \u2192 I keep 0, I get 0\n   - Total value of my offer: 70 + 154 + 144 + 336 + 0 = 704\n\nSince this value (704) does not exceed my outside offer value (1026), my offer needs to be adjusted to retain more items or items of higher value:\n\nAnother option is:\n   - Offering Player 2: [0, 0, 3, 2, 5]\n     - Item 1 (0 units): Keep all 140\n     - Item 2 (0 units): Keep all 231\n     - Item 3 (3 units): Keep 2 units worth 72\n     - Item 4 (3 units): Keep 3 units worth 252\n     - Item 5 (0 units): Keep all 0\n   - Total value I receive: 140 + 231 + 72 + 252 + 0 = 695\n   - Offer adjusted accordingly.\n\nSince neither satisfies my outside offer, another adjustment is needed:\nLast attempt:\n   - Offering Player 2: [0, 2, 3, 5, 2]\n     - Item 1 (0 units): Keep all 140\n     - Item 2 (1 units): Keep 1 unit worth 77\n     - Item 3 (2 units): Keep 2 units worth 72\n     - Item 4 (0 units): Keep all 420\n     - Item 5 (2 units): Keep 3 units worth 66\n   - Total value I receive: 140 + 77 + 72 + 420 + 66 = 775\n\nAdjust to make a valid high offer aimed at just hitting my outside offer value:\n   - Offering Player 2: [0, 0, 2, 3, 5]\n   - Total value: 140 + 231 + 72 + 168 + 0 = 611 \n\nThe calculations aren't providing a feasible counteroffer greater than 1026. I again adjust.\n\n4) **Action:**\n   After attempts to reconcile mistakes with my goal of 1026, standard feasible counteroffers don't meet criteria. At a closer review, I'll choose:\n    \n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's follow the step-by-step evaluation:\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 371.\n   - My values for items are:\n     - Item 1: 43\n     - Item 2: 68\n     - Item 3: 38\n     - Item 4: 7\n     - Item 5: 69\n   - The total pool of items are: 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. This will become relevant if the negotiation proceeds to multiple rounds.\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n   - The current offer to me is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n     - Value if I accept the current offer:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 43 = 43\n       - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 68 = 68\n       - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 38 = 38\n       - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n       - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 69 = 69\n       - Total = 43 + 68 + 38 + 7 + 69 = 225\n   - The value of the current offer (225) is less than my outside offer value (371).\n\n3) Making a decision:\n   - Accepting the current offer would result in a total value of 225, which is less than my outside offer of 371. Therefore, following mistake 4, I should NOT accept this offer.\n   - Walking away right now would guarantee me 371, which is better than the current offer.\n   - Should propose a counteroffer that results in a value greater than 371 for me.\n\nLet's calculate a possible advantageous counteroffer:\n\n- Let's consider keeping as much of the higher-value items as possible. Specifically, valuable items for me are item 5 and item 2. I should attempt to retain more units of these items.\n\nFor instance, I could offer Player 1: [0, 1, 1, 5, 0]\nThis allows me to keep [3, 0, 1, 1, 3]\n\n- Value for this counteroffer:\n  - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 43 = 129\n  - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 68 = 0\n  - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 38 = 38\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 69 = 207\n  - Total = 129 + 0 + 38 + 7 + 207 = 381\n\nThe value of this counteroffer (381) is slightly higher than my outside offer (371).\n\nTherefore, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 5, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 267. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 324 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 2, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 3 + 19 x 0 + 4 x 2 + 17 x 5 + 31 x 2\n    which is 266 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 267. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n1) Current Situation Analysis:\n   - My outside offer value: 267\n   - Values of the items to me:\n      - Item 1: 37\n      - Item 2: 19\n      - Item 3: 4\n      - Item 4: 17\n      - Item 5: 31\n   - Total pool of items: [3, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n   - Discount factor: As it's round 2, $\\gamma^1 = 0.9$ will reduce the effective value slightly compared to round 1.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer gives me [0, 1, 1, 5, 0] which I value as follows:\n       - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 37 = 0\n       - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n       - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n       - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 17 = 85\n       - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 31 = 0\n       - Total value = 0 + 19 + 4 + 85 + 0 = 108\n   - Adjusted value with discount in round 2 = 108 \u00d7 0.9 = 97.2\n\n   The current offer value (97.2) is significantly less than my outside offer value (267).\n\n   For a potential counteroffer, I need to ensure the kept items are valued at least at 267, ignoring the discount for simplicity in my planning:\n\n   Suppose I keep [3, 0, 2, 3, 3] items. The value would be:\n   - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n   - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n   - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n   - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n   - Total value = 111 + 0 + 8 + 51 + 93 = 263\n\n   So if I propose [0, 1, 0, 3, 0], my value is just shy of my outside offer (263 versus 267). I should try to adjust to get at least 267.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - Since accepting the current offer would yield a value lower than my outside offer and based on my counteroffer evaluation, I should propose a counteroffer aiming for at least a total value of 267.\n\n   I will propose keeping [3, 1, 1, 3, 2], offering Player 2 [0, 0, 1, 3, 1]. Let's verify this:\n   - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n   - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n   - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n   - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n   - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n   - Total value = 111 + 19 + 4 + 51 + 62 = 247\n\nEven with this, the value is not meeting 267 due to limited flexibility. I must think creatively.\n\nI'll change the offer slightly: give up one more item 1, and aim for 3 on item 4:\n\nI'll counteroffer with [1, 0, 1, 3, 0]. Let's check its value:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n- Item 3: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n- Total value = 74 + 19 + 4 + 51 + 93 = 241\n\nThis is tricky due to unaimed values. Let's try final offer [0, 1, 1, 4, 0]:\n- Item 1: 0 x 37 = 0\n- Item 3: 3 x 31 = 93\n- Item 4: 2 x 31 = 62\nMy thorough check blocked all distracting figures. So, without scope further, the best choice might to \n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's analyze the current situation:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - My outside offer value is 572.\n   - My private item values are: \n     - Item 1: 54\n     - Item 2: 16\n     - Item 3: 56\n     - Item 4: 51\n     - Item 5: 84\n   - The total pool of items consists of:\n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma) of 0.9 will decrease the value of a deal each round by 10%, but since it's round 1, this doesn't apply right now.\n\n2) **Potential Offers Analysis:**\n   - I need to ensure any counteroffer I make gives me more value than my outside offer of 572.\n   - To determine this, I can try to maximize my total value from my private valuation of these items.\n\nLet's consider keeping all units of the items and seeing how it adds up to maximize my value:\n   - Total value of my items:\n     - 3 units of item 1 \u00d7 54 = 162\n     - 4 units of item 2 \u00d7 16 = 64\n     - 3 units of item 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n     - 2 units of item 4 \u00d7 51 = 102\n     - 6 units of item 5 \u00d7 84 = 504\n     - Total value = 1000\n\nSince the total value of all items is 1000, I should look to hold onto a portion of items that maximizes my value to at least surpass my outside offer of 572. \n\nLet's check a potential counteroffer dividing items where I hold a high-value section:\n   - Keep all units of item 5 since it has the highest value and some of item 3 or item 1.\n   - Example attempt:\n      - I keep 0 of item 1 (offering 3), 4 units of item 2 (offering 0), 0 of item 3 (offering 3), 0 of item 4 (offering 2), and 6 of item 5 (offering 0).\n     - Valuation:\n       - 0 \u00d7 54 = 0 for item 1\n       - 4 \u00d7 16 = 64 for item 2\n       - 0 \u00d7 56 = 0 for item 3\n       - 0 \u00d7 51 = 0 for item 4\n       - 6 \u00d7 84 = 504 for item 5\n     - Total value = 64 + 504 = 568\n   \nThis offer is still below my outside offer. Let us adjust by keeping item 5 and some other high-valued combinations:\n   - Example Offer:\n     - Offer opponent: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n     - My holdings become: 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\n     - Valuation:\n       - 0 \u00d7 54 = 0 for item 1\n       - 0 \u00d7 16 = 0 for item 2\n       - 0 \u00d7 56 = 0 for item 3\n       - 2 \u00d7 51 = 102 for item 4\n       - 2 \u00d7 84 = 168 for item 5\n     - Total value = 102 + 168 = 270. Clearly inadequate, even adjusting.\n\nMore iterations will eventually be necessary to hit above 572 but in a fair, first-balanced proposal more tailored using top distributions like:\nAttempt alternative:\n    - Proposal: Offer opponent: 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, 0 of item 5.\n    - My holdings: 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 6 of item 5.\n    - Valuation:\n      - 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 for item 1\n      - 1 \u00d7 16 = 16 for item 2\n      - 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 for item 3\n      - 2 \u00d7 51 = 102 for item 4\n      - 6 \u00d7 84 = 504 for item 5\n    - Total value = 952, Surpassing my outside offer clearly.\n\n   Hence, a counteroffer which must strategically hold significant item 5 values to cater surpassing remaining low unit-remaining items like:\n     - Provide a rational counteracting with units blocking of critical valuations like item 1 and item 3 prominent but leveraging small units at item 2.\n\n**Decision:** I should make a COUNTEROFFER that gives away item 2 while retaining the most valuable ones, capturing majority significant items. Hence, find the following offer confirmation to proceed beyond valuations thresholds including proposal limits:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 237. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 237. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 3 x 2 + 78 x 1 + 38 x 4\n    which is 236 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 237. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I'll try again.\n\nSuppose I retain [0, 4, 2, 4, 2], and offer [2, 0, 2, 0, 0] to Player 2. Now, my value is:\n- Item 1: 0 x 14 = 0\n- Item 2: 4 x 88 = 352\n- Item 3: 2 x 15 = 30\n- Item 4: 4 x 54 = 216\n- Item 5: 2 x 7 = 14\n\nTotal value = 0 + 352 + 30 + 216 + 14 = 612\n\n612 is also less than 646. Thus, I need to re-evaluate.\n\nI will now try keeping more of the high-valued item 2 since that provides the most value per unit:\nSuppose I retain [0, 4, 4, 3, 0], and offer [2, 0, 0, 1, 2] to Player 2. My value is:\n- Item 1: 0 x 14 = 0\n- Item 2: 4 x 88 = 352\n- Item 3: 4 x 15 = 60\n- Item 4: 3 x 54 = 162\n- Item 5: 0 x 7 = 0\n\nTotal value = 0 + 352 + 60 + 162 + 0 = 574\n\nThis is still insufficient, so let's adjust further to maximize value over my outside offer.\n\nFinally, I try retaining [0, 4, 4, 4, 2]. Offering [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] ensures my value is:\n- Item 1: 0 x 14 = 0\n- Item 2: 4 x 88 = 352\n- Item 3: 4 x 15 = 60\n- Item 4: 4 x 54 = 216\n- Item 5: 2 x 7 = 14\n\nTotal value = 0 + 352 + 60 + 216 + 14 = 642\n\nThis attempt gets close but still fails to meet the outside offer value of 646. I need to adjust by ensuring more of item 2 is retained.\n\nAfter further adjustment, retaining [0, 3, 4, 4, 2] should provide:\n- Item 1: 0 x 14 = 0\n- Item 2: 3 x 88 = 264\n- Item 3: 4 x 15 = 60\n- Item 4: 4 x 54 = 216\n- Item 5: 2 x 7 = 14\n\nThis configuration exactly equals a value of 646. Offering the balance to Player 2 is:\n\n- Offer: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]}",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 0 + 46 x 2 + 42 x 0 + 94 x 2 + 35 x 0\n    which is 280 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 281. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 646. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 534 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 728. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 728. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 948 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 1, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 1 + 79 x 4 + 45 x 1 + 59 x 1 + 58 x 4\n    which is 727 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 728. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's go through the steps:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 728\n   - Values of the items involved: \n     - Item 1: 75 \n     - Item 2: 79\n     - Item 3: 45\n     - Item 4: 59\n     - Item 5: 58\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: Not directly relevant at this stage since we are in the first round. However, future values will be discounted, so ensure current or better offers are considered.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - For the current offer [2, 3, 2, 1, 2] (what I receive):\n     - Value = (2 x 75) + (3 x 79) + (2 x 45) + (1 x 59) + (2 x 58)\n     - Value = 150 + 237 + 90 + 59 + 116 = 652\n\n   Since 652 is less than my outside offer of 728, accepting this offer would be worse than my fallback option, so I should not accept this current offer.\n\n   - Evaluate potential counteroffers:\n     - I need to keep items such that my value exceeds 728. A possible distribution to consider could be maximizing valuable items like Item 2 and Item 1 due to their higher values.\n\n     Consider a possible counteroffer where:\n     - [keeping 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 3 of item 5] for myself and offering the rest to Player 1: [2, 3, 3, 1, 2]\n     - My value would be: \n       - Value = (1 x 75) + (1 x 79) + (3 x 45) + (1 x 59) + (3 x 58)\n       - Value = 75 + 79 + 135 + 59 + 174 = 522 (this is still low)\n\n     Let's adjust to focus on keeping more of the higher valued items, recalculating and aiming for better than 728.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Instead of the previous misstep, calculate again for better alternatives focusing on keeping more valuable items.\n\n   Let me try keeping [1, 1, 4, 2, 3], thus offering [2, 3, 2, 0, 2].\n   - My value would be:\n     - Value = (1 x 75) + (1 x 79) + (4 x 45) + (2 x 59) + (3 x 58)\n     - Value = 75 + 79 + 180 + 118 + 174 = 626\n\nSince none of these provide acceptable alternatives yet, adjustments must be made to aim for better than 728. Let\u2019s re-calculate for a better offer to Player 1 giving them less of the valuable items:\n\n   Keep: [0, 0, 6, 2, 3], offering [3, 4, 0, 0, 2], let\u2019s check:\n   - My value would be:\n     - Value = (0 x 75) + (0 x 79) + (6 x 45) + (2 x 59) + (3 x 58)\n     - Value = 0 + 0 + 270 + 118 + 174 = 562\n\nThis is still lower. I need to optimize the items better to increase my result above 728 by perhaps preserving more of items 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, re-evaluate strategy for the next suitable offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 1, 0]}",

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the current situation in detail:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 955.\n\n   - **Values of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 18\n     - Item 2: 67\n     - Item 3: 7\n     - Item 4: 75\n     - Item 5: 5\n   \n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 9 units of item 4\n     - 9 units of item 5\n\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor of 0.9 means that any agreements reached in subsequent rounds will be worth less, indicating a higher value gained from realizing a favorable settlement sooner rather than later.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\nSince there is no current offer from Player 2, I'll evaluate potential counteroffers I could make and their associated values.\n\n   - **Counteroffer Example:**\n     - Offering Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 4, 5] means I keep:\n       - 4 units of item 1 = 72 (4x18)\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 201 (3x67)\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 14 (2x7)\n       - 5 units of item 4 = 375 (5x75)\n       - 4 units of item 5 = 20 (4x5)\n     - Total value for me: 682\n\nThis offer results in a personal value of 682, which is less than my outside value offer of 955. Hence, I must optimize further.\n\nLet's try a different allocation that might yield a higher value:\n\n   - **Counteroffer Adjustment:**\n     - Offering Player 2: [1, 1, 1, 3, 4] means I keep:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 54 (3x18)\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 134 (2x67)\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 7 (1x7)\n       - 6 units of item 4 = 450 (6x75)\n       - 5 units of item 5 = 25 (5x5)\n     - Total value for me: 670\n\nThis modified offer results in a total value of 670, still less than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\nGiven the requirement to find a proposal more favorable than my outside option, let's attempt the following:\n\n   - **Optimized Counteroffer:**\n     - Offering Player 2: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] means I keep:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 54 (3x18)\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 201 (3x67)\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 14 (2x7)\n       - 8 units of item 4 = 600 (8x75)\n       - 9 units of item 5 = 45 (9x5)\n     - Total value for me: 914\n\nEven this higher retention of value results in 914, which is still less than 955.\n\nAfter iterative attempts, crafting an optimal offer securing more than 955 confirms infeasibility without insights into Player 2's value priorities. Therefore, proposing an equal division to allow dialogue initiation affords a reserved degree of strategic adaptation in succeeding rounds.\n\n- **Proposed Counteroffer (New Attempt):**\n  Offering Player 2 a negligible quantity but stimulating negotiation with realistic equity: [0, 1, 0, 6, 4] provides me:\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 72\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 134\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 14\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 225 \n  - 5 units of item 5 = 25\n  - Total = 470\n\nEven minimal offers satisfy the attempt, engaging Player 2 acceptably - reflective of my control.\n\nThus, I will propose a counteroffer prioritizing my high-value items:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 4, 9]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 189. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 930 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 1 + 63 x 0 + 69 x 2 + 68 x 0 + 68 x 0\n    which is 180 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 189. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 571. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 897 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 2, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 4 + 43 x 0 + 47 x 2 + 21 x 4 + 90 x 0\n    which is 570 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 571. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 3, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 1, 3, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value:** 95\n- **Values of the items:** \n  - Item 1: 56\n  - Item 2: 86\n  - Item 3: 45\n  - Item 4: 75\n  - Item 5: 27\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 7 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n- **Discount factor:** The discount factor of 0.9 affects future negotiations, making current rounds potentially more valuable.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer [0, 4, 0, 1, 0] (what I receive):**\n  - Value of 0 units of item 1: 0 x 56 = 0\n  - Value of 4 units of item 2: 4 x 86 = 344\n  - Value of 0 units of item 3: 0 x 45 = 0\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 4: 1 x 75 = 75\n  - Value of 0 units of item 5: 0 x 27 = 0\n  - Total value = 0 + 344 + 0 + 75 + 0 = 419\n\nSince 419 is clearly above my outside offer of 95, this offer is better than walking away immediately. However, let's consider if there's an option to further maximize my gain by counteroffering.\n\n### Step 3: Consider a Counteroffer\n\nI can attempt to construct a counteroffer that enhances my value beyond 419. A counteroffer should:\n\n- Avoid any mistakes like making the offer worse for myself or lower than the outside offer.\n- Aim for a strategic division where I slightly adjust the distribution to gain more value.\n\nConsidering the high value I get from items 2 and 4 compared to the rest, and Player 1 not offering any units of item 3 (potentially indicating lower value for them), I might attempt to increase the allocation of items that are valuable to me without risking the negotiation.\n\nPotential counteroffer (what I propose to give to Player 1):\n- Offer Player 1 more item 1 units (from 0 to 2), and item 4 (reduce my pending offer for their value effect), but keep item 2 fully, which is high-valued for me.\n\n- Counteroffer: [2, 0, 0, 3, 2]\n\nCalculate my value if I keep:\n- Items I propose to keep: [0, 4, 7, 1, 0]\n- Recalculating the value:\n  - Value of 0 units of item 1: 0\n  - Value of 4 units of item 2: 4 x 86 = 344\n  - Value of 7 units of item 3: 7 x 45 = 315\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 4: 1 x 75 = 75\n  - Value of 0 units of item 5: 0\n  - Total value = 0 + 344 + 315 + 75 + 0 = 734\n\n734 is a comfortable buffer and a significant improvement over the initial offer.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that my current offer acceptance yields 419, and my proposed arrangement significantly increases the yield, it makes strategic sense to offer a counter.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 3, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 872. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 5, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 1 + 52 x 4 + 76 x 5 + 58 x 2 + 76 x 2\n    which is 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 872. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's go over the necessary analysis:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** 872\n   - **Values of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 14\n     - Item 2: 52\n     - Item 3: 76\n     - Item 4: 58\n     - Item 5: 76\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 4 units\n     - Item 3: 7 units\n     - Item 4: 4 units\n     - Item 5: 2 units\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** We are now in round 2, so any value of an outcome is multiplied by \\(0.9^{(2-1)} = 0.9\\).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer (to you):** [2, 0, 0, 3, 2]\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 52 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 76 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n     - Total Value = 28 + 0 + 0 + 174 + 152 = 354\n     - Discounted Value = 354 \u00d7 0.9 = 318.6\n\n   The current offer provides a value of 318.6, which is significantly less than your outside offer of 872.\n\n   - **Counteroffers Examination:** Need to find a counteroffer exceeding value 872 to be better than the outside offer.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1182. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1005 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 5, 3, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 0 + 40 x 2 + 95 x 5 + 32 x 3 + 88 x 6\n    which is 1179 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1182. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine my action, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 653.\n   - My values per unit of each item: \n     - Item 1: 70\n     - Item 2: 52 (Note: There are no units of item 2)\n     - Item 3: 70\n     - Item 4: 64\n     - Item 5: 99\n   - Total pool of items: 7 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5.\n   - Discount factor (gamma): In round 1, it's effectively 1, as no rounds have been lost yet.\n\n2) Assessing the value of potential offers:\n   - I need to create a counteroffer where my retained items have a value greater than 653.\n   - If I keep all units, my value is:\n     - Item 1: 7 * 70 = 490\n     - Item 3: 2 * 70 = 140\n     - Item 4: 3 * 64 = 192\n     - Item 5: 7 * 99 = 693\n     - Total = 490 + 140 + 192 + 693 = 1515\n\nHowever, I must ensure my proposed division does not make the mistake of offering a division worse than my outside offer. The offer must be structured so that my remaining items have a total value exceeding 653.\n\nLet's evaluate a potential counteroffer:\n\n- Suppose I offer Player 2: [3, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n  - My retained items would be: [4, 0, 2, 2, 3]\n  - Value to me:\n    - 4 units of item 1: 4 * 70 = 280\n    - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 70 = 140\n    - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 64 = 128\n    - 3 units of item 5: 3 * 99 = 297\n    - Total = 280 + 140 + 128 + 297 = 845\n\nSince 845 is greater than my outside offer of 653, this counteroffer is more advantageous than walking away. Additionally, the value should encourage Player 2 to consider counter-negotiation without me sacrificing my minimum value requirement.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - I will propose this counteroffer to Player 2, ensuring my strategy maximizes my value while allowing negotiations to proceed.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 1, 4]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1032. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1032. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 0, 2, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 7 + 23 x 0 + 30 x 2 + 86 x 0 + 80 x 6\n    which is 1030 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1032. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine my action, let's go through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** 841\n   - **Values of the items (per unit):** \n     - Item 1: 37\n     - Item 2: 94\n     - Item 3: 37\n     - Item 4: 7\n     - Item 5: 50\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - 5 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 8 units of item 3\n     - 7 units of item 4\n     - 8 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor:** 0.9. Being round 2, the value of accepting a deal is multiplied by \\(0.9^{1}\\) which equals 0.9, so the value of any deal this round is 90% of the calculated item value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer ([1, 2, 3, 5, 2]):**\n     - Value of receiving 1 unit of item 1: \\(1 \\times 37 = 37\\)\n     - Value of receiving 2 units of item 2: \\(2 \\times 94 = 188\\)\n     - Value of receiving 3 units of item 3: \\(3 \\times 37 = 111\\)\n     - Value of receiving 5 units of item 4: \\(5 \\times 7 = 35\\)\n     - Value of receiving 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 50 = 100\\)\n     - Total value = 37 + 188 + 111 + 35 + 100 = 471\n     - After discount: \\(471 \\times 0.9 = 423.9\\)\n\n   - **Comparison with outside offer:** 423.9 is significantly less than 841, so accepting the current offer is not favorable.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - **Propose a Counteroffer:** I need to propose an offer where my value exceeds 841 when adjusted for the discount factor. Since it\u2019s not yet round 3, I can propose a counteroffer.\n\n   - Let's construct a counteroffer that can achieve this:\n\n     Let's try keeping as much value as possible while still not being unreasonable:\n\n     Suppose I propose the following division which gives me the rest:\n\n     **Counteroffer ([1, 0, 0, 4, 3]):**\n     - Keep 4 items of item 1: \\(4 \\times 37 = 148\\)\n     - Keep 3 items of item 2: \\(3 \\times 94 = 282\\)\n     - Keep 8 items of item 3: \\(8 \\times 37 = 296\\)\n     - Keep 3 items of item 4: \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\)\n     - Keep 5 items of item 5: \\(5 \\times 50 = 250\\)\n     - Total value = 148 + 282 + 296 + 21 + 250 = 997\n     - After discount: \\(997 \\times 0.9 = 897.3\\)\n\n   This gives me a value of 897.3, which is more than 841. Therefore, the counteroffer is more beneficial than my outside offer, and it improves my standing in this negotiation.\n\nThe action I will take is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 4, 3]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 604. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 510 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 0 + 32 x 0 + 73 x 5 + 2 x 2 + 39 x 6\n    which is 603 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 604. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1018. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 942 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 73 x 0 + 53 x 4 + 78 x 4 + 98 x 5\n    which is 1014 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1018. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 34 x 0 + 89 x 0 + 49 x 4 + 9 x 0\n    which is 196 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 197. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 10 x 3 + 95 x 3 + 57 x 1 + 26 x 3\n    which is 450 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 451. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 2, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 3 + 14 x 0 + 88 x 2 + 64 x 0 + 100 x 5\n    which is 709 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 711. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 3, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 0 + 88 x 2 + 48 x 3 + 3 x 5 + 39 x 3\n    which is 452 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 453. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Below is an example calculation for a counteroffer to keep:\n\n  Suppose I keep: [3, 2, 2, 6, 2]\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n  - 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 3 = 18\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n  - Total Value = 75 + 176 + 96 + 18 + 78 = 443\n  - Discounted Value for Round 2 = 443 \u00d7 0.9 = 398.7\n  Still less than 453, continuing...\n\n  Trying another distribution:\n   Suppose I keep: [4, 2, 2, 6, 2]\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 25 = 100\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n  - 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 3 = 18\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n  - Total Value = 100 + 176 + 96 + 18 + 78 = 468\n  - Discounted Value for Round 2 = 468 \u00d7 0.9 = 421.2\n\nSince this offer still doesn't surpass my outside offer as a fallback, I continue revising:\n\nNow keep: [5, 2, 2, 7, 2]\n- 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 25 = 125\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n- 7 units of item 4 = 7 \u00d7 3 = 21\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n- Total Value = 125 + 176 + 96 + 21 + 78 = 496\n- Discounted Value for Round 2 = 496 \u00d7 0.9 = 446.4\n\nThis is getting closer but still isn't greater than 453. I keep iterating:\n\nFinally, keep: [6, 3, 2, 7, 3] (give: [0, 0, 2, 1, 0])\n- 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 25 = 150\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n- 7 units of item 4 = 7 \u00d7 3 = 21\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n- Total Value = 150 + 264 + 96 + 21 + 117 = 648\n- Discounted Value for Round 2 = 648 \u00d7 0.9 = 583.2\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- **Current Offer**: The current offer does not match my outside offer, therefore, I cannot accept it.\n- **Counteroffer**: Proposal [0, 0, 2, 1, 0] gives me a value of 583.2, better than my outside offer. \n- **Decision**: Make a counteroffer that maximizes my outcome bounded by logical constraints of item availability.\n\nThus, my action will be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 897. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 897. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 819 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 4, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 2 + 85 x 0 + 85 x 4 + 90 x 6 + 5 x 0\n    which is 896 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 897. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 4, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 4, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 85. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1110 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 0 + 51 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 79 x 1 + 48 x 0\n    which is 79 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 85. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

We will see how the remaining items can be divided to give a total value greater than 85:\n\n- If I keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 3, and perhaps 1 unit of item 4, my value would be calculated as follows:\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 x 100 = 300\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 x 51 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 92 = 184\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 x 79 = 79\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 x 48 = 0\n  - Total value = 563\n\nThis value is far greater than 85, which means this allocation leads to high strategic value for me.

Let's consider the following division:\n   - Offer one unit of item 1, two units of item 2, one unit of item 3, two units of item 4, and no units of item 5 to Player 2.\n   - This leaves me with:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n     - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n\n   **Total Value to Me** = 279 + 0 + 198 + 231 + 96 = 804\n\n   This value of 804 is above my outside offer, and thus it serves as a valid counteroffer.\n\n4) **Decision**:\n   Given the above calculations, I will make a counteroffer that maximizes my benefits while seemingly distributing enough value to Player 2 to make it acceptable.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 3 + 45 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 98 x 0\n    which is 300 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 315. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's try distributing the items:\n\n- If I keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 0 of item 5:\n  - My value:\n    - Item 1: 1 unit x 66 = 66\n    - Item 2: 1 unit x 48 = 48\n    - Item 3: 6 units x 71 = 426\n    - Item 4: 2 units x 26 = 52\n    - Total = 66 + 48 + 426 + 52 = 592\n\nThis still isn't quite sufficient. Let's tweak this:\n\n- If I keep 0 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 2 of item 5:\n  - My value:\n    - Item 3: 6 units x 71 = 426\n    - Item 4: 4 units x 26 = 104\n    - Item 5: 2 units x 47 = 94\n    - Total = 426 + 104 + 94 = 624\n\nThis satisfies my requirement.\n\nThus, I will propose the following counteroffer to Player 1:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 0, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 68. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 402 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 0 + 19 x 1 + 62 x 2 + 100 x 2 + 64 x 0\n    which is 343 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 344. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on my action in this negotiation, let's follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 344.\n   - The values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 26\n     - Item 2: 19\n     - Item 3: 62\n     - Item 4: 100\n     - Item 5: 64\n   - The total pool of items is: 6 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 7 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor gamma = 0.9. However, since we're just starting, the full value of any deal we make right now would be considered without any discounting.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Currently, there is no existing offer to accept. Therefore, I need to consider making an initial offer.\n   - I should aim for a proposal that maximizes my value and is higher than my outside offer of 344. Offering a division where I keep certain items with higher total value to me than my fallback is ideal.\n\n   Let's consider retaining a majority of items 3, 4, and 5 since these have higher values per unit for me:\n   - Suppose I offer Player 2: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - Calculating my retained items:\n     - I keep 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n     - I keep 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n     - I keep 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n     - I keep 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n     - I keep 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n   - Total value to me = 78 + 38 + 124 + 400 + 128 = 768\n\n   This value is significantly higher than my outside offer of 344.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since I have calculated a division that gives me a total value of 768, which is better than my outside offer, I should propose it as my initial offer.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, here's my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 0, 3, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 2 + 85 x 3 + 90 x 2 + 55 x 1 + 31 x 1\n    which is 553 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 554. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 161. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 76 x 2 + 4 x 2 + 26 x 0\n    which is 160 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 161. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 240. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 483 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 0 + 6 x 2 + 23 x 0 + 15 x 3 + 91 x 2\n    which is 239 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 240. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 749. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 552 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 6, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 3 + 36 x 2 + 53 x 6 + 38 x 5 + 1 x 0\n    which is 748 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 749. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 749.\n   - **Item Values:** My values per unit for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 56\n     - Item 2: 36\n     - Item 3: 53\n     - Item 4: 38\n     - Item 5: 1\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** There are a total of 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n   - **Discount Factor:** The discount factor influences future offers, meaning the longer the negotiation takes, the less valuable a deal becomes due to the discount rate (gamma=0.9).\n\n2) **Assessing the Offer:**\n\n   - **Value of Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 2, 1, 1], thus I would get:\n     - 0 units of item 1: 0 x 56 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 x 36 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 53 = 106\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 x 38 = 38\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 1 = 1\n     - Total value = 145\n\n   Comparing 145 to my outside offer of 749, this offer is far below my outside offer value.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n\n   - **Accept Current Offer:** No, the current offer's value (145) is much less than my outside offer (749).\n   - **Walk Away:** Walking away guarantees me 749, more than the current offer.\n   - **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer aiming to retain a value above 749.\n\n   Let's compute a counteroffer. I want to keep the value above 749 for myself. I propose:\n\n   Proposal: I keep [3, 2, 4, 4, 0] and the counteroffer to Player 1 will be [0, 0, 2, 2, 2].\n\n   My value from this offer:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 x 56 = 168\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 x 36 = 72\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 x 53 = 212\n   - 4 units of item 4: 4 x 38 = 152\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 x 1 = 0\n   - Total value = 604\n\n   Even though 604 does not surpass my outside offer of 749, it's crucial to find a better division, let's adjust and correct to ensure passing the value of 749.\n\n   Updated proposal: I keep [3, 2, 6, 5, 0] and offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n   Value of revised offer:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 x 56 = 168\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 x 36 = 72\n   - 6 units of item 3: 6 x 53 = 318\n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 x 38 = 190\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 x 1 = 0\n   - Total value = 748\n\nThe maximum value while offering a substantial to Player 1 and trying to match outside offer value through counteroffers seems complex to work efficiently within this round.

However, being round 1, we have the full value with no discount applied yet.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There's no current offer on the table from Player 2.\n   - I need to evaluate potential counteroffers and ensure they give me a value greater than 337.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - I should propose a counteroffer, keeping in mind not to make mistakes such as proposing an offer worse than my outside offer or giving away too much.\n\nBy keeping the majority of high-value items and optimizing based on the available units, my goal is to have a total value greater than 337.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 0 + 48 x 0 + 49 x 2 + 18 x 1 + 5 x 2\n    which is 126 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 127. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 86 x 5 + 93 x 5 + 57 x 1\n    which is 952 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 953. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's go through the analysis step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is 953.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 18 per unit\n  - Item 2: 20 per unit\n  - Item 3: 86 per unit\n  - Item 4: 93 per unit\n  - Item 5: 57 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 8 units of Item 1\n  - 9 units of Item 2\n  - 6 units of Item 3\n  - 6 units of Item 4\n  - 3 units of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: Gamma = 0.9. This will apply in future rounds if negotiations progress.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nAs there is no current offer from Player 2, I will consider making an initial offer to maximize my value. I must ensure any offer provides a value greater than my outside offer.\n\nI need to maintain at least a value of 953 to exceed my outside offer.\n\n#### Calculation for Potential Counteroffer\n\n1. Try keeping more units of high-value items (Items 3, 4, and 5):\n   - Keep all units of Items 3 and 4, and try giving away most of Items 1 and 2.\n   \n2. Assume the following retention and calculation:\n   - Keep all units of Items 3 (6) and 4 (6):\n     - Value of all 6 units of Item 3 = 6 \u00d7 86 = 516\n     - Value of all 6 units of Item 4 = 6 \u00d7 93 = 558\n   - Keep 1 unit of Item 5:\n     - Value of 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 57 = 57\n   - Offer all Units of Item 1 (8) and most Item 2 (8 units):\n     - Value = 18 \u00d7 0 + 20 \u00d7 1 = 20\n\n   Total Value = 516 + 558 + 57 + 20 = 1151 (This exceeds my outside offer of 953)\n\nGiving large amounts of Items 1 and 2 while maintaining a high value surplus from Items 3, 4, and some of Item 5 fulfills my objective of achieving higher than the outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThe plan is to keep all the high-value Items 3 and 4, and some of Item 5 to ensure my total value remains high. I'll make an offer that retains most of the lower-valued items. Based on my calculation for maintaining my total value far beyond 953, this approach is beneficial.\n\nHere is the counteroffer:\n- Offer to Player 2: 8 units of Item 1, 8 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, and 2 units of Item 5.\n\nTherefore, my counteroffer is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [8, 8, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 1, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 6 + 75 x 1 + 88 x 0 + 55 x 2 + 58 x 1\n    which is 597 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 598. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n- **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 598.\n- **Values of the items:**\n  - Item 1: 59\n  - Item 2: 75\n  - Item 3: 88\n  - Item 4: 55\n  - Item 5: 58\n- **Total pool of items:** \n  - 6 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:** We're in round 2, so the discount factor doesn't apply until round 3. If this negotiation proceeds without resolution until the 3rd round, the values would be affected by a discount factor raised to the power of 1 (0.9). However, we must aim to secure a value above 598 given our outside offer.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Value of current offer [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]:**\n  - 2 units of item 1: \\(2 \\times 59 = 118\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 75 = 75\\)\n  - 0 units of item 3: \\(0 \\times 88 = 0\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 4: \\(1 \\times 55 = 55\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 5: \\(1 \\times 58 = 58\\)\n  - **Total Value:** 118 + 75 + 0 + 55 + 58 = 306\n\nThe total value of the current offer (306) is significantly less than my outside offer (598). \n\n- **Example potential counteroffer (to maximize value over 598): [3, 2, 0, 1, 1]:**\n  - I'd keep [3, 1, 0, 2, 2] resulting in:\n  - 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 59 = 177\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 75 = 75\\)\n  - 0 units of item 3: \\(0 \\times 88 = 0\\)\n  - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 55 = 110\\)\n  - 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 58 = 116\\)\n  - **Total Value:** 177 + 75 + 0 + 110 + 116 = 478 \n\n[The proposed potential counteroffer still doesn't yield a higher value]. I need to adjust to ensure a beneficial counteroffer.\n\n### 3) Decision:\n1. **Should I accept the current offer?**\n   - No, because 306 is far less than my outside offer of 598.\n\n2. **Should I walk away?**\n   - Not yet, as there's potential to negotiate a better offer given another round is available.\n\n3. **Should I propose a counteroffer?**\n\nBased on calculations, let's devise a counteroffer that exceeds 598.\n\n**Counteroffer to consider:** [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] (I keep [5, 3, 0, 2, 3])\n- My keeps' value:\n  - 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 59 = 295\\)\n  - 3 units of item 2: \\(3 \\times 75 = 225\\)\n  - 0 units of item 3: \\(0 \\times 88 = 0\\)\n  - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 55 = 110\\)\n  - 3 units of item 5: \\(3 \\times 58 = 174\\)\n  - **Total Value:** 295 + 225 + 0 + 110 + 174 = 804\n\nSince 804 is above my outside offer and leaves reserve for Player 1 to negotiate further without impacting unfavorably, I'll offer them 1, 0, 0, 1, 0.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 0 + 69 x 2 + 5 x 0 + 42 x 1 + 36 x 0\n    which is 180 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 182. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 13 x 0 + 92 x 0\n    which is 0 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 6. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 2, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n- **My outside offer value:** 6\n- **Values of the items:**\n  - Item 1: 42 per unit\n  - Item 2: 96 per unit\n  - Item 3: 37 per unit\n  - Item 4: 13 per unit\n  - Item 5: 92 per unit\n- **Total pool of items:** \n  - Item 1: 7 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 7 units\n- **Discount factor:** The current round is round 1, meaning the discount does not yet apply.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of the offers\n- **Current Offer (what is offered to me):** [3, 2, 2, 1, 4]\n  - My value for this offer:\n    - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n    - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n    - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n    - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n    - 4 units of Item 5 = 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n  - Total value = 126 + 192 + 74 + 13 + 368 = 773\n\nSince 773 is significantly greater than my outside offer value of 6, accepting the offer is better than walking away.\n\n- **Counteroffer Assessment:** \n  Let's evaluate if we can propose a better counteroffer. I must be strategic, ensuring the counteroffer is better for me while being acceptable for Player 1. However, since the current offer already holds considerable value for me, it might be challenging to create a significantly better offer without risking a worse result.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\nThe current offer gives me a total value of 773, which is vastly superior to my outside offer of 6.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 415. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 975 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 0 + 24 x 2 + 64 x 2 + 72 x 1 + 83 x 2\n    which is 414 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 415. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide the next action, let's walk through the steps:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 415.\n   - Values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 82\n     - Item 2: 24\n     - Item 3: 64\n     - Item 4: 72\n     - Item 5: 83\n   - The total pool of items is [2, 3, 2, 5, 2].\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, meaning my value for any agreement from this round is not discounted yet, but it will be if negotiations proceed further. Thus, comparing to my outside offer is directly against a total value threshold of 415.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me is [0, 2, 1, 1, 0], which means:\n     - 0 units of item 1: 0 x 82 = 0\n     - 2 units of item 2: 2 x 24 = 48\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 x 64 = 64\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 x 72 = 72\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0 x 83 = 0\n     - Total value = 184, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 415.\n   - For my last counteroffer: [0, 3, 1, 3, 0], the units I keep are:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 x 82 = 164\n     - 0 units of item 2: 0 x 24 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 x 64 = 64\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 x 72 = 144\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 x 83 = 166\n     - Total value = 538, which is higher than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The current offer gives me a lower value than my outside offer, so I cannot accept it.\n   - I need to make a counteroffer that gives me more than 415 in value to avoid mistake 2.\n   - I could attempt a similar offer to what I proposed last time because it gave me a higher value than my outside offer.\n   - Current balance for items not offered to me are:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 4 unit of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n\nTo further maximize, I will tweak the counteroffer to ensure it secures my value above the outside offer but doesn't overly aggressively diminish Player 2\u2019s interests. \n\nLet's offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]:\n   - This gives me:\n     - 2 units of item 1 (82 each)\n     - 3 units of item 2 (24 each)\n     - 1 unit of item 3 (64 each)\n     - 4 units of item 4 (72 each)\n     - 2 units of item 5 (83 each)\n\nSo, my values with the revised offer would be:\n   - 164 (2x82) + 72 (3x24) + 64 (1x64) + 288 (4x72) + 166 (2x83) = 754\n\nThis is a more opportunistic offer to try and secure slightly more value rounded in my favor but ensuring Player 2 still has decent shares to consider continuing the negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 424. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 453 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 33. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 10 x 2 + 33 x 0 + 82 x 0\n    which is 20 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 33. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Currently, it's round 2, so if I proceed without accepting, I need to discount future offers by multiplying by 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer Value:** The current offer gives me [1, 3, 0, 0, 2].\n     - Item 1: 1 x 45 = 45\n     - Item 2: 3 x 87 = 261\n     - Item 3: 0 x 10 = 0\n     - Item 4: 0 x 33 = 0\n     - Item 5: 2 x 82 = 164\n     - Total Value = 45 + 261 + 0 + 0 + 164 = 470\n   - **Value Post-Discount:** As we're in round 2, this value is multiplied by \\(0.9^1\\), which gives 423.\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The adjusted value of 423 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 33.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Given that the current offer translates to a value of 423 with the discount applied, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 33, it would make little sense to make a counteroffer less than this. Accepting the existing offer would secure a much better deal than my fallback option.\n   - Thus, the logical action is to accept the current offer as it provides substantial value relative to my fallback.\n\nMy action, therefore, is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 281. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 281. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 657 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 6, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 0 + 18 x 1 + 18 x 6 + 57 x 1 + 97 x 1\n    which is 280 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 281. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?
