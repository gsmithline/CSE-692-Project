By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 4, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 3 + 3 x 0 + 8 x 0 + 15 x 4 + 69 x 6\n    which is 648 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 649. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's configure a counteroffer:\n\nLet's propose to keep: \n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nCalculating the value for this offer:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 * 90 = 270\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 88 = 88\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 * 49 = 0\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 * 51 = 0\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 * 47 = 0\n- Total value = 270 + 88 = 358\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of 358, which is still not enough, so let's adjust further. \n\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 5 \n\nCalculating this value:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 * 90 = 270\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 88 = 88\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 49 = 49\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 47 = 94\n- Total value = 270 + 88 + 49 + 94 = 501\n\nAs these do not exceed my outside offer, continue modifications. Further calculations find:\n\nLet me propose a new counteroffer based on another configuration:\n- 3 units of item 1: 270\n- 0 units of item 2: 0\n- 1 unit of item 3: 49\n- 3 unit of item 4: 153\n- 1 unit of item 5: 47\n- Total value = 270 + 0 + 49 + 153 + 47 = 519\n\nThis tentative offer still falls short; hence, considering the nature of current bounds, further alteration is being structured.\n\nFinally, I must configure and provide an eventual fitting counteroffer best of constraints. Here's a valid approach that adjusts for constraints, yet retains maximal potential IoU: \n- 3 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 4 units of item 5\n\nCalculating the total value:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 * 90 = 270\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 * 47 = 188\n- Total value = 270 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 188 = 458\n\nBased on constricted revaluation-sensitive adjustment strategies, I must take affixed minimal acceptable grounds measures:\n\nCounteroffer [0, 0, 3, 0, 4] being critically attempted.\n\nTherefore, due to preceding requisites, overall counteroffer analyzed and judged, remains:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 3, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 3 + 88 x 0 + 49 x 3 + 51 x 3 + 47 x 3\n    which is 711 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 734. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, if the game would be accepted now, the outcome value would be multiplied by 0.9 as it is the second round.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]**:\n  - Value to me:\n    - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 88\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 47\n  - Total value = 88 + 47 = 135\n  - Discounted Value = 135 \u00d7 0.9 = 121.5\n  \nThis current offer is far below my outside offer of 734.\n\n- **Assessing Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - Let's assess a potential counteroffer where I retain high-value items:\n    - Retain [3, 0, 3, 3, 3], give [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] to Player 1 (same as current offer give):\n      - My retained value:\n        - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n        - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n        - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n        - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n        - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n      - Total value = 270 + 0 + 147 + 153 + 141 = 711\n  This potential counteroffer is also less than my outside offer of 734, so it is not advantageous.\n\n### 3) Decision:\n- **Accept the current offer?**\n  - No, because 121.5 is far below 734.\n- **Walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  - It is a better outcome than the current offer.\n- **Propose a specific counteroffer?**\n  - Based on the assessment, no counteroffer exceeding my outside offer value is apparent within realistic scenarios.\n\nThus, my decision is to:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 8, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 88 x 1 + 99 x 3 + 48 x 8 + 39 x 1\n    which is 808 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 809. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 0, 8, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 2, 6, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 2 + 54 x 0 + 56 x 1 + 41 x 4 + 16 x 0\n    which is 378 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 379. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 5, 10] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 82 x 4 + 90 x 0 + 52 x 5 + 71 x 10\n    which is 1298 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1304. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 4, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 6 + 52 x 4 + 56 x 2 + 100 x 0 + 83 x 0\n    which is 896 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 898. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, I should not ACCEPT the current offer.\n   - Walking away will guarantee me a value of 898, which is better than the current offer.\n   - There's an opportunity to propose a counteroffer that would give me a better value than the current offer and potentially be better than my outside offer if accepted.\n\nTo maximize my outcome, I should propose a counteroffer that would give me a value significantly higher than the current offer and possibly entice Player 1 to accept. A potential counteroffer could involve retaining more of the valuable items.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 86 x 2 + 16 x 5 + 11 x 3\n    which is 335 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 336. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's analyze the current situation and the offer on the table step-by-step.\n\n1. **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 710.\n   - My item values:\n     - Item 1: 83\n     - Item 2: 1\n     - Item 3: 22\n     - Item 4: 88\n     - Item 5: 95\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - Item 1: 4 units\n     - Item 2: 4 units\n     - Item 3: 4 units\n     - Item 4: 3 units\n     - Item 5: 5 units\n\n   - Discount factor: The discount factor is 0.9, which reduces the value of offers as rounds go on. But since this is round 1, it does not yet apply.\n\n2. **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n   - Current offer to me: [0, 4, 1, 0, 1]\n   - Calculate the value if I accept this offer:\n     - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 83 = 0\n     - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 1 = 4\n     - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n     - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 88 = 0\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n     - Total value = 0 + 4 + 22 + 0 + 95 = 121\n\n   - Compare 121 to my outside offer of 710. The offer considerably undervalues my opportunity cost.\n\n3. **Decision Making:**\n\n   - I should not accept the current offer because its value (121) is far less than my outside offer (710).\n   - Walking away isn't advisable yet, as it's the first round and there's room to propose a better counteroffer.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than or equal to my outside offer of 710.\n   \n   - Let's consider an initial counteroffer where I propose to give [0, 2, 2, 1, 2]:\n     - This means I would keep [4, 2, 2, 2, 3].\n     - Calculate these values:\n       - 4 units of Item 1 = 4 \u00d7 83 = 332\n       - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n       - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n       - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n       - 3 units of Item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285\n       - Total value = 332 + 2 + 44 + 176 + 285 = 839\n\n   - The counteroffer provides me with a value of 839, which is greater than my outside offer of 710.\n\nGiven these calculations and ensuring I avoid negotiation mistakes, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 52 x 1 + 62 x 5 + 44 x 0\n    which is 362 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 363. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 0 + 94 x 0 + 44 x 2 + 93 x 0 + 94 x 2\n    which is 276 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 279. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on my action, I will analyze the situation following the given steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 279.\n- **Values of the Items to Me:**\n  - Item 1: 78\n  - Item 2: 94\n  - Item 3: 44\n  - Item 4: 93\n  - Item 5: 94\n- **Total Pool of Items:** There are 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor of 0.9 means that the value of an accepted offer decreases with each round. Therefore, delaying acceptance reduces the present value of the deal.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** The current offer from Player 1 is for me to receive [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] and keep the rest.\n  - My value for 1 unit of item 5: 94\n  - Total value if I accept this offer: 94\n  - Since 94 < 279 (my outside offer), this offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** To be better than my outside offer (279), I should receive items with a combined value greater than 279. For example, if I propose keeping [1, 2, 0, 2, 0] (and giving the rest to Player 1),\n  - My value becomes: \n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 78 = 78\n    - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n    - Item 3: 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n    - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n    - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 94 = 0\n    - Total value = 78 + 188 + 186 = 452\n  - 452 > 279, meaning this is better than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThe current offer provides me with a value (94) that is worse than my outside offer (279). Accepting it would be a mistake. Therefore, I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 279.\n\nI will propose the counteroffer [0, 2, 2, 2, 1], which allows me to keep:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 0 units\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nHere's the calculation for my value if I keep these:\n- Item 1: 1 \u00d7 78 = 78\n- Item 2: 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n- Item 3: 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n- Item 4: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n- Item 5: 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n- Total value = 78 + 188 + 0 + 186 + 188 = 640 (greater than my outside offer)\n\nThus, the plan is to give Player 1: [0, 2, 2, 2, 1].

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 2, 9, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 2 + 81 x 3 + 66 x 2 + 97 x 9 + 10 x 0\n    which is 1366 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1367. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1367.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 59\n     - Item 2: 81\n     - Item 3: 66\n     - Item 4: 97\n     - Item 5: 10\n   - The total pool of items is [5, 11, 4, 10, 0].\n   - The discount factor is gamma = 0.9. Since it's round 1, this doesn't impact the decision now, but accepting the offer in this round means no discount.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - For the current offer [5, 0, 0, 8, 0]:\n     - Value from Item 1: 5 \u00d7 59 = 295\n     - Value from Item 2: 0 \u00d7 81 = 0\n     - Value from Item 3: 0 \u00d7 66 = 0\n     - Value from Item 4: 8 \u00d7 97 = 776\n     - Value from Item 5: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n     - Total value of current offer = 295 + 0 + 0 + 776 + 0 = 1071\n\n   - My outside offer is 1367, which is higher than the value of the current offer (1071). Therefore, accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - I should not accept the current offer since it's lower in value than my outside offer.\n   - I should not walk away yet because I may find a better offer than the outside offer.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me more value than my outside offer of 1367.\n\nTo create a counteroffer, I'll start by calculating how many items I need to keep to exceed the value of 1367. A promising potential division might be something like [0, 3, 2, 9, 0] to myself, leading to:\n\n- Value from Item 1: 0 \u00d7 59 = 0\n- Value from Item 2: 8 \u00d7 81 = 648 (I'm giving away 3)\n- Value from Item 3: 2 \u00d7 66 = 132\n- Value from Item 4: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97 (I'm giving away 9)\n- Value from Item 5: 0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n\nThis potential value is 0 + 648 + 132 + 97 + 0 = 877, which is still low.\n\nTo achieve a better outcome, I should aim to give more units from categories I value less. Without over-iterating here, we can try a balanced offer to ensure about 1367 value for myself. Here's a good suggestion based on this provisional step solution:\n\n- Items offered to Player 1: [0, 8, 2, 1, 0] - giving the opponent more from high-value items to me and ensuring sufficient items left reduce not being worse off than my outside offer:\n\nCounteroffer value to me: \n- Value from Item 1: 5 x 59 = 295\n- Value from Item 2: 3 x 81 = 243 (I keep 3)\n- Value from Item 3: 2 x 66 = 132\n- Value from Item 4: 9 x 97 = 873\n- Total = 295 + 243 + 132 + 873 = 1543, which is higher than the outside offer.\n\nThus, I will propose the counteroffer [0, 8, 2, 1, 0], aiming for a favorable distribution.\n\nHere is my action format:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 8, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 8, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 1 + 32 x 8 + 15 x 2 + 3 x 2 + 46 x 0\n    which is 344 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 346. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 8, 2, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 1 + 32 x 8 + 15 x 2 + 3 x 2 + 46 x 0\n    which is 344 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 346. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 6, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, it is more valuable to obtain a deal earlier rather than later if the value is higher than the outside offer.\n\n### 2) Assess Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer to You from Player 1:** [1, 4, 0, 2, 0]\n  - Value if Accepted: \n    - Item 1: 1 * 52 = 52\n    - Item 2: 4 * 32 = 128\n    - Item 3: 0 * 15 = 0\n    - Item 4: 2 * 3 = 6\n    - Item 5: 0 * 46 = 0\n    - Total Value = 52 + 128 + 6 = 186\n  - When adjusted for the discount factor in round 2 (0.9^1 = 0.9), the total value is 186 * 0.9 = 167.4 (which is still less than the outside offer of 346).\n\n- **Compare to Outside Offer:** The current offer is significantly less than my outside offer, thus not acceptable.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffer Consideration:**\n  To make a counteroffer that improves on your position versus the outside offer:\n  - Aim for a total value greater than 346.\n\n### 3) Negotiation Action Decision:\n- Since the current offer is significantly below my outside offer, it's not enough.\n- Propose a counteroffer that gives Player 1 fewer items, maximizing my retained value but more than I previously offered in round 1 to avoid regression.\n\n#### **Propose Counteroffer:**\nTo optimize the division keeping my value above 346:\n- If I keep [1, 5, 2, 1, 0], my value is:\n  - Item 1: 1 * 52 = 52\n  - Item 2: 5 * 32 = 160\n  - Item 3: 2 * 15 = 30\n  - Item 4: 1 * 3 = 3\n  - Item 5: 0 * 46 = 0\n  - Total Value = 52 + 160 + 30 + 3 = 245\n  \nSince 445 (when multiplied by gamma^0 for round 1 = no discount) is higher than 346, I can propose to Player 1:\n- Offer them [1, 4, 1, 2, 0]\n\nBased on calculations:\n- {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 1, 2, 0]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 0, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 1 + 3 x 4 + 81 x 0 + 83 x 5 + 27 x 1\n    which is 538 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 539. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 540. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 753 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 0 + 42 x 1 + 71 x 3 + 31 x 2 + 74 x 3\n    which is 539 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 540. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Currently, since it's the first round, the discount doesn't apply yet, but it will in subsequent rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n#### Current Offer [1, 3, 2, 2, 1]:\n- Value Calculation:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n- **Total Value** = 12 + 57 + 16 + 194 + 42 = 321\n\n#### Compare vs Outside Offer:\n- Current Offer Value (321) > Outside Offer Value (291)\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\nTo make a counteroffer, I need to ensure:\n- It results in a value to me over 291\n\nConsidering I should receive as much of high-value items as possible (especially item 4), let's calculate a possible offer:\n\n**Counteroffer Example**: [1, 2, 2, 1, 1] (offering 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 to Player 1)\n- I keep [4, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 12 = 48\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n- **Total Value** = 48 + 38 + 16 + 291 + 42 = 435\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nSince the current offer (321) surpasses my outside offer (291), accepting it would be beneficial. However, given the possibility of achieving even greater value through a reasonable counteroffer (435), I'll propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while accounting for some balance and enticing Player 1.\n\nGiven the analysis, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 19 x 2 + 8 x 2 + 97 x 2 + 42 x 1\n    which is 290 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 291. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
