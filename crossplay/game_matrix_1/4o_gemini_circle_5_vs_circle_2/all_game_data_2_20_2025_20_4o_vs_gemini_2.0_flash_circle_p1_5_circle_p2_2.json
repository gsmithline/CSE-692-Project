Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 471. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    36 x 0 + 29 x 1 + 57 x 4 + 46 x 0 + 71 x 3\n    which is 470 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 471. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to offer Player 1 something that they will accept, while still giving me a value greater than my outside offer. I want to minimize what I give to Player 1 while still getting the maximum I can keep for myself.\n\nGiven the current offer [0, 0, 3, 0, 3], Player 1 clearly values items 3 and 5. A reasonable approach would be to try and keep more of Item 5, as it is the most valuable to me, and concede on Item 3 a bit. Let's offer Player 1 more of item 3 and less of item 5 in return.\n\nA possible counteroffer could be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me the full value of all items, which is 566. This is significantly higher than my outside offer of 323. However, it's likely Player 1 would reject this.\n\nTo make the counteroffer more appealing to Player 1, let's slightly adjust the offer to be a bit more balanced. Since Player 1's original offer was [0, 0, 3, 0, 3], it suggests they want some of items 3 and 5. We could try giving player 1 [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]. This way player 1 would obtain a positive payoff. I would then have the following:\n\n* Item 1: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n* Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n* Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n* Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n* Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 unit\n\nMy value would then be:\n* Item 1: 3 * 28 = 84\n* Item 2: 1 * 21 = 21\n* Item 3: 3 * 28 = 84\n* Item 4: 3 * 31 = 93\n* Item 5: 2 * 57 = 114\nTotal value = 84 + 21 + 84 + 93 + 114 = 396\n\nSince 396 > 323, this is better than walking away. It is also likely to be better for player 1 than walking away.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [0, 0, 2, 0, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 323. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 495 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 has offered me [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]. This means they are offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of this offer to me:\n- Item 1: 0 * 28 = 0\n- Item 2: 1 * 21 = 21\n- Item 3: 2 * 28 = 56\n- Item 4: 0 * 31 = 0\n- Item 5: 2 * 57 = 114\nTotal value of the offer = 0 + 21 + 56 + 0 + 114 = 191\n\nNow, I need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of this offer to me is 191 * 0.9 = 171.9\n\nMy outside offer is 323. Since 171.9 is much less than 323, I shouldn't accept this offer.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. If I walk away, I get 323. If I make a counteroffer, I have one more round to try to get a better deal.\n\nLet's think about a possible counteroffer. I need to give Player 1 some items to make them accept, but I want to keep as much value as possible for myself.  I have the following amounts of each item: 3 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\nPlayer 1's current offer implies they value item 2, 3 and 5. I value item 5 a lot and Item 4 somewhat.\nWhat if I offered player 1 [0, 0, 3, 0, 3]?\n\nThat means I keep:\n- Item 1: 3 * 28 = 84\n- Item 2: 1 * 21 = 21\n- Item 3: 2 * 28 = 56\n- Item 4: 3 * 31 = 93\n- Item 5: 1 * 57 = 57\nTotal value = 84 + 21 + 56 + 93 + 57 = 311\nDiscounted Value = 311 * 0.9 = 279.9\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 323, so it isn't a very good strategy.\n\nWhat if I offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] i.e. I keep everything, maybe they'll accept a small quantity of item 5.\n\nTotal value = 566. Discounted value = 509.4. That's too high.\nI will try a counteroffer that gives them most of what they want, but slightly improved from their original offer.\nI will offer [0, 0, 2, 0, 3]. That means I keep:\n- Item 1: 3 * 28 = 84\n- Item 2: 1 * 21 = 21\n- Item 3: 3 * 28 = 84\n- Item 4: 3 * 31 = 93\n- Item 5: 1 * 57 = 57\nTotal value = 84 + 21 + 84 + 93 + 57 = 339.\nDiscounted Value = 339 * 0.9 = 305.1\n\nThis is still less than 323. I'm going to WALK.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 4, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 1 + 53 x 2 + 4 x 4 + 85 x 0 + 9 x 1\n    which is 224 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 225. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

My goal is to achieve a value greater than my outside offer of 225.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value**: None to accept.\n- **Formulate Counteroffer**:\n  - I must construct a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer value of 225.\n  - Let's consider an initial approach where I keep most valuable items, maximizing my own total but also leaving Player 2 with an incentive to accept.\n\nI proceed by calculating potential distributions, ensuring I secure a value > 225.\n\n#### Hypothetical Counteroffer\n- Offer the following distribution to Player 2: [0, 0, 3, 0, 2]\n  - This means I keep: [2, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n  \nTo verify:\n- \\[ \\text{My Value} = (2 \\times 93) + (2 \\times 53) + (2 \\times 4) + (3 \\times 85) + (1 \\times 9) \\]\n- \\[ \\text{My Value} = 186 + 106 + 8 + 255 + 9 = 564 \\]\n\n564 is substantially more than my outside offer value of 225, making this a very favorable offer for me.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, my counteroffer allows me to secure a very high value, significantly surpassing the fallback option of my outside offer.

Since the value of the current offer (454) is less than my outside offer (522), I should not accept the current offer.\n\nNow, I need to consider if making a counteroffer is better than walking away. Since this is round 1, there are two more rounds of negotiation. Thus, it is potentially worth trying to negotiate a better deal than my outside offer, when factoring in the discount rate.\n\nI will make a counteroffer. My goal is to get as close to my ideal outcome as possible without being rejected immediately. My values are:\n- Item 1: 73\n- Item 2: 77\n- Item 3: 11\n- Item 4: 31\n- Item 5: 39\n\nI'll start by offering player 1 an allocation that is slightly better for them than their first offer to me, but still in my favor and well above my walkaway. I will offer them: [0,0,2,0,1]. This gives me:\n\n- Item 1: 2 units * 73 = 146\n- Item 2: 2 units * 77 = 154\n- Item 3: 3 units * 11 = 33\n- Item 4: 3 units * 31 = 93\n- Item 5: 2 units * 39 = 78\nTotal value = 146 + 154 + 33 + 93 + 78 = 504\n\nThis result is less than my walk away. I need to create an offer that returns me more than 522. It might be that a good start is to propose an even split across all resources: [1,1,2,1,1] This will ensure I receive the bulk of the value on all the items.\nIf I offer Player 1 [1, 1, 2, 1, 1], then I have\n1 * 73 = 73\n1 * 77 = 77\n3 * 11 = 33\n2 * 31 = 62\n2 * 39 = 78\nWhich equals 323 which is also not a great start.\n\nGiven the information, and the number of rounds left, my best chance to maximize my value is to try and get more of Item 1, Item 2, Item 4 and Item 5, and to concede on Item 3. I will propose the following, aiming for more of what I value and less of what I don't: [0, 0, 4, 1, 2]. This translates to me having:\n2 * 73 = 146\n2 * 77 = 154\n1 * 11 = 11\n2 * 31 = 62\n1 * 39 = 39\nSum: 412, which is less than my outside offer. Let's try something different, I want to test an offer more in my favour and closer to my outside value. If I concede most of item 3, and propose: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n\nThis will result in the following allocation for me.\nItem 1: 2 * 73 = 146\nItem 2: 2 * 77 = 154\nItem 3: 1 * 11 = 11\nItem 4: 3 * 31 = 93\nItem 5: 3 * 39 = 117\nTotal value = 146 + 154 + 11 + 93 + 117 = 521\n\nThis is very close to my walkaway. Let's propose: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nItem 1: 2 * 73 = 146\nItem 2: 2 * 77 = 154\nItem 3: 0 * 11 = 0\nItem 4: 3 * 31 = 93\nItem 5: 3 * 39 = 117\nTotal value = 146 + 154 + 0 + 93 + 117 = 510\n\nSo lets propose to increase item 4 to [0, 0, 5, 1, 0]. Then,\nItem 1: 2 * 73 = 146\nItem 2: 2 * 77 = 154\nItem 3: 0 * 11 = 0\nItem 4: 2 * 31 = 62\nItem 5: 3 * 39 = 117\nTotal Value = 479, which is still far from my walkaway.\n\nIn order to get above my walkaway, let's create an offer giving 0 to them in item 3, 4 and 5, and small units of 1 and 2: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\nItem 1: 1 * 73 = 73\nItem 2: 1 * 77 = 77\nItem 3: 5 * 11 = 55\nItem 4: 3 * 31 = 93\nItem 5: 3 * 39 = 117\nTotal: 415.\n\nWith round 1 completed, I have reason to believe Player 1 values items 3 and 5.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 225. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 4, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 1 + 53 x 2 + 4 x 4 + 85 x 0 + 9 x 1\n    which is 224 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 225. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 1 + 53 x 0 + 55 x 0 + 14 x 0 + 85 x 0\n    which is 42 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 47. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 599. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1020 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 2, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 3 + 80 x 0 + 94 x 2 + 31 x 4 + 63 x 1\n    which is 591 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 599. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 64. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 64. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 972 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 0 + 28 x 0 + 66 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 56 x 1\n    which is 56 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 64. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I'll go through the questions step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 64.\n   - The values of the items for me are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 92 \n     - Item 2: 28 \n     - Item 3: 66 \n     - Item 4: 82 \n     - Item 5: 56 \n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 5 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 8 units of item 5\n   - Since there is no offer on the table yet, I'll prepare to make an initial offer. The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, will influence future rounds. Since this is round 1, the discount hasn't come into effect yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of potential offers:**\n   I will calculate some potential offers and their values to ensure they are better than my outside offer. The goal is to retain items that maximize my value above 64.\n\n   Let's first consider an offer where I give Player 2 reasonable half shares of each, while ensuring my value remains above 64:\n   - Offer to Player 2: [0, 3, 3, 2, 4] \n     - For me: \n       - Items kept: \n         - Item 1: 0 \u00d7 92 = 0\n         - Item 2: (5-3) \u00d7 28 = 56\n         - Item 3: (6-3) \u00d7 66 = 198\n         - Item 4: (4-2) \u00d7 82 = 164\n         - Item 5: (8-4) \u00d7 56 = 224\n       - Total value = 0 + 56 + 198 + 164 + 224 = 642\n   This total value for me, 642, is well above my outside offer value of 64.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   Since I don't want to make mistakes such as offering a value below my outside offer, and my calculated value of 642 is much higher than 64, I will make this offer to Player 2.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 3, 2, 4]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 255. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 483 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 23 x 0 + 40 x 0 + 54 x 4 + 38 x 1\n    which is 254 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 255. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the offer and decide on the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [3, 3, 3, 3, 1], which means Player 1 is offering me 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are: 64, 23, 49, 75, 55.\n\nSo, the value of this offer to me is:\n(3 * 64) + (3 * 23) + (3 * 49) + (3 * 75) + (1 * 55) = 192 + 69 + 147 + 225 + 55 = 688\n\nMy outside offer is 770.\n\nSince 688 is less than my outside offer of 770, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I have a total value of 1110 if I get everything. To beat my outside option, I need to get at least 770 / 0.9 = 855.56 value this round if there's a second round.\n\nLet's think about giving away the items for which I have the least value. My values are 64, 23, 49, 75, 55. Item 2 has the lowest value, so I'll offer all 4 units of item 2.\nNext is item 3 with value 49. I'll also offer all 3 units of item 3.\nNext is item 5 with value 55. I'll also offer all 3 units of item 5.\nThis would mean offering [4, 4, 3, 6, 3] - [3, 0, 0, 0, 0] = [1,4,3,6,3] to them. \nWhat do I receive?\nItem 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\nItem 2 = 4 - 4 = 0\nItem 3 = 3 - 3 = 0\nItem 4 = 6 - 6 = 0\nItem 5 = 3 - 3 = 0\nThis yields a value of 3 * 64 = 192 which is terrible.\n\nI want to leave the negotiation on good terms. Let's try to make an offer where both parties benefit. Let's start by offering the following to Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. That means I would keep [3, 3, 2, 5, 2]. The value of my items would be: 3 * 64 + 3 * 23 + 2 * 49 + 5 * 75 + 2 * 55 = 192 + 69 + 98 + 375 + 110 = 844\n\nNow, consider offering player 1: [0,0,0,0,0]\nMy value would be 4 * 64 + 4 * 23 + 3 * 49 + 6 * 75 + 3 * 55 = 256 + 92 + 147 + 450 + 165 = 1110. That's the best value I can have. But Player 1 will likely reject that.\n\nGiven the situation, and wanting to maximize value, it is difficult to come up with a counteroffer that is better than walking away with my outside option. I think the risk of further rounds reducing my discounted outside option means walking away is the optimal strategy.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 2, 6, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 6 + 73 x 2 + 57 x 6 + 58 x 4 + 5 x 0\n    which is 1218 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1220. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 3, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 3, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 2, 6, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 6 + 73 x 2 + 57 x 6 + 58 x 4 + 5 x 0\n    which is 1218 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1220. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 3, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [7, 3, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [7, 3, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since 935 < 1297, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I need to offer Player 1 something that they will find acceptable, while still giving me a value greater than my outside offer of 1297. Since this is round 1, and the discount factor is 0.9, I should aim for a deal significantly above 1297.\n\nI will start by asking for an even split of the items.\n\nItem 1: I keep 2, offer 3\nItem 2: I keep 2, offer 2\nItem 3: I keep 4, offer 4\nItem 4: I keep 2, offer 3\nItem 5: I keep 3, offer 4\n\nValue of my holdings:\nItem 1: 2 * 34 = 68\nItem 2: 2 * 27 = 54\nItem 3: 4 * 82 = 328\nItem 4: 2 * 62 = 124\nItem 5: 3 * 61 = 183\n\nTotal value: 68 + 54 + 328 + 124 + 183 = 757\n\nThis is obviously still lower than the outside offer.

Let's try a more reasonable split. I will offer 1/3 of each item to the other player.\n\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 2\n\nValue of my holdings:\nItem 1: 3 * 34 = 102\nItem 2: 3 * 27 = 81\nItem 3: 6 * 82 = 492\nItem 4: 4 * 62 = 248\nItem 5: 5 * 61 = 305\n\nTotal Value = 102 + 81 + 492 + 248 + 305 = 1228. This is close but still lower than the outside offer.\n\nI will propose something slightly more favorable to me. I want to get to at least 1300. I will try offering player 1: [1, 1, 2, 1, 1].\n\nRemaining items:\nItem 1: 4 * 34 = 136\nItem 2: 3 * 27 = 81\nItem 3: 6 * 82 = 492\nItem 4: 4 * 62 = 248\nItem 5: 6 * 61 = 366\n\nValue = 136 + 81 + 492 + 248 + 366 = 1323\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer, so it is worthwhile.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 3, 0, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 3 + 90 x 4 + 65 x 3 + 48 x 0 + 73 x 5\n    which is 1214 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1215. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 5, 3, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To evaluate the situation, let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1215.\n   - The values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 98\n     - Item 2: 90\n     - Item 3: 65\n     - Item 4: 48\n     - Item 5: 73\n   - The total pool of items is [5, 4, 8, 5, 7].\n   - The discount factor (gamma) influences the negotiation by reducing the value of benefits from future rounds by 10% each round. Since we are already in round 2, the value of any offer will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n2. **Current Offer Assessment:**\n   - The current offer being made to me gives [1, 1, 2, 1, 1].\n   - Calculating the total value of this offer to me:\n     - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 98 = 98\n     - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n     - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 73 = 73\n     - Total value = 98 + 90 + 130 + 48 + 73 = 439\n   - Adjusted for round 2 (discount factor of 0.9): 439 \u00d7 0.9 = 395.1\n\nSince 395.1 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1215, accepting this offer would not be advantageous. Thus, accepting is not a viable option.\n\n3. **Decision Making:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I won't accept it.\n   - Walking should be considered only if I cannot find a better offer that surpasses my outside offer of 1215.\n   - A counteroffer needs to be made that exceeds the value of 1215 to me. I need to construct a counteroffer and ensure I do not repeat mistakes like offering too much or rejecting a better offer.\n\nLet's determine a plausible counteroffer. For a valid counteroffer:\n- Potential offer: Keep [3, 3, 6, 2, 6] and offer the rest to Player 2, i.e., [2, 1, 2, 3, 1].\n- My value from this division:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n  - Item 3: 6 \u00d7 65 = 390\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n  - Item 5: 6 \u00d7 73 = 438\n  - Total value = 294 + 270 + 390 + 96 + 438 = 1488\n\nSince 1488 is greater than my outside offer of 1215, this counteroffer is better than my fallback option.\n\nThe negotiation continues to Round 3 where gamma would apply, but this offer currently exceeds my outside offer value. Therefore, this is a reasonable counteroffer to make that helps avoid mistakes related to the negotiation.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 3, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1297. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 798 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 3, the final round. Player 1 is offering me [2, 2, 2, 3, 2].

Since this is round 3, there is a discount factor of 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81 applied to any accepted offer.\n\nTherefore, the discounted value of Player 1's offer to me is 594 * 0.81 = 480.54\n\nSince 480.54 is less than my outside offer of 1297, I should WALK away.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 4, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 3 + 20 x 3 + 16 x 4 + 14 x 2 + 52 x 2\n    which is 535 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 537. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I will go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 537.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 93\n     - Item 2: 20\n     - Item 3: 16\n     - Item 4: 14\n     - Item 5: 52\n   - The total pool of items is: \n     - 3 units of Item 1\n     - 5 units of Item 2\n     - 4 units of Item 3\n     - 2 units of Item 4\n     - 2 units of Item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting by reducing the effective value of an agreement in future rounds. In round 1, the effective value remains the same, in round 2 it will be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.81. Thus, earlier agreements retain more value.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - There is currently no offer on the table, so there's no immediate value to assess from accepting.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I need to ensure that the value I retain is higher than my outside offer of 537.\n   - I have to carefully choose what to offer to Player 2 such that my remaining value is maximized while still encouraging them to consider the offer.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - Given my values and the requirement to avoid common negotiation mistakes, I should make a counteroffer where the retained value to me is calculated, ensuring it is greater than 537.\n\n   Here's a possible counteroffer breakdown for maximizing my value:\n   - Keep all units of Item 1 (3 units): 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n   - Keep 2 units of Item 2, offer 3 to Player 2 (2 \u00d7 20 = 40)\n   - Keep 2 units of Item 3, offer 2 to Player 2 (2 \u00d7 16 = 32)\n   - Keep 1 unit of Item 4, offer 1 to Player 2 (1 \u00d7 14 = 14)\n   - Keep all units of Item 5 (2 units): 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n   \n   This would remain with me:\n   - Total value = 279 + 40 + 32 + 14 + 104 = 469\n\n   Comparing this to my outside offer of 537, it is not viable since it is less.\n\n   Let\u2019s further increase the amount kept by:\n   - 3 units of Item 1 (all items), 5 units of Item 2 (all items)\n\n   My retained value is:\n   - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 93 = 279\n   - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 20 = 100\n   - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 16 = 64\n   - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 14 = 28\n   - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 52 = 0\n\n   Total retained value = 279 + 100 + 64 + 28 + 0 = 471\n\n   This is still below my outside offer of 537. I can iteratively increase this by trying a different combination.\n\nIn this case, I cannot find an arrangement where the value of the items I keep is greater than my outside offer of 537. Therefore, the strategic decision is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 542. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 525 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and Player 1 has offered me [2, 2, 1, 2, 0] units of items 1 through 5, respectively. My values for these items are 41, 57, 12, 37, and 28. My outside offer is 542.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n* Item 1: 2 units * 41 = 82\n* Item 2: 2 units * 57 = 114\n* Item 3: 1 unit * 12 = 12\n* Item 4: 2 units * 37 = 74\n* Item 5: 0 units * 28 = 0\nTotal value of current offer: 82 + 114 + 12 + 74 + 0 = 282\n\nSince 282 is much less than my outside offer of 542, accepting is not a good idea.\n\nNow, I'll consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I need to offer Player 1 an amount that they might accept, while leaving me with a value greater than 542. Since it is round 1, there is no discount.\n\nI have 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 in total. The current offer gives Player 1 [2, 2, 1, 2, 0].\nTherefore, if I accept, I will get:\nitem 1: 5-2 = 3 units\nitem 2: 2-2 = 0 units\nitem 3: 5-1 = 4 units\nitem 4: 4-2 = 2 units\nitem 5: 3-0 = 3 units\n\nLet's see if I can make a reasonable counteroffer. I will try to give the other player amounts such that my remaining amount will exceed 542.\n\nI want to keep all item 2 for myself, because it has the highest value.\nMy total value is: 5*41 + 2*57 + 5*12 + 4*37 + 3*28 = 205 + 114 + 60 + 148 + 84 = 611.\nIf I give away everything except item 2, my value is 2 * 57 = 114.\nIf I give away nothing, my value is 611.\n\nThe difference is 611-282 = 329.\nSince it is round 1, and gamma is 0.9, I'm going to make a counteroffer.\n\nSince my value of item 3 is low, I can give most of those to the other player. I will give 4 of item 3 to the other player.\nI'm going to keep all items 2 for myself.\nI'll also give 2 of item 5 to the other player.\nI'll give 2 of item 1 to the other player.\nI'll give 2 of item 4 to the other player.\n\nThen my remaining amount is:\nItem 1: 3, value 3 * 41 = 123\nItem 2: 2, value 2 * 57 = 114\nItem 3: 1, value 1 * 12 = 12\nItem 4: 2, value 2 * 37 = 74\nItem 5: 1, value 1 * 28 = 28\nMy total value = 123+114+12+74+28 = 351\nThis is still smaller than 542.\nOkay, let's just offer everything except for items 2 and 5.\n\noffer: [5, 0, 5, 4, 0]\nMy value: 2 * 57 + 3 * 28 = 114 + 84 = 198\nThis is still not enough.\n\nOkay, I will walk away.\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 1, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 25 x 0 + 96 x 4 + 88 x 1 + 65 x 6\n    which is 862 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 863. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 100 x 1 + 3 x 3 + 81 x 5 + 99 x 4\n    which is 910 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 911. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 618. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 642 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]. This means they want me to have 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 * 41 = 0\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 * 84 = 0\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 * 40 = 120\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 * 28 = 84\n- 0 units of item 5: 0 * 21 = 0\nTotal value of the offer: 0 + 0 + 120 + 84 + 0 = 204\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of the offer is 204 * 0.9 = 183.6\n\nMy outside offer is 618. Since 183.6 is much less than 618, accepting the current offer is not a good option.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value while still giving Player 1 enough to keep them interested. I have the following quantities of each item: 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 6 of item 4, and 5 of item 5.\n\nHere's a possible strategy: Offer Player 1 a fair share to see if we can settle this round. The ideal outcome for me is getting almost all of items 2 and 1 and a big chunk of item 5. Maybe offer half of the items to Player 1:\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]\n- Player 1 gets 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nValue to me is:\n(2 * 41) + (2 * 84) + (2 * 40) + (3 * 28) + (3 * 21) = 82 + 168 + 80 + 84 + 63 = 477\nPresent value: 477 * 0.9 = 429.3. Still lower than my outside option.\n\nOkay, let's try to make the counter offer more favorable to me:\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n- Player 1 gets 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\nThis means I keep 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\nValue to me is:\n(3 * 41) + (3 * 84) + (3 * 40) + (3 * 28) + (5 * 21) = 123 + 252 + 120 + 84 + 105 = 684\nPresent value: 684 * 0.9 = 615.6. Still lower than my outside option, but very close.\n\nI will offer the counteroffer [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]. It gives me a value close to my outside option, and may entice Player 1 to make a final offer that is more advantageous.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 5, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 100 x 1 + 3 x 3 + 81 x 5 + 99 x 4\n    which is 910 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 911. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 3, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 2 + 16 x 0 + 98 x 3 + 57 x 0 + 92 x 4\n    which is 742 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 744. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, I need to evaluate my possible choices based on my values and the constraints provided:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My guaranteed value if I decide to walk away is 744.\n- **Item Values**: The value per unit for each item type to me is:\n  - Item 1: 40\n  - Item 2: 16\n  - Item 3: 98\n  - Item 4: 57\n  - Item 5: 92\n- **Total Items Available**: \n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 1 unit\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n- **Discount Factor**: The value for any decision in future rounds will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer from Player 2, so nothing to assess here.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose something that gives me a total value greater than my outside offer. Let's calculate some potential offers:\n\n  - If I keep [3, 4, 3, 1, 4] (i.e., all items) and offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2:\n    - Total Value: \\(3 \\times 40 + 4 \\times 16 + 3 \\times 98 + 1 \\times 57 + 4 \\times 92 = 903\\)\n    - This value is well above my outside offer, so this division would work for me.\n\n  - If I try a reasonable split, like keeping [2, 3, 2, 0, 3] and offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to Player 2:\n    - Value for me: \\(2 \\times 40 + 3 \\times 16 + 2 \\times 98 + 0 \\times 57 + 3 \\times 92 = 40 \\times 2 + 48 + 196 + 276 = 600\\) which is below 744 and not acceptable.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, I should propose a counteroffer where my total value exceeds my outside offer of 744. A proposal might look like:\n\n- Keep: [3, 2, 3, 0, 3] (Offer [0, 2, 0, 1, 1] to Player 2)\n  - Value for me: \\(3 \\times 40 + 2 \\times 16 + 3 \\times 98 + 0 \\times 57 + 3 \\times 92 = 120 + 32 + 294 + 276 = 722\\),\n  - Which is still below 744, so adjustments needed to maintain a higher value than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try another split:\n\n- Keep: [3, 3, 2, 1, 3] (Offer [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] to Player 2)\n  - Value for me: \\(3 \\times 40 + 3 \\times 16 + 2 \\times 98 + 1 \\times 57 + 3 \\times 92 = 120 + 48 + 196 + 57 + 276 = 697\\),\n  - Still below 744, but getting closer.\n\nThus, I will propose a different split:\n\n- Keep: [3, 3, 3, 1, 2] (Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 2] to Player 2)\n  - Value for me: \\(3 \\times 40 + 3 \\times 16 + 3 \\times 98 + 1 \\times 57 + 2 \\times 92 = 120 + 48 + 294 + 57 + 184 = 703\\),\n  - Still insufficient. This indicates I should keep almost all high-value items.\n\nTherefore, here is a potential effective strategy with a higher chance of success:\n\n- Keep [3, 3, 3, 1, 3] (Offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] to Player 2):\n  - Value for me: \\(3 \\times 40 + 3 \\times 16 + 3 \\times 98 + 1 \\times 57 + 3 \\times 92 = 120 + 48 + 294 + 57 + 276 = 795\\)\n\nSince this is above 744, it is advantageous.\n\nThus, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 110. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 2, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer on the table is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], meaning I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n\nMy values are:\nItem 1: 63\nItem 2: 48\nItem 3: 74\nItem 4: 65\nItem 5: 25\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 63) + (0 * 48) + (0 * 74) + (1 * 65) + (0 * 25) = 65\n\nSince this is round 2, we need to apply the discount factor gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nSo, the present value of the current offer is 65 * 0.9 = 58.5\n\nMy outside offer is 110. Therefore, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer something that Player 1 might accept, while still giving me a value greater than 110 / 0.9 = 122.22. The total number of items are 3, 4, 3, 1, 4.\n\nLet's evaluate the previous offer Player 1 made [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This would give me [3, 3, 3, 1, 3]. The value to me would be (3 * 63) + (3 * 48) + (3 * 74) + (1 * 65) + (3 * 25) = 189 + 144 + 222 + 65 + 75 = 695. The discounted value would be 695 * 0.9 = 625.5\n\nMy previous offer was [2, 3, 2, 0, 3]. If I accept this then I would get [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which is terrible for me. Its value would be (1 * 63) + (1 * 48) + (1 * 74) + (1 * 65) + (1 * 25) = 63 + 48 + 74 + 65 + 25 = 275. And 275 * 0.9 is 247.5, which is greater than the outside option of 110.\nOkay, I'll try a different counteroffer. I will try to get Item 3 and Item 4. How about this counteroffer: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]? That means I get 3, 4, 1, 1, 4 of the items respectively. The value to me would be (3 * 63) + (4 * 48) + (1 * 74) + (1 * 65) + (4 * 25) = 189 + 192 + 74 + 65 + 100 = 620. This translates to 620 * 0.9 = 558. That's still way too much.\n\nLet's try to make it more aggressive, offering almost everything away:\n[2, 3, 2, 0, 3]\nThat is 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 to me. So as before it will be worth 275 * 0.9 = 247.5\n\nOkay, given these calculations, the best action is to make the same offer as before.\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 2, 0, 3]}\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 3, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 2 + 16 x 0 + 98 x 3 + 57 x 0 + 92 x 4\n    which is 742 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 744. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 4, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 4 + 31 x 0 + 5 x 4 + 3 x 2 + 75 x 0\n    which is 174 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 175. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 759. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1059 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 88. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 468 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 30 x 1 + 52 x 1 + 60 x 0 + 4 x 1\n    which is 86 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 88. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My private values are 17, 70, 91, 78, 76 for items 1 through 5, respectively. My outside offer is 1713. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 17 = 51\n*   0 units of item 2: 0 * 70 = 0\n*   2 units of item 3: 2 * 91 = 182\n*   0 units of item 4: 0 * 78 = 0\n*   5 units of item 5: 5 * 76 = 380\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 51 + 0 + 182 + 0 + 380 = 613\n\nSince it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  Therefore, the present value of accepting the current offer is 613 * 0.9 = 551.7\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 1713. I need to make a counteroffer that is better for me than walking away, which means I need to offer something that Player 1 will accept, but results in a total discounted value greater than 1713 for myself.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 slightly less than what they offered me in round 1.\nRound 1 offer: [4, 1, 2, 0, 5] - this leaves me with [0, 0, 2, 11, 0]\nMy value for that would be: 0*17 + 0*70 + 2*91 + 11*78 + 0*76 = 182 + 858 = 1040\nDiscounted Value: 1040 * 0.9 = 936 which is still way less than 1713.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. This leaves me with [3, 1, 3, 11, 4].\n\nMy value would then be: 3*17 + 1*70 + 3*91 + 11*78 + 4*76 = 51 + 70 + 273 + 858 + 304 = 1556\nDiscounted: 1556 * 0.9 = 1400.4. Still less than 1713\n\nLet's try offering player 1 [0,0,0,0,0]. This gives me [4,1,4,11,5].\n\nValue: 4*17 + 1*70 + 4*91 + 11*78 + 5*76 = 68 + 70 + 364 + 858 + 380 = 1740\nDiscounted: 1740 * 0.9 = 1566. Still less than 1713.\n\nSince this is round 2, and I cannot reach my outside option value with any offer, I must consider that if negotiations go to round 3 and I propose an offer there, then the discount is 0.9^2 = 0.81. If I walk, I will receive 1713. Let me think if there is an offer that I can propose that would benefit me more than walking away.\n\nGiven that all offers result in a discounted value of less than 1713, I should walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 0, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 4 + 34 x 2 + 31 x 0 + 32 x 1 + 70 x 5\n    which is 590 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 591. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 0, 1, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 4 + 34 x 2 + 31 x 0 + 32 x 1 + 70 x 5\n    which is 590 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 591. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

My private values are 95, 37, 15, 33, and 6 for items 1 through 5 respectively, and my outside offer is 664. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 95 = 95\n*   2 units of item 2: 2 * 37 = 74\n*   0 units of item 3: 0 * 15 = 0\n*   2 units of item 4: 2 * 33 = 66\n*   0 units of item 5: 0 * 6 = 0\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 95 + 74 + 0 + 66 + 0 = 235\n\nSince it is round 2, I need to apply the discount factor: 235 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 235 * 0.9 = 211.5\n\nComparing this to my outside offer of 664, the current offer is significantly worse. I need to decide whether to make a counteroffer or walk away. Since this is round 2, making a counteroffer is still viable.\n\nTo maximize my value, I should offer Player 1 the minimum they would accept while still getting more than my outside offer. However, without knowing Player 1's values, this is impossible to know precisely. A reasonable strategy is to offer a deal that is better than my outside option for me while being somewhat favorable to Player 1 so they would accept.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping all the items for myself:\n* 5 units of item 1: 5 * 95 = 475\n* 3 units of item 2: 3 * 37 = 111\n* 2 units of item 3: 2 * 15 = 30\n* 4 units of item 4: 4 * 33 = 132\n* 5 units of item 5: 5 * 6 = 30\nTotal value = 475 + 111 + 30 + 132 + 30 = 778\n\nI want to get at least 664/0.9 = 737.77 in this round's value.\n\nI will construct an offer where I keep most of the valuable items and give away the least valuable items.

Let's try keeping all the items 1,2, and 4, and just offer Player 1 2 units of items 3 and 5.\nOffer [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nMy value:\n* 5 units of item 1: 5 * 95 = 475\n* 3 units of item 2: 3 * 37 = 111\n* 0 units of item 3: 0 * 15 = 0\n* 4 units of item 4: 4 * 33 = 132\n* 3 units of item 5: 3 * 6 = 18\nTotal value = 475 + 111 + 0 + 132 + 18 = 736\nDiscounted value = 736 * 0.9 = 662.4, which is still less than 664.\n\nTo get to 737.77, I need a value of 737.77/0.9 = 819.74. This is impossible without knowing Player 1's values.\n\nGiven the information, the best option seems to be to make a counteroffer that gets me close to my discounted outside option.\n\nLet's try offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 3]:\nMy value:\n* 4 units of item 1: 4 * 95 = 380\n* 2 units of item 2: 2 * 37 = 74\n* 2 units of item 3: 2 * 15 = 30\n* 3 units of item 4: 3 * 33 = 99\n* 2 units of item 5: 2 * 6 = 12\nTotal value = 380 + 74 + 30 + 99 + 12 = 595\nDiscounted value = 595 * 0.9 = 535.5\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means values decrease as the rounds progress, incentivizing earlier agreements if beneficial.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\nThere is no current offer on the table, so we need to create an initial offer. First, I must ensure the offer I keep is worth more than my outside option of 53.\n\nLet's determine my total value if I were to keep certain units and offer the rest to Player 2:\n\n1. **Offer all units to myself**:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n   - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n   - 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 26 = 130\n   - Total: 508\n\nClearly, this is not feasible as a counteroffer because it gives Player 2 nothing.\n\nNow analyze a fair distribution of units where my value stays over 53:\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffer**:\n   - Offer to give Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n   - My kept units are: [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\nLet's calculate the value for this division:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n   - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 84 = 84\n   - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n   - Total value: 318\n\n318 is significantly higher than the outside offer of 53, making it a valuable starting point.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision:\n- I will make a counteroffer that ensures I have a high enough value compared to my outside offer, and consider leaving items for Player 2 that may be less valuable to me. Thus, I propose to offer Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 0, 3].\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 56\n- Item 2: 14\n- Item 3: 89\n- Item 4: 19\n- Item 5: 7\n\nThe value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 56) + (1 * 14) + (1 * 89) + (0 * 19) + (3 * 7) = 0 + 14 + 89 + 0 + 21 = 124\n\nMy outside offer is 74. Since 124 > 74, accepting the offer is better than walking away *in this round*.\n\nNow, let's consider if making a counteroffer is beneficial. Since this is round 1, there are two more rounds. Let's figure out the total possible value of the items.\n- Item 1: 2 * 56 = 112\n- Item 2: 3 * 14 = 42\n- Item 3: 2 * 89 = 178\n- Item 4: 1 * 19 = 19\n- Item 5: 5 * 7 = 35\nTotal Value = 112 + 42 + 178 + 19 + 35 = 386\n\nThe discount factor is 0.9.\n\nIf I accept now, I get 124.\n\nIf I make a counteroffer, there is a chance it will be accepted in round 2 or round 3. Let's consider an 'optimistic' outcome in terms of the value. For example, if I offered them nothing, I would get 386. So, assume I can get at least 300 in future rounds.\nRound 2 value with discount is 300 * 0.9 = 270\nRound 3 value with discount is 300 * 0.9^2 = 243\n\nI can aim for a counteroffer that gives them the minimum acceptable amount for them, or aim to achieve an equal distribution with the hope that it will be accepted to not risk a WALK. Since I do not know their values, I will aim for an equal distribution.\n\nTotal items: 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 5 of item 5\nEqual distribution implies:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 1.5 units\nItem 3: 1 unit\nItem 4: 0.5 units\nItem 5: 2.5 units\n\nSince you cannot give half an item, I can offer them the following:\n[1, 1, 1, 0, 3] (This is not a fair offer, but I'm just calculating to compare to my outside offer)\nThis leaves me with [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]. My value is:\n(1 * 56) + (2 * 14) + (1 * 89) + (1 * 19) + (2 * 7) = 56 + 28 + 89 + 19 + 14 = 206\n\nHowever, the current offer provides me 124, so I should try to make a counteroffer that provides more value.\n\nOffer them: [1, 1, 1, 0, 3] which results in [1, 2, 1, 1, 2] for me. value = 206.\nIf I offer [0, 1, 1, 0, 3], I get [2, 2, 1, 1, 2] for me. value = (2*56)+(2*14)+(1*89)+(1*19)+(2*7) = 112 + 28 + 89 + 19 + 14 = 262\n\nLet's test a slightly more aggressive offer:\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - keeping everything. My value is 386.\n\nThe key here is I need more information to make a good counter offer. I am going to try to get more by making a somewhat aggressive, but not completely unreasonable counter offer, in hopes it will be accepted or lead to something better next round.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]}\n",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 3, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 3 + 11 x 5 + 17 x 3 + 32 x 4 + 54 x 3\n    which is 537 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 539. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

However, currently, we are in round 1, so the full value of any agreement is available without discount.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to evaluate, as no offer has been made by either side.\n   - Construct a counteroffer: I need to propose an allocation that results in a value higher than my outside offer of 539.\n\nLet's try to find an offer where I keep a large portion but remain above my outside offer:\n\n- Consider keeping [3, 3, 2, 3, 2] items for myself:\n  - Value calculation: \n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 17 = 34\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 54 = 108\n  - Total value to me if I keep this: 141 + 33 + 34 + 96 + 108 = 412\n  - This is less than my outside offer of 539.\n\nInstead, let's consider keeping most of the high-value items:\n\n- Consider keeping [3, 2, 3, 2, 3] items for myself:\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n  - Total value to me if I keep this: 141 + 22 + 51 + 64 + 162 = 440\n  - This is again less than my outside offer of 539.\n\nFinally, let's ensure the best allocation considering maximum gains:\n\n- Consider keeping [3, 5, 4, 2, 3] items for myself:\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n    - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 11 = 55\n    - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 17 = 68\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n  - Total value to me if I keep this: 141 + 55 + 68 + 64 + 162 = 490\n  - This is still less than my outside offer of 539.\n\nSince proposing these values cannot meet my outside offer, I need to propose a division that maximizes my most valuable items, and rightfully claim the whole pool leaving minimum possible worth to Player 2 that still has a reasonable appearance.\n\nLet's re-evaluate from a lower allocation setup:\n\n- Now, keep [3, 5, 4, 4, 3] items for myself is effectively keeping everything. (Propose a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 2) and evaluate:\n\n  - Keeping all:\n    - This is unrealistic but ensures I am not offering immediate concessions. If critical alignment guarantees maximum possible value or pressures return offers.\n\n- Evaluating alternatives must gain steady leverage but not immediate Walk as no viable proposal arisen that respects fixed constraint nor surpasses outside scenario. Thus, revert focusing essential resolution:\n\n- Align more for extensive shares through format of acknowledged impact but first broad declination for larger advocacy ahead.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nGiven our stepwise evaluation, any substantial compromise with initial proposal exceeds lineup beneficial equilibrium providing a revised draw. Secure presence to procure favorable premise validates seeking further counterpositions or edit extensions. \n\nThus, upon assessing strategy, offering straightforward advantage leverages encapsulated zero output for adversary while detecting next cession without compromising backend fallback:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",
