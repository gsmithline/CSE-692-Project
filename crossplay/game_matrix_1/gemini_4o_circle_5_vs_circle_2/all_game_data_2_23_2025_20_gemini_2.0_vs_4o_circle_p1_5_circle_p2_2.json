Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 622. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 622. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 840 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 1 + 18 x 1 + 39 x 2 + 36 x 1 + 100 x 4\n    which is 619 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 622. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer. I need to make the first offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to explore potential divisions and their value to me. The goal is to find an offer that gives the other player enough to accept, while still leaving me with a value greater than my outside offer of 622.\n\n3) **Considerations for the offer:**\n    *   **Mistake 2:** The offer must be better than my outside offer.\n    *   **Mistake 3:** Do not offer nothing or everything to the other player.\n    *   I want to propose an offer that is likely to be accepted or at least considered by the other player.\n    *   Since it is the first round, there is a strong advantage to making an offer.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nI will start by considering an offer that is somewhat generous to the other player, but still ensures that my value is above my outside offer. I'll aim for a split that gives them a significant portion of the items, but leaves me with enough of the high-value items to make it worthwhile.\nLet's consider offering the other player the following:\n\n*   Item 1: 0\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 2\n*   Item 4: 0\n*   Item 5: 2\n\nThis leaves me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 1\n*   Item 5: 3\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(1 * 87) + (1 * 18) + (1 * 39) + (1 * 36) + (3 * 100) = 87 + 18 + 39 + 36 + 300 = 480\n\nThis is less than my outside offer, so this offer is not viable.\nLet's consider offering the other player the following:\n\n*   Item 1: 0\n*   Item 2: 1\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 0\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nThis leaves me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 1\n*   Item 2: 2\n*   Item 3: 2\n*   Item 4: 1\n*   Item 5: 4\n\nMy value for this division would be:\n(1 * 87) + (2 * 18) + (2 * 39) + (1 * 36) + (4 * 100) = 87 + 36 + 78 + 36 + 400 = 637\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer of 622.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 6, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 1 x 1 + 68 x 6 + 32 x 2 + 82 x 0\n    which is 473 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 474. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 10. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 20 x 0 + 30 x 0 + 9 x 1\n    which is 9 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 10. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 953. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 810 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [4, 5, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 5, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This requires careful calculation to ensure it exceeds my outside offer value.\n\nLet's propose a division that might get this over our outside offer:\n\n**Hypothetical Counteroffer: [2, 1, 0, 1, 0] (For Player 1)**\n\n#### Calculating my retained value:\nPlayer 2 (me) retains: [3, 5, 2, 3, 2]\n\n- Retained value from item 1 (3 units): \\(3 \\times 89 = 267\\)\n- Retained value from item 2 (5 units): \\(5 \\times 29 = 145\\)\n- Retained value from item 3 (2 units): \\(2 \\times 52 = 104\\)\n- Retained value from item 4 (3 units): \\(3 \\times 67 = 201\\)\n- Retained value from item 5 (2 units): \\(2 \\times 33 = 66\\)\n\n**Total Value of Retained:**\n\\[ 267 + 145 + 104 + 201 + 66 = 783 \\]\n\n### Value with Discount Factor\nIf my counteroffer is accepted, given that this is also Round 2:\n\\[ 783 \\times 0.9 = 704.7 \\]\n\nThis is still lower than 953 (my outside offer), but let's try a more adjusted offer that manages item 3 and maximizes item 1 and others.\n\n### Optimizing Counteroffer\n\n**Optimized Counteroffer: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0] (For Player 1, keeping more items for me)**\n\nCalculating retained (Player 2, me): [4, 5, 2, 3, 2] \n\n- Retained value from item 1 (4 units): \\(4 \\times 89 = 356\\)\n- Retained value from item 2 (5 units): \\(5 \\times 29 = 145\\)\n- Retained value from item 3 (2 units): \\(2 \\times 52 = 104\\)\n- Retained value from item 4 (3 units): \\(3 \\times 67 = 201\\)\n- Retained value from item 5 (2 units): \\(2 \\times 33 = 66\\)\n\n**Total Value of Retained:**\n\\[ 356 + 145 + 104 + 201 + 66 = 872 \\]\n\nWith discount in round 2:\n\\[ 872 \\times 0.9 = 784.8 \\]\n\nThis calculation indicates switching up more towards my higher-value items and reducing rounds. Given this revision with its reinforced value distribution, allow me to finalize a response suitable with balance attempts:\n\n**Final Offer: [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]**\n\nThis raises the offer value internally yet still is less than offer, with opportunity on inbound from Player 1 acceptance.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the limits proposed beyond this calculation, the best closing approach facing current offer and theory engaged:\n\n- **WALK** due to outcome, as no approval achieves >953.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 4, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 1 + 88 x 5 + 91 x 4 + 24 x 0 + 72 x 4\n    which is 1132 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1135. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This means offers in later rounds are worth less than offers accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - There is no current offer on the table.\n   - I need to propose an offer. I will start by considering an offer that gives a reasonable amount to the other player while still exceeding my outside offer. I need to offer something to the other player to initiate negotiations, but also aim to secure a high value for myself, given my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider a Potential Counteroffer:**\n\nI will construct a counteroffer where I give Player 2 a reasonable amount and keep a sufficient amount of items for myself.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 4, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 1 + 88 x 5 + 91 x 4 + 24 x 0 + 72 x 4\n    which is 1132 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1135. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 550. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 411 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 2 + 2 x 0 + 11 x 1 + 22 x 4 + 82 x 5\n    which is 549 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 550. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action for round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 550\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 20, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 11, Item 4: 22, Item 5: 82\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me than an offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to propose an offer that leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer of 550. I also want to leave the other player with enough value to make them consider accepting.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince there is no current offer, I need to make an initial offer. I will try to create an offer that provides me with a good value while still being potentially acceptable to Player 2. A good starting point might be to offer approximately half of the total value of the items, and adjust to keep my own value above 550.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I give the other player 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n*   Item 1 I keep: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   Item 2 I keep: 5 - 2 = 3\n*   Item 3 I keep: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   Item 4 I keep: 5 - 2 = 3\n*   Item 5 I keep: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nMy value: (1 * 20) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 11) + (3 * 22) + (3 * 82) = 20 + 6 + 11 + 66 + 246 = 349. This is lower than my outside offer, so this will not work.\n\nLet's increase my portion of item 5 to 4:\n\n*   Item 1 I keep: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   Item 2 I keep: 5 - 2 = 3\n*   Item 3 I keep: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   Item 4 I keep: 5 - 2 = 3\n*   Item 5 I keep: 5 - 1 = 4\n\nMy value: (1 * 20) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 11) + (3 * 22) + (4 * 82) = 20 + 6 + 11 + 66 + 328 = 431. Still lower than my outside offer.\n\nLet's increase my portion of item 5 to 5 (keeping all of it):\n\n*   Item 1 I keep: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   Item 2 I keep: 5 - 2 = 3\n*   Item 3 I keep: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   Item 4 I keep: 5 - 2 = 3\n*   Item 5 I keep: 5 - 0 = 5\n\nMy value: (1 * 20) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 11) + (3 * 22) + (5 * 82) = 20 + 6 + 11 + 66 + 410 = 513. Still lower than my outside offer.\n\nLet's increase my portion of item 4 to 4:\n\n*   Item 1 I keep: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   Item 2 I keep: 5 - 2 = 3\n*   Item 3 I keep: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   Item 4 I keep: 5 - 1 = 4\n*   Item 5 I keep: 5 - 0 = 5\n\nMy value: (1 * 20) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 11) + (4 * 22) + (5 * 82) = 20 + 6 + 11 + 88 + 410 = 635.

I can refine this if it is rejected.\n\nHere's my initial counteroffer:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 2\n\nThis means I would keep:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 3\nItem 5: 2\n\nMy value would be:\n2 * 87 + 2 * 34 + 2 * 43 + 3 * 75 + 2 * 40 = 174 + 68 + 86 + 225 + 80 = 633\n\nThis value (633) is much larger than my outside offer (98). It's a safe starting point.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 3, 2]}\n```",

Therefore, the current offer is not acceptable to me as it is less than what I am guaranteed to receive from the outside offer. \n\n**Counteroffer Strategy:**\nI need to present a counteroffer that aims to achieve a total value greater than 680, while still being reasonable to Player 1. Let's consider a new division, ensuring my value is above my outside offer.\n\n**Consider Allocating:**\nFor example, a plausible counteroffer for me could be:\n- I take 3 units of item 1.\n- I take 2 units of item 2.\n- I take 3 units of item 3.\n- I take 4 units of item 4.\n- I take 2 units of item 5.\n\n**How to Specify the Counteroffer:**\nTo create these conditions in my favor, I need to specify the offer I can make to Player 1, i.e., what they receive. Calculating my values:\n- My new proposed allotment:\n  - Item 1: \\((4 - 3) = 1\\) for Player 1\n  - Item 2: \\((3 - 2) = 1\\) for Player 1\n  - Item 3: \\((4 - 3) = 1\\) for Player 1\n  - Item 4: \\((6 - 4) = 2\\) for Player 1\n  - Item 5: \\((4 - 2) = 2\\) for Player 1\n\nThis results in the following counteroffer: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n\n**Calculating My New Offer Value:**\n- Value from Item 1: \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\)\n- Value from Item 2: \\(2 \\times 34 = 68\\)\n- Value from Item 3: \\(3 \\times 47 = 141\\)\n- Value from Item 4: \\(4 \\times 74 = 296\\)\n- Value from Item 5: \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\)\n\n**New Total Value:**\n\\[120 + 68 + 141 + 296 + 28 = 653\\]\n\nMy new proposed outcome still doesn't exceed my outside offer of 680, so I will try to modify it further such that my value exceeds 680 or close to it. Considering additional unit adjustments:\n\n**New Plan for Allocation:**\n- I choose 3 of item 1\n- I choose 1 of item 2\n- I choose 3 of item 3\n- I choose 4 of item 4\n- I choose 3 of item 5\n\nPlayer 1 hence receives:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 2 units\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 2 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\n**Offer for Player 1:**\n\\[ \\text{[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]} \\]\n\n**Calculating Final Offer Value:**\n- New value to me: \n  - \\(3 \\times 40\\) + \\(1 \\times 34\\) + \\(3 \\times 47\\) + \\(4 \\times 74\\) + \\(3 \\times 14\\) \n  - \\(= 120 + 34 + 141 + 296 + 42 = 633\\)\n\nStill less than 680. But let's apply time discount factor as having already used one turn.\n\nConsider that a realistic discount factor of \\(\\gamma^{r-1} = \\gamma^{1-1} = 1\\) applies, iterations may approach \u221e altering optimality nearer 680 if offered beyond. Balancing means playing closer to or more fairly ensuring the next best option exceeds proposal \u2265 680 inherently.\n\nDecide to attempt influencing Player 1 closer or walk:\n\n**Moving Forward | Counteroffer Proposal:**\n\\[\n\\text{{Make an offer of }} [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\\]\n\nMy risk adjusted total:\n\\[\n3 \\times 40 + 2 \\times 34 + 3 \\times 47 + 3 \\times 74 + 3 \\times 14 = 826\n\\]\n\n**Stage next: Specify Counteroffer:**\n\\[\n\\text{{Player 1 receives}}: [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\\]\n\nEnsure strategic dynamic synergy, balancing exchange potentials.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 1 + 34 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 40 x 0\n    which is 87 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 98. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

I should also consider the risk of the negotiation breaking down, which would leave me with only 98. Let's think about offering a slightly modified version of what they previously offered.\n\n    *   **Try offering Player 2:** [1, 0, 1, 3, 1]\n    *   This would leave me with: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n    *   My value: (3 * 87) + (3 * 34) + (3 * 43) + (3 * 75) + (3 * 40) = 261 + 102 + 129 + 225 + 120 = 837\n    *   Discounted value of this offer: 837 * 0.9 = 753.3\n\n    *   **Try offering Player 2:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - Giving all items to myself.\n        *   My value: (4 * 87) + (3 * 34) + (4 * 43) + (6 * 75) + (4 * 40) = 348 + 102 + 172 + 450 + 160 = 1232\n        *   Discounted value: 1232 * 0.9 = 1108.8\n        *   This is the best value but is very unlikely to be accepted.\n        *   Giving all items to myself is probably Mistake 3.\n\n    *   **Let's try increasing item 4 to incentivize player 2 to accept counter offer**\n    *   **Try offering Player 2:** [1, 1, 1, 4, 1]\n        *   My value: (3 * 87) + (2 * 34) + (3 * 43) + (2 * 75) + (3 * 40) = 261 + 68 + 129 + 150 + 120 = 728\n        *   Discounted value: 728 * 0.9 = 655.2\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nAccepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 386.1. Offering [1, 0, 1, 3, 1] to player 2 gives me a discounted value of 753.3, and Offering [1, 1, 1, 4, 1] gives me a discounted value of 655.2. Offering 0 to the other player is highly unlikely to be accepted.\n\nThe discounted value of my previous offer is 569.7. This is less than my value if I make offer [1, 0, 1, 3, 1].\n\nSince 386.1 < 753.3. It's better to make a counteroffer, since [1, 0, 1, 3, 1] leads to a value of 753.3\n\nI will offer [1, 0, 1, 3, 1] to player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "First, I'll evaluate the current offer provided by Player 1, which is [1, 0, 1, 3, 1].\n\n1. Calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n   - 0 unit of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n   - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222\n   - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n   - Total value = 40 + 0 + 47 + 222 + 14 = 323\n\n2. Adjust this value for the discount rate, gamma = 0.9, since it's round 2. The present value for me would be:\n   - Present value = 323 \u00d7 0.9 = 290.7\n\n3. Compare this to my outside offer value, which is 680. The present value of the current offer (290.7) is much less than my outside offer (680).\n\nGiven this calculation, I should look to make a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer when adjusted for the discount rate. I need to construct an offer favoring a higher value for me.\n\nSuppose my counteroffer gives Player 1:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 (value to me: 40)\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (value to me: 34)\n   - 1 unit of item 3 (value to me: 47)\n   - 2 units of item 4 (value to me: 148)\n   - 1 unit of item 5 (value to me: 14)\n\nLeaving me with:\n   - 3 units of item 1 (value to me: 120)\n   - 2 units of item 2 (value to me: 68)\n   - 3 units of item 3 (value to me: 141)\n   - 4 units of item 4 (value to me: 296)\n   - 3 units of item 5 (value to me: 42)\n\nThe value to me in this scenario would be:\n   - Total = 120 + 68 + 141 + 296 + 42 = 707\n\nWith the discount factor applied for round 2:\n   - Present value = 707 \u00d7 0.9 = 636.3\n\nThis present value (636.3) is still less than my outside offer of 680.\n\nTo improve this, I should adjust so that the value is closer or exceeds 680. I will reduce the units of highly valuable items like item 4 and increase less valuable items that have less impact.\n\nRevising the counteroffer:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 (value to me: 40)\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (value to me: 34)\n   - 1 unit of item 3 (value to me: 47)\n   - 1 unit of item 4 (value to me: 74)\n   - 3 units of item 5 (value to me: 42)\n\nResulting in:\n   - 3 units of item 1 (value to me: 120)\n   - 2 units of item 2 (value to me: 68)\n   - 3 units of item 3 (value to me: 141)\n   - 5 units of item 4 (value to me: 370)\n   - 1 units of item 5 (value to me: 14)\n\nThe value in this scenario would be:\n   - Total = 120 + 68 + 141 + 370 + 14 = 713\n\nPresent value with discount:\n   - Present value = 713 \u00d7 0.9 = 641.7\n\nThis present value (641.7) is still lower than my outside offer. Ensuring balance I adjust to find a maximum while balancing units.\n\nAfter evaluating different possibilities, my focus is on strategic allocation resulting in acceptable outcomes. The precision does not capture the possibility of fractional adjustments, thus reluctant adjustments for precise comparison.\n\nGiven the analysis, I shall proceed strategically. The counterproposal aligns with balancing outcome equivalently adjusted for optimal matching.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 433. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 48 x 3 + 63 x 2 + 27 x 6 + 53 x 0\n    which is 432 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 433. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that in round 2 my value is multiplied by 0.9 and in round 3 by 0.81.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside option.\n\n3) **Initial Offer Strategy:**\n   I want to propose an offer that gives Player 2 \"enough\" to make them potentially accept it.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 35 x 0 + 83 x 1 + 59 x 0 + 59 x 0\n    which is 83 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 86. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, should I end up counteroffering or if the negotiation continues to further rounds, the value will be subject to a discount.\n\n4. **Decision Based on Comparison:**\n   - Since the current offer value (337) is far below my guaranteed alternative (602), accepting the offer would result in a significant loss of value for me.\n   - Therefore, the rational choice is to decline the offer.\n\n5. **Make a Counteroffer or Walk:**\n   - To maximize my outcome, I should consider a counteroffer that would be more beneficial, but still reasonable enough for Player 1.\n   - Keeping most of the high-value items (item 3 and 5) would be critical due to their high per-unit value to me.\n\n6. **Form a Counteroffer:**\n   - Propose something like giving Player 1 [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]:\n     - This leaves me with [4, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n     - Value to me would then be:\n       - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 18 = 72\n       - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 84 = 84\n     - Total value to me = 72 + 183 + 154 + 14 + 84 = 507\n     - Which though still lower than my outside offer, shows an attempt to move negotiations forward, and can be revised in subsequent rounds if Player 1 does not accept.\n\nSince the calculation shows that the current offer is significantly below my outside offer, and a counteroffer still provides me lower than my outside value, my strategy here would be to increase potential willingness to negotiate further either with better odds on a counteroffer or focusing on a strong opening for subsequent rounds.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

However, I can aim for something better than the current offer. To do this, I can offer slightly less to Player 2. Since I value Item 3, 4, and 5 high, I can try to keep more of those items.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer (valued at 142.2) is much better than my outside offer (86).\n\n*   Considering the possible \"mistakes,\" accepting now is clearly better than walking away (Mistake 5).\n\n*   I will propose a counteroffer that is slightly better for me than the current one for Player 2, taking into account the discounting factor. Let's propose the following:\n    *   Offer Player 2: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    *   Keep for myself: 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n\n    *   My value: 5 * 32 + 4 * 35 + 2 * 83 + 1 * 59 + 2 * 59 = 160 + 140 + 166 + 59 + 118 = 643\n    *   Discounted value = 643 * 0.9 = 578.7.

Therefore, accepting the current offer is not advantageous. I must either make a counteroffer that exceeds my discounted value or walk away.\n\n5. **Possible Counteroffer**:\n   - I should aim for a value greater than my discounted outside offer of 602. \n   - Here's a possible set of items I might retain that maximizes my value:\n     - 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 18 = 54\\)\n     - 3 units of item 2: \\(3 \\times 61 = 183\\)\n     - 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 77 = 154\\)\n     - 1 units of item 4: \\(1 \\times 14 = 14\\)\n     - 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 84 = 168\\)\n   - Total value to me: \\(54 + 183 + 154 + 14 + 168 = 573\\)\n   - Adjust for discount: \\(573 \\times 0.9 = 515.7\\)\n\nSince this potential counteroffer does not even reach the value of my outside offer, and given that negotiations can continue into the third round, I will propose a counteroffer aimed at maximizing my potential value while taking into account that any future counteroffer in the final round will result in a walk:\n\nI'll offer something slightly adjusted to test Player 1's willingness to accept a higher share, aiming closer to my outside value if further rounds were discounted more:\n\n- Counteroffer to get closer to maximizing value:\n\n**Counteroffer Proposed**:\n- I offer Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n- Meaning for me: \n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\nRecalculate:\n- My receiving:\n  - 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\)\n  - 3 units of item 2: \\(3 \\times 61 = 183\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 77 = 77\\)\n  - 1 unit of item 4: \\(1 \\times 14 = 14\\)\n  - 2 unit of item 5: \\(2 \\times 84 = 168\\)\n\nTotal value: \\(90 + 183 + 77 + 14 + 168 = 532\\)\nDiscount Adjusted: \\(532 \\times 0.9 = 478.8\\)\n\n**Deciding Strategy**: The counter satisfies being a better offer in case of acceptance, closer to the external offer I can take, given the possible strategies in the final round.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 35 x 0 + 83 x 1 + 59 x 0 + 59 x 0\n    which is 83 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 86. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 900. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 999 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

I should make a COUNTEROFFER that maximizes the total value for me, taking into consideration the discount factor in the next rounds.\n\nNow let's formulate a counteroffer:\nI should aim for a total value higher than my outside offer. A balanced approach would be to keep a higher number of units of higher-value items (item 3 and item 1 for me) and offer smaller numbers of units of these to Player 1, while offering more of the items that are of lesser value to me. \n\nOffer a counter where I keep more of item 3 (the most valuable to me) and offer more of the lower-value items:\n\nProposed counteroffer to Player 1: [1, 3, 1, 2, 3] - Means:\n- I keep 2 units of item 1, offer 1 to Player 1\n- I keep 3 units of item 2, offer 3 to Player 1\n- I keep 3 units of item 3, offer 1 to Player 1\n- I keep 3 units of item 4, offer 2 to Player 1\n- I keep 3 units of item 5, offer 3 to Player 1\n\nThe calculation for my share would be:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 92 = 276\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n\nTotal value of this distribution to me: 158 + 225 + 276 + 117 + 144 = 920\n\nThis is greater than my outside offer value of 900, which makes it a potentially acceptable offer if anchored to the discount factors and leverage on Player 1's outside offer. \n\nGiven these calculations and potential adjustments in the next round, my decision is to propose this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 2, 3]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 62 x 3 + 83 x 4 + 98 x 4 + 29 x 4\n    which is 1026 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1027. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This means any deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the items, and any deal in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times the value of the items.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 3, 1, 2, 3]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 65 = 65\n    *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 62 = 186\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 83 = 83\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 98 = 196\n    *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 29 = 87\n    *   Total value of current offer: 65 + 186 + 83 + 196 + 87 = 617\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 617 * 0.9 = 555.3\n\nSince 555.3 is less than my outside offer of 1027, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 1027, after being discounted by the current round. It is better to come to an agreement than walking away.\n\nLet's consider keeping all the items and giving none to Player 2. This is:\n    *  3 units of item 1: 3 * 65 = 195\n    *  6 units of item 2: 6 * 62 = 372\n    *  4 units of item 3: 4 * 83 = 332\n    *  5 units of item 4: 5 * 98 = 490\n    *  6 units of item 5: 6 * 29 = 174\n    * Total value: 195 + 372 + 332 + 490 + 174 = 1563\n\nI need to keep items that are valuable to me and offer the rest to the other player.\nI will start with offering close to what the other player offered in round 1. This makes the negotiation more likely to complete.\nOffer: [1, 3, 1, 2, 3] to me.\nI keep:\n    *  2 units of item 1: 2 * 65 = 130\n    *  3 units of item 2: 3 * 62 = 186\n    *  3 units of item 3: 3 * 83 = 249\n    *  3 units of item 4: 3 * 98 = 294\n    *  3 units of item 5: 3 * 29 = 87\n    * Total value: 130 + 186 + 249 + 294 + 87 = 946\nDiscounted value: 946 * 0.9 = 851.4\nThis discounted value is below my outside offer value of 1027.\n\nLet's try a new offer.\nOffer: [0, 2, 0, 1, 3] to Player 2. That means I keep:\n    *  3 units of item 1: 3 * 65 = 195\n    *  4 units of item 2: 4 * 62 = 248\n    *  4 units of item 3: 4 * 83 = 332\n    *  4 units of item 4: 4 * 98 = 392\n    *  3 units of item 5: 3 * 29 = 87\n    * Total value: 195 + 248 + 332 + 392 + 87 = 1254\n    * Discounted value: 1254 * 0.9 = 1128.6\nThis is greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worse than my outside offer. Therefore, I should not accept it.\nA counteroffer of [0, 2, 0, 1, 3] will give me a value of 1128.6, which is better than my outside offer of 1027.

This means the current deal is not better than my outside offer.\n\n3. **Formulate Potential Counteroffer**:\n\n   Objective: Make a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than my outside offer (900) while ensuring it's reasonable for Player 1 to accept.\n\n   Let's assume I take more from the higher-value items to me: items 1 and 3:\n\n   - Proposal: [1, 2, 2, 1, 3] (Where n1=1, n2=2, ..., meaning I offer Player 1 these amounts)\n   - My take:\n     - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 79 = 158\n     - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 75 = 300\n     - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 92 = 184\n     - Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 39 = 156\n     - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 48 = 144\n   - Total value: 158 + 300 + 184 + 156 + 144 = 942\n   - With discount rate: \\(942 \\times 0.9 = 847.8\\)\n\nThough this potential offer gives me less than my outside offer when adjusted for round 2 (847.8 < 900), let's make a better offer to myself to try to exceed my outside offer:\n\n    - New proposal: [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n    - My take:\n      - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 79 = 158\n      - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 75 = 300\n      - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 92 = 276\n      - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 39 = 117\n      - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 48 = 144\n    - Total value: 158 + 300 + 276 + 117 + 144 = 995\n    - With discount rate: \\(995 \\times 0.9 = 895.5\\)\n    - Clearly, this is still less than my outside offer, but it approaches closer. It\u2019s a calculated risk to see if Player 1 accepts.\n\nGiven these analyses, provided a counteroffer wouldn't exceed my outside offer, I'll attempt a more assertive counter, balancing for any chance of better future rounds. Alternatively:\n\n4. **Action Decision**:\n\nSince any offers within reasonable bounds don't surpass my outside offer considering the discount applied, accepting the current offer is not viable compared to my outside value.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1027. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1027. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1011 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 62 x 3 + 83 x 4 + 98 x 4 + 29 x 4\n    which is 1026 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1027. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 1027\n   - Item values: Item 1 = 65, Item 2 = 62, Item 3 = 83, Item 4 = 98, Item 5 = 29\n   - Total items: 3 of item 1, 6 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 6 of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted now is worth more than the same offer accepted later. Since it's round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.81. Since this is the last round, if the other player makes a counteroffer, I'll WALK.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: [1, 3, 2, 2, 2] (what Player 2 is offering me)\n      - Value of current offer: (1 * 65) + (3 * 62) + (2 * 83) + (2 * 98) + (2 * 29) = 65 + 186 + 166 + 196 + 58 = 671\n   - If I accept the current offer in round 3, the discounted value is 671 * (0.9^(3-1)) = 671 * 0.81 = 543.51.  This is much lower than my outside offer of 1027.\n\n   - Potential counteroffers: Let's consider a counteroffer where I keep just enough to exceed my outside offer.\n   - If I kept 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 5 of item 5, that is worth: 0 + 2*62 + 2*83 + 2*98 + 5*29 = 124 + 166 + 196 + 145 = 631.\n   - If I kept 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 5 of item 5, that is worth: 1*65 + 2*62 + 2*83 + 2*98 + 5*29 = 65 + 124 + 166 + 196 + 145 = 696.\n   - If I kept 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 6 of item 5, that is worth: 2*65 + 3*62 + 2*83 + 3*98 + 6*29 = 130 + 186 + 166 + 294 + 174 = 950.\n   - If I kept 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 6 of item 5, that is worth: 2*65 + 4*62 + 3*83 + 3*98 + 6*29 = 130 + 248 + 249 + 294 + 174 = 1095.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is terrible, as the discounted value of accepting it is significantly below my outside offer.\n   - Since it is the final round, and I want a deal, let me offer [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] to player 2. That means I keep [2, 4, 3, 3, 5]. This is worth 2*65 + 4*62 + 3*83 + 3*98 + 5*29 = 130 + 248 + 249 + 294 + 145 = 1066. This is better than my outside offer!\n   - Therefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 401. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 822 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    23 x 2 + 97 x 0 + 44 x 3 + 57 x 2 + 53 x 2\n    which is 398 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 401. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for round 1.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 401\n*   Item values: item 1 = 23, item 2 = 97, item 3 = 44, item 4 = 57, item 5 = 53\n*   Total items: 2 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means waiting for a later round reduces the value of any deal by a factor of 0.9 for each round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: None.\n*   Potential counteroffers: Since I'm the first player, I need to make an offer. I want to offer something that Player 2 might accept, but also leaves me with a value greater than my outside offer. I need to keep in mind Mistake 3: Offering nothing or everything is probably bad at this stage.\n\nLet's try to make a counteroffer that gives player 2 a reasonable amount while keeping enough for myself to be above the outside offer of 401. A good starting point is to try to get the \"better\" items for myself. Let's experiment with allocating more of items 2, 4, and 5 to myself.\n\nI will create several counteroffers, calculate their value, and compare them to my outside offer.\n\n**Counteroffer 1:** Offer [1, 3, 2, 1, 1] to Player 2. This means I keep [1, 3, 2, 1, 1].\nMy value: 1 * 23 + 3 * 97 + 2 * 44 + 1 * 57 + 1 * 53 = 23 + 291 + 88 + 57 + 53 = 512\n\n**Counteroffer 2:** Offer [0, 4, 3, 0, 0] to Player 2. This means I keep [2, 2, 1, 2, 2].\nMy value: 2 * 23 + 2 * 97 + 1 * 44 + 2 * 57 + 2 * 53 = 46 + 194 + 44 + 114 + 106 = 504\n\n**Counteroffer 3:** Offer [0, 5, 2, 0, 1] to Player 2. This means I keep [2, 1, 2, 2, 1].\nMy value: 2 * 23 + 1 * 97 + 2 * 44 + 2 * 57 + 1 * 53 = 46 + 97 + 88 + 114 + 53 = 398\n\nCounteroffer 3 gives me a total value of 398, which is less than the outside offer of 401. This is Mistake 2!\nCounteroffer 1 gives me a total value of 512, and Counteroffer 2 gives me a total value of 504, which are both greater than my outside offer.\n\nI am inclined to select counteroffer 2, as it provides a good number for me.\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince Counteroffer 2 provides good value for me, I will select that.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 3, 0, 1]}\n```",

However, in round 1, there's no discount (because 0.9^0 = 1).\n\n### Decision:\n- **Value of Current Offer**: 517\n- **Outside Offer**: 618\n\nSince 517 (value of current offer) is less than 618 (outside offer), accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n\n### Counteroffer Consideration:\nI need to propose a counteroffer that yields me a value higher than my outside offer. Let's consider keeping more valuable items for myself.\n\n**New Counteroffer Proposal (for Player 1):**\n- Assign fewer valuable items than keeping them to maximize my outcome.\n\nTo ensure the offer to Player 1 is reasonable and beneficial to me, I will propose a counteroffer that increases my value considerably while still being potential for acceptance.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer:\n- **Item 1**: Offer 2 units (I keep 4, 4 \u00d7 51 = 204)\n- **Item 2**: Offer 3 units (I keep 2, 2 \u00d7 18 = 36)\n- **Item 3**: Offer 1 unit (I keep 3, 3 \u00d7 95 = 285)\n- **Item 4**: Offer 0 units (I keep 2, 2 \u00d7 72 = 144)\n- **Item 5**: Offer 2 units (I keep 2, 2 \u00d7 33 = 66)\n\nThe total value I would receive now would be 204 + 36 + 285 + 144 + 66 = 735, which is obviously better than my outside offer.\n\nBy proposing to offer fewer higher valued items, I preserve a larger personal utility.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 75 x 1 + 29 x 0\n    which is 75 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 79. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.9 times its actual value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer (to me): [2, 3, 1, 0, 2]\n    *   This means I get 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer to me: (2 * 63) + (3 * 100) + (1 * 43) + (0 * 75) + (2 * 29) = 126 + 300 + 43 + 0 + 58 = 527\n    *   Discounted value of current offer: 527 * 0.9 = 474.3\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffers:**\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep a minimum acceptable value based on my outside offer value of 79, discounted to round 2 which is equivalent to approximately 88 to the start of the game (88 * 0.9 = 79.2 ~ 79)\nSince I get a discounted value of 474.3 if I ACCEPT this turn, I can aim for getting 474.3 / 0.9 ~ 527 (as that would give me my equivalent)\n\n*   **Counteroffer Consideration 1:** Start by giving the other agent a low number of units of each item and increment from there until you get a value close to your acceptable minimum value.\nThe total units for each item that I have are: 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\nMy values for each item are: 63 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 75 for item 4, 29 for item 5\n\nThe current offer to me is: [2, 3, 1, 0, 2], so it follows that the offer to Player 2 in this turn would be: [(6-2), (5-3), (4-1), (2-0), (4-2)] = [4, 2, 3, 2, 2]\n\nThis turn, I am offering Player 2 the following values of items: item 1: 63, item 2: 100, item 3: 43, item 4: 75, item 5: 29\nSo, if I offer player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the values would be: 6 * 63 + 5 * 100 + 4 * 43 + 2 * 75 + 4 * 29 = 378 + 500 + 172 + 150 + 116 = 1316\n\nI need at least 88 for the game to begin, let's start with the counteroffer: [3, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nWhich means that I will get: [(6-3), (5-2), (4-1), (2-1), (4-1)] = [3, 3, 3, 1, 3]\nMy value would be: 3 * 63 + 3 * 100 + 3 * 43 + 1 * 75 + 3 * 29 = 189 + 300 + 129 + 75 + 87 = 780,\nThis value is greater than the current round's accept value * 0.9.\n\nI will offer [3, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the discounted value of accepting the current offer is 474.3.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 75 x 1 + 29 x 0\n    which is 75 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 79. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 79.\n*   **Item Values:** My values are 63 for item 1, 100 for item 2, 43 for item 3, 75 for item 4, and 29 for item 5.\n*   **Total Items:** There are 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** Gamma is 0.9. Since this is round 3, the discount factor is 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n2) **Value Assessment:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer gives me 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. This means Player 2 would get 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.  My value for the current offer is:\n    (2 \\* 63) + (1 \\* 100) + (0 \\* 43) + (0 \\* 75) + (1 \\* 29) = 126 + 100 + 0 + 0 + 29 = 255.\n    Adjusted by the discount factor: 255 * 0.81 = 206.55\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer, valued at 206.55, is significantly better than my outside offer of 79.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Since the current offer is better than my outside offer, my primary goal isn't just to beat my outside offer, but to see if I can squeeze out a little more value, even if it increases the risk of walking away. However, since this is the last round, there is no point in making a counteroffer, since it will be treated as a walkaway, since player 2 cannot accept a counteroffer in the final round.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n*   Since the current offer is far better than my outside option, the only mistake I could make is walking away from a good deal.\n\nTherefore, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 56 x 3 + 54 x 0 + 67 x 0 + 71 x 1\n    which is 239 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 240. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 1 + 27 x 0 + 89 x 1 + 51 x 4 + 45 x 1\n    which is 387 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 388. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 388\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1: 49, Item 2: 27, Item 3: 89, Item 4: 51, Item 5: 45\n*   **Total pool of items:** 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to both players. In round 3 it will be 0.9^2 times the face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 3, 0, 4, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 4 = 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n\n    My value for this offer is: (2 * 49) + (1 * 27) + (1 * 89) + (0 * 51) + (1 * 45) = 98 + 27 + 89 + 0 + 45 = 259. Adjusted for the round, this offer's value is 259 * 0.9 = 233.1\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (233.1) is significantly lower than my outside offer (388).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value of at least 388 / 0.9 = 431.11.\n    Let's consider a possible scenario where I keep all of items 1, 3, and 5, and divide items 2 and 4. If I keep all of items 1, 3 and 5 my value is (3 * 49) + (1 * 89) + (1 * 45) = 147 + 89 + 45 = 281. I need an additional 431.11 - 281 = 150.11 value from items 2 and 4.\n\n    Suppose I keep 2 units of item 2. This has a value of 2 * 27 = 54, I now need 431.11 - 281 - 54 = 96.11 more value from item 4. I must keep at least 2 units of item 4 to have 2 * 51 = 102 > 96.11.\n    So let me offer Player 2: 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4 and 0 of item 5. My value is (3*49) + (2*27) + (1*89) + (2*51) + (1*45) = 147 + 54 + 89 + 102 + 45 = 437. The discounted value is 437 * 0.9 = 393.3 which is greater than 388.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is bad for me (233.1 < 388).\n*   I should not accept.\n*   I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 3 + 83 x 0 + 78 x 0 + 3 x 1 + 50 x 0\n    which is 57 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 58. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 3 + 83 x 0 + 78 x 0 + 3 x 1 + 50 x 0\n    which is 57 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 58. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 58.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 18, item 2 = 83, item 3 = 78, item 4 = 3, item 5 = 50.\n*   The total pool of items is: item 1 = 6, item 2 = 4, item 3 = 2, item 4 = 4, item 5 = 3.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. Since it's round 2, if we reach an agreement this round, my value will be multiplied by 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [3, 2, 1, 2, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 18 = 54\n    *   2 units of item 2: 2 * 83 = 166\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 78 = 78\n    *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   1 unit of item 5: 1 * 50 = 50\n    *   Total value = 54 + 166 + 78 + 6 + 50 = 354\n    *   Discounted total value = 354 * 0.9 = 318.6\n\n*   Since 318.6 > 58, accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n\n*   **Consider Player 1's previous offer**: [3,0,0,2,0] to Player 2, meaning I would keep [3,4,2,2,3], giving me:\n    *   3 * 18 + 4 * 83 + 2 * 78 + 2 * 3 + 3 * 50\n    *   54 + 332 + 156 + 6 + 150 = 698\n    * Discounted value would be 698 * 0.9 = 628.2. This means I would be better off getting them to accept my initial offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I should explore counteroffers where I offer Player 2 slightly more than in Round 1, since they didn't accept it, but not so much that I make less than 58.\n    *   Let's try offering Player 2 [3, 1, 0, 2, 0]. This would give me:\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 18 = 54\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 83 = 249\n        *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 78 = 156\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 3 = 6\n        *   3 units of item 5: 3 * 50 = 150\n        *   Total value = 54 + 249 + 156 + 6 + 150 = 615\n        * Discounted value = 615 * 0.9 = 553.5\n\n*    Let's try offering Player 2 [3, 1, 0, 2, 1]. This would give me:\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 18 = 54\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 83 = 249\n        *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 78 = 156\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 3 = 6\n        *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 50 = 100\n        *   Total value = 54 + 249 + 156 + 6 + 100 = 565\n        * Discounted value = 565 * 0.9 = 508.5\n\n    *    Let's try offering Player 2 [3, 1, 1, 2, 1]. This would give me:\n        *   3 units of item 1: 3 * 18 = 54\n        *   3 units of item 2: 3 * 83 = 249\n        *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 78 = 78\n        *   2 units of item 4: 2 * 3 = 6\n        *   2 units of item 5: 2 * 50 = 100\n        *   Total value = 54 + 249 + 78 + 6 + 100 = 487\n        * Discounted value = 487 * 0.9 = 438.3\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer of [3, 2, 1, 2, 1] gives me a discounted value of 318.6, which is much better than my outside offer of 58. Offering [3, 1, 0, 2, 0] to Player 2 provides me with a discounted value of 553.5, which is better for me, but there is a chance that player 2 walks away. However, there's a better option for me, which is offering the Round 1 offer, which provides me with a discounted value of 628.2. Given that the other player did not accept the offer, it may be worth trying something in between the two offers.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 605. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 605. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 861 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 7, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 61 x 0 + 37 x 7 + 61 x 1 + 71 x 4\n    which is 604 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 605. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 0, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

Additionally, constructing a counteroffer that keeps higher value items would provide a significantly better total value.\n\nHowever, even the discounted counteroffer value falls short of our guaranteed alternative value due to the outside offer being so high.\n\n### Final Decision\nGiven that any realistic offer or counteroffer at this stage is unlikely to exceed our outside offer due to the high value of the outside offer, the logical choice in this scenario is to walk away and take the sure outside offer benefit of 799.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
