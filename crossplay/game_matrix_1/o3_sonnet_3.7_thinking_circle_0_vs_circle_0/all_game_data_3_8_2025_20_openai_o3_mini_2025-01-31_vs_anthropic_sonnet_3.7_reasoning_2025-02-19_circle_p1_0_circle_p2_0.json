With our private per\u2010unit values\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 1 (2 units): 2\u00d742 = 84\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2 (4 units): 4\u00d718 = 72\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 3 (5 units): 5\u00d779 = 395 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 4 (5 units): 5\u00d761 = 305 \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5 (2 units): 2\u00d74 = 8\n\u2003\u2003Total = 84+72+395+305+8 = 864.\n\u2003\u2003Our outside offer is 757. Thus if no deal is reached we \u201cfall\u2010back\u201d to 757. Consequently any deal must give us more than 757 (when undiscounted, as we are at round 1 with gamma^(0)=1).\n\n2. Our \u201csurplus\u201d is 864 \u2013 757 = 107. In other words, in the negotiation we can at most \u201cgive away\u201d items worth 107 in our own evaluation and still beat disagreement. (Our outcome value equals 864 minus the total \u201ccost\u201d in our own values of what we concede to player 2.)\n\n3. Because we know our own values exactly, we want to keep our high\u2010value items. For us the most valuable items are item 3 (value 79/unit) and item 4 (value 61/unit) \u2013 we want to keep those. We also prefer to keep item 1 (42/unit). Items 2 (18/unit) and 5 (4/unit) are \u201ccheaper\u201d relative to their number of units. Conceding some of these may help induce player 2 to agree while costing us relatively little.\n\n4. One strategy is to offer player 2 the full quantity of items 2 and 5. Conceding:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 18 = 72\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 4 = 8\n\u2003\u2003Total \u201ccost\u201d = 72+8 = 80.\n\u2003\u2003This leaves us with a value of 864 \u2013 80 = 784, which is comfortably above 757 (a surplus of 27). This generous offer on the \u201ccheaper\u201d items may be attractive for player 2 while protecting our high\u2010value items.\n\n5. This offer \u2013 giving player 2 all of items 2 and 5, and keeping all of items 1, 3, and 4 \u2013 is valid (it respects the available quantities) and keeps our own payoff above our disagreement threshold.\n\n6.

The total available quantities are [2, 4, 5, 5, 2]. Thus, if we took everything we would get a \u201craw\u201d (undiscounted) value of:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d742 + 4\u00d718 + 5\u00d779 + 5\u00d761 + 2\u00d74 = 84 + 72 + 395 + 305 + 8 = 864\n\n3. In this negotiation the overall value is multiplied by a discount factor of \u03b3^(round\u20131). We are now in round 2 so any deal reached would have its raw total multiplied by 0.9.\n\n4. Our current outside offer (the \u201cwalk\u2010away\u201d value) is 757, which we get immediately if we choose to WALK. If we were to accept a deal in round 2 then the deal\u2019s raw value would be discounted by 0.9. In order for any deal to beat our 757 outside offer, the raw deal value would have to be more than 757/0.9 \u2248 841.  (Indeed, even getting all items would yield 0.9\u00d7864 = 777.6 which barely exceeds 757.)\n\n5. The current offer on the table (Player 2\u2019s offer to give us [1, 4, 0, 5, 0]) would give us a raw value of:\n\u2003\u20031\u00d742 + 4\u00d718 + 0\u00d779 + 5\u00d761 + 0\u00d74 = 42 + 72 + 0 + 305 = 419\n\u2003Discounted value in round 2: 0.9 \u00d7 419 \u2248 377.1, which is far below our outside offer of 757.\n\n6. In a counteroffer we would aim to capture almost the entire value (since only by obtaining nearly everything could we beat 757 when discounted). However, any counteroffer that gives almost all value to us would likely offer Player 2 too little \u2013 and we don\u2019t have information on his exact values. Such an extreme division may cause him to reject the deal and WALK (or not accept in the next round), leaving us with our outside offer anyway. Negotiation theory suggests that when your reservation value (here, 757) is very high relative to the discounted total value achievable from a deal, pushing for more in the division is very risky.\n\n7. Given that the current offer yields only about 377 discounted and any aggressive counteroffer might risk losing a deal and force us into our high reservation outcome, our best risk\u2013avoiding option is to WALK away and secure our outside offer of 757.\n\nTherefore, our action in Round 2 is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

(Because Player 2\u2019s per\u2010unit values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101, their likely number for item 4 is much higher than my \u201c1.\u201d) In order to make an offer that is acceptable to both sides, I need to \u201csweeten the deal\u201d to Player 2 just enough so that\u2014even if their disagreement (outside) payoff is reasonably high\u2014they will see immediate agreement as attractive.\n\nWith this in mind I choose a counteroffer that transfers to Player 2:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Zero units of item\u202f1 (so I keep all 3 units of item\u202f1, which I value decently).\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Four units of item\u202f2 out of 9 (so I still keep 5 units\u2014and 64 per unit is good for me).\n\u2003\u2022\u2003One unit of item\u202f3 (keeping 2 of 3, noting item\u202f3 is my highest\u2010valued good).\n\u2003\u2022\u2003All 4 units of item\u202f4 (since I value them at only 1 each, but they are likely more attractive to Player\u202f2).\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Three units of item\u202f5 (giving up 3 of 6 units, again sacrificing some \u201cneutral\u201d value to raise the offer).\n\nUnder this division, my retained bundle is:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 1: 3\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 2: 5\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 3: 2\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 4: 0\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item 5: 3\n\nThat gives me my own value of approximately:\n\u20033\u00d754 + 5\u00d764 + 2\u00d771 + 0\u00d71 + 3\u00d764 = 162 + 320 + 142 + 0 + 192 = 816,\nwhich is above my disagreement payoff (744).\n\nFor Player 2, even though I do not know their exact private values, a \u201cgenerous\u201d offer on item 4 (all units) plus a share of some other items (especially items 2, 3, and 5) should \u2013 under many likely draws \u2013 exceed what they could expect from their outside offer. (For example, if we assume they view items 1\u20133 and 5 around 50\u201364 per unit on average and item 4 even higher relative to my value, their total package can reasonably be estimated in a range that competes well with their disagreement.)\n\nThus, my strategy is to propose a Pareto\u2010efficient, nearly \u201csplitting\u2010the\u2010surplus\u201d offer with moderate generosity toward Player 2 while still ensuring I keep a good margin above my own outside option.\n\nBased on this, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 1, 4, 3]}",

That means if I accepted this offer, my \u201cpresent value\u201d would be 0.9 \u00d7 512 \u2248 460.8.\n\nI also have an outside offer of 744 which I can secure immediately by walking away. (Note that walking away gives me the undiscounted outside offer.) So, even without trying to \u201cimprove\u201d the deal further with a counteroffer\u2014and knowing that my earlier offer/skirmishes essentially \u201csplit\u201d the items so that my counterpart in round 1 was aiming for about 827 in face\u2010value (which, discounted in round 2, would be about 744)\u2014I see that any counteroffer that attempts to boost my allocation (so as to reach at least a face value of 827 to get 0.9\u00d7827 \u2248 744) would force me to give the other player nearly what they were already expecting (827 out of 1339 in total face\u2013value). In that case, I\u2019d get 512, which is far below my fallback. In short, any rational counteroffer that gives player 2 enough to make them willing to end the negotiation would leave me with less than what I can guarantee by simply walking away.\n\nGiven that the current deal only nets me about 460.8 (very much below my outside option of 744) and that any counteroffer that might try to get a better \u201csplit\u201d is unlikely to be acceptable to Player 2 (since they can do better by waiting or using their own outside offer), my best action is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

I can choose to \u201csacrifice\u201d (offer to Player\u00a02) units of the items I care least about. In my valuation the per\u2010unit values are: item\u20031 = 9, item\u20032 = 41, item\u20033 = 89, item\u20034 = 7, and item\u20035 = 66. Hence the \u201ccheapest\u201d in my eyes are item\u00a04 (7 per unit) and then item\u00a01 (9 per unit). However there is not enough total quantity in these items to cover 236 if given completely. (3 units of item\u00a01 give 27; 5 units of item\u00a04 give 35; together only 62.) Thus I must also give some of item\u00a02 (worth 41 per unit). In fact, if I give up everything in item\u00a01 (27), everything in item\u00a04 (35), and all of item\u00a02 (4 units \u00d7 41 = 164), that \u201csacrifice\u201d is a total of 27 + 35 + 164 = 226 in my terms.

                    "response": "[Reasoning]\nWe are in round 2. The current offer on the table (from Player 2) gives us [3, 3, 1, 4, 2]. With our private per\u2010unit values (9, 41, 89, 7, 66), this allocation would give us:\n\u2003 item1: 3\u00d79 = 27  \n\u2003 item2: 3\u00d741 = 123  \n\u2003 item3: 1\u00d789 = 89  \n\u2003 item4: 4\u00d77 = 28  \n\u2003 item5: 2\u00d766 = 132  \nfor a total of 27+123+89+28+132 = 399.  \nBut since we are in round 2 the deal is discounted by \u03b3^(r\u20131)=0.9 so its present value is 0.9\u00d7399 \u2248 359.1.\n\nWe also have an outside offer (our \u201creservation\u201d) of 742 (which is not discounted). Clearly 359.1 is far below what we can get by walking away. So we should not ACCEPT the current offer.\n\nIn a counteroffer our goal is to \u201cimprove\u201d our share compared to our outside option. In every deal with discounting the items\u2019 raw value is multiplied by 0.9. Thus we need to secure an outcome that, when discounted at 0.9, beats 742. In other words, our undisc\u00adounted value (the sum of values we get for our own items) should be at least about 742/0.9 \u2248 824.4.\n\nRecall the total value (if we got everything) is 978. In a proposed division we offer Player 2 a bundle (as expressed by an array [x1,x2,x3,x4,x5]) and we get the complement. So our undiscounted payoff is:\n\u2003 978 \u2013 [9\u00b7x1 + 41\u00b7x2 + 89\u00b7x3 + 7\u00b7x4 + 66\u00b7x5].\nTo achieve at least 824.4 for us, we must have\n\u2003 9\u00b7x1 + 41\u00b7x2 + 89\u00b7x3 + 7\u00b7x4 + 66\u00b7x5 \u2264 978 \u2013 824.4 = 153.6.\n\nAt the same time we want Player 2 to see enough \u201cjuice\u201d to prefer a deal in round 2 rather than waiting for round 3 (or walking away into their own outside offer). Because we value differently than they likely do, the standard tactic is to \u201cgive\u201d them items that are cheap for us (i.e. low per\u2011unit cost in our values) even if they might be more highly valued to them. For us the cheapest items are items 1 and 4 (costing 9 and 7 per unit respectively). \n\nA natural idea is to allocate the entire supply of items 1 and 4 to Player 2. That is, x1 = 3 and x4 = 5. The \u201ccost\u201d for us is then 3\u00d79 + 5\u00d77 = 27 + 35 = 62. We then have a \u201cbudget\u201d of about 153.6 \u2013 62 = 91.6 (in our value\u2010units) remaining for any further items we might \u201cgift\u201d to Player 2 so that they prefer the deal over their outside option. \n\nA plausible (and simple) proposal is then to add 2 units of item 2 to Player 2\u2019s allocation. Since item 2 costs us 41 per unit, 2 units cost 82, and the total \u201ccost\u201d becomes 62 + 82 = 144, which is below our 153.6 threshold. \n\nUnder this proposal our counteroffer to Player 2 is:\n\u2003 x1 = 3, x2 = 2, x3 = 0, x4 = 5, x5 = 0.\nThen our own allocation (the complement) is:\n\u2003 item1: 0, item2: (4\u20132)=2, item3: 4, item4: (5\u20135)=0, item5: 6.\nOur undiscounted value becomes:\n\u2003 item2: 2\u00d741 = 82  \n\u2003 item3: 4\u00d789 = 356  \n\u2003 item5: 6\u00d766 = 396  \nfor a total of 82+356+396 = 834.\nDiscounted at 0.9 this is 0.9\u00d7834 = 750.6, which is just above our outside offer of 742.\n\nMeanwhile, Player 2 receives the bundle [3,2,0,5,0]. (Though we do not know their exact private values, giving them all of item 1 and 4 and a couple units of item 2 is likely to be attractive if their outside alternative is uncertain.)\n\nThus, proposing the division: Player 2 gets [3,2,0,5,0] in round 2 seems a plausible counteroffer that improves our result over accepting the current offer. \n\nBased on this reasoning, my action is to make the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 0, 5, 0]}",

                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my reasoning.\n\nMy goal in round\u202f1 is to propose an initial division that gives me a payoff above my outside offer (643) but still \u201cleaves enough\u201d value on the table for Player\u202f2 that they will want to agree quickly rather than risk waiting (especially because waiting reduces the deal\u2019s value by the discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9).\n\nI first calculated my total value if I took every unit:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f1: 7\u00d746 = 322\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f2: 5\u00d739 = 195 \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f3: 4\u00d767 = 268 \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f4: 5\u00d753 = 265 \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f5: 5\u00d725 = 125\n\u2003Total = 1175.\n\n(Recall my outside offer is 643 so any deal must give me more than that.)\n\nI then thought about how many items I can \u201cafford\u201d to keep knowing that if I\u2019m too greedy the other side may get too little value compared to what they might get on their own. Although I do not know Player\u202f2\u2019s exact values, we know each player\u2019s value per unit is drawn from Uniform[1,101] (with an average around 51). If we suppose that on average Player\u202f2\u2019s total would be about 26\u00d751 \u2248 1326 and that their outside offer is drawn uniformly up to that total, on average their outside offer would be roughly half that (about 663). In a \u201cfair\u2010enough\u201d immediate deal the sum of the counts of items given to Player\u202f2 should make their expected value around 663. \n\nBecause there are a total of 26 items across all types, if I \u201ckeep\u201d k items then Player\u202f2 would get (26 \u2013 k) units. To give them roughly 663 in expected value we want:\n\u2003\u200351 \u00d7 (26 \u2013 k) \u2248 663\u2003\u27f9\u200326 \u2013 k \u2248 13\u2003\u27f9\u2003k \u2248 13.\nThat means if I take about 13 units (items) that are most valuable to me I can \u201cafford\u201d to leave the remaining 13 (which on average have a total of about 663 for Player\u202f2) to help induce immediate acceptance.\n\nLooking at my own values, the relative importance is:\n\u2003Item\u202f3 (67) > Item\u202f4 (53) > Item\u202f1 (46) > Item\u202f2 (39) > Item\u202f5 (25).\nI want to retain as many of my best items as possible while \u201cgiving\u201d the opponent the ones I value less. In particular I would like to \u201csacrifice\u201d items that\u2014although they give a good expected value if they are average\u2014don\u2019t contribute as much to my personal total if I keep them.\n\nA natural idea is then to take:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003All of item\u202f3 (4 units) and item\u202f4 (5 units) \u2013 that gives 9 items.\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Then take 4 units of item\u202f1 (since it is my third-best) to add up to 13 total units.\nThat would yield my own payoff as:\n\u2003Item\u202f1: 4\u00d746 = 184  \n\u2003Item\u202f3: 4\u00d767 = 268  \n\u2003Item\u202f4: 5\u00d753 = 265  \nTotal = 184 + 268 + 265 = 717, which is safely above my outside offer.\n\nThe remainder of the items then automatically goes to Player\u202f2:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f1: remaining 3 of 7  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f2: all 5 units  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f3: 0 of 4  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f4: 0 of 5  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u202f5: all 5 units\n\nThus Player\u202f2\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d is:\n\u2003Item\u202f1: 3, Item\u202f2: 5, Item\u202f3: 0, Item\u202f4: 0, Item\u202f5: 5.\n\nUnder an average valuation of about 51 per unit for them, the expected value for Player\u202f2 is roughly 13\u00d751 = 663\u2014which is about what they might expect from an outside offer. That should make the offer attractive enough for Player\u202f2 (especially given discounting in later rounds).\n\nAccordingly, I will now propose this initial division.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 5, 0, 0, 5]}",

                    "response": "I\u2019ll reason as follows. I know that if we end without a deal I get my outside offer of 223 (after no discount in round\u202f1) while Player\u202f2 will get his own outside offer (drawn from a uniform value between 1 and his total\u2010basket value, which in expectation is roughly about half his total potential; given 20 items and an average value of about 51 per unit that \u201ctotal\u201d might be around 20\u00d751 \u22481020, so his outside is around 510 in expectation). In an early agreement (with no discount if concluded now) it is in my interest to \u201csplit the surplus\u201d so that both get at least their disagreement value, but because I have the advantage as proposer I can plan to keep for myself those items where my private valuation is relatively high compared to the \u201caverage\u201d value that Player\u202f2 might expect for any unit. My own private values per unit are: \n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f1 = 24  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f2 = 48  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f3 = 18  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f4 = 1  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003item\u202f5 = 72\n\nNotice that items 1, 3, and 4 are worth relatively little to me (all less than 51, the approximate average value for Player\u202f2) whereas item\u202f5 (and item\u202f2 almost) is especially valuable to me. So it is natural to \u201cbuy\u201d agreement by giving Player\u202f2 the items I don\u2019t care much about: if I allocate to him the entirety of item\u202f1 (1 unit), item\u202f3 (5 units) and item\u202f4 (4 units), that totals 1+5+4 = 10 units. If we imagine that Player\u202f2\u2019s per\u2010unit value is about 51 (on average) then the \u201cpack\u201d I offer him is worth roughly 10\u00d751 = 510\u2014a figure that roughly matches or exceeds his outside offer expectation.\n\nThat leaves me taking the full 6 units of item\u202f2 and all 4 units of item\u202f5. My own value then comes to 6\u00d748 = 288 from item\u202f2 plus 4\u00d772 = 288 from item\u202f5, totaling 576. This is far above my disagreement value of 223. In standard alternating\u2010offers reasoning the proposer will give the opponent just enough to make acceptance rational. Although I don\u2019t know Player\u202f2\u2019s exact private values, offering him items that I value very little and which in expectation will be attractive enough to him (given his likely higher relative value for those items) seems a plausible first offer.\n\nThus, I propose to offer Player 2 the following division (the offer is defined by the number of each item that I give to him):\n\n\u2003item 1: 1 unit  \n\u2003item 2: 0 units  \n\u2003item 3: 5 units  \n\u2003item 4: 4 units  \n\u2003item 5: 0 units\n\nIn the required JSON format, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 5, 4, 0]}",

The current offer is Player 2\u2019s offer \u201c[0, 4, 0, 0, 4]\u201d which means that if accepted you would receive:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 1\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 4 units of item 2\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 3\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 0 units of item 4\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 4 units of item 5\n\n2. Your private value per unit for the items are:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 24\u2003\u2003Item 2: 48\u2003\u2003Item 3: 18\u2003\u2003Item 4: 1\u2003\u2003Item 5: 72\n\n3. The un-discounted value if you accept the current offer is:\n\u2003\u2003Value = (0\u00d724) + (4\u00d748) + (0\u00d718) + (0\u00d71) + (4\u00d772)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 = 0 + 192 + 0 + 0 + 288\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 = 480\n\n4. Since this is Round 2 and the discount factor is applied as gamma^(r-1), the present value is:\n\u2003\u2003Discount factor for round 2 = gamma^(2-1) = 0.9\n\u2003\u2003Present value = 480 \u00d7 0.9 = 432\n\n5. Your outside offer is 223, so accepting yields 432 which is much higher than the outside option.\n\n6. Although you could propose a counteroffer, doing so risks further discounting (down to gamma^2 = 0.81 in a potential round 3) and uncertainty about Player 2\u2019s acceptance. With the current offer giving you a high value of 432 (discounted), it is a good deal.\n\nThus, the best action for you is to ACCEPT the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

So I must get an outcome worth more than 272. In a first\u2010round offer there is no discount yet, so I have full \u201cpie\u201d value. (Player2 will be discounting future rounds at gamma = 0.9 so he is somewhat pressed to agree to a \u201creasonable\u201d offer now.) \n\nBecause I know my item values but not Player2\u2019s, a standard idea is to \u201cgive away\u201d the items that cost me little. Item1 is very low\u2010value (4 each) so I can offer all 7 units to Player2. I still have to \u201cincentivize\u201d him by giving him about the equivalent of roughly 10 units (if one assumes\u2014on average\u2014each unit is worth around 50 for him) so that his total is competitive with his unknown outside offer (which in expectation is around half his total value). Since I want to lose as little as possible from my own perspective I then choose among the remaining items the ones I value less. My next \u201ccheapest\u201d items are item2 (valued 32 each compared to 49 per unit for item3). \n\nOne proposal that meets these considerations is to offer Player2:\n\u2003\u2013 All 7 units of Item1,\n\u2003\u2013 1 unit of Item2,\n\u2003\u2013 and 2 units of Item3,\n\u2003\u2013 while keeping all of item4 and item5 and the rest of item2 and item3 for myself.\n\nChecking this allocation:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Player2 gets a total of 7 + 1 + 2 = 10 units. (If his per\u2010unit values are roughly 50 on average, that bundle is \u201cworth\u201d about 500, which should be competitive with his outside offer.)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003I keep:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item2: 3 \u2013 1 = 2 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item3: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item4: 1 unit,\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item5: 4 units.\n\u2003My total value becomes:\n\u2003\u20032 \u00d7 32 = 64  \n\u2003\u20032 \u00d7 49 = 98  \n\u2003\u20031 \u00d7 61 = 61  \n\u2003\u20034 \u00d7 62 = 248  \n\u2003Total = 64 + 98 + 61 + 248 = 471, which is well above my outside offer (272).\n\nThus, my initial offer gives me a strong payoff while offering Player2 an attractive enough allocation (especially when future rounds would discount any further agreement).\n\nI now provide this offer in the required format.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [7, 1, 2, 0, 0]}",

I know my own per\u2010unit values:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 1: 4\u2003\u2003(item 1 is low\u2010value for me),\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 2: 32,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 3: 49,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 4: 61,\n\u2003\u2022\u2003item 5: 62.\nI thus want to keep the high\u2010value items (items 3, 4, 5) and am happy to hand over the lower\u2010value ones (items 1 and 2). One clear proposal is to give Player\u00a02 everything in items 1 and 2 and leave me with all of items 3, 4 and 5. (Note that total available are [7, 3, 4, 1, 4]; so if I \u201cgive\u201d [7, 3, 0, 0, 0] to Player\u00a02, then I get [0, 0, 4, 1, 4].)\n\nLet\u2019s check my payoff if this deal happens:\n\u2003My allocation = [0, 0, 4, 1, 4] gives an undiscounted value of \n\u2003\u20030\u00d74 + 0\u00d732 + 4\u00d749 + 1\u00d761 + 4\u00d762 = 0 + 0 + 196 + 61 + 248 = 505.\nAfter discounting this round\u2019s value (factor 0.9) the payoff is 0.9\u00d7505 \u2248 454.5, comfortably above my outside offer.\nFor Player 2, even though I don\u2019t know their exact values, giving them all of items 1 and 2 (a total of 10 units) is similar in quantity to what they got in their counteroffer in round\u00a01. Since item 1 is relatively low\u2010value to me, it is plausible that Player\u00a02\u2019s private values won\u2019t make these items unattractive to them. They may well prefer the \u201cpackage\u201d that gives them all of items 1 and 2 rather than waiting for a next round with further discounting.\n\nThus, to improve my outcome over both the current offer and the outside option, my rational counteroffer is to propose awarding Player 2 items [7, 3, 0, 0, 0], keeping for myself the full quantities of items 3, 4 and 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [7, 3, 0, 0, 0]}",

I want to make an initial offer that is likely to be acceptable to Player\u00a02 while ensuring that I secure a payoff well above my fallback of 207.

At the same time I must be cautious not to \u201csting\u201d Player\u00a02 too much\u2014if I offer them too little (by my own metric) they may expect a better deal later or be encouraged to use their outside option (which for them is a random draw with an expected value roughly on the order of half their total item value). \n\nA balancing idea is to aim for a nearly equal split (from my perspective) of the overall pie (746 total value) so that Player\u00a02\u2019s immediate discounted gain from accepting in round\u00a01 is competitive with their likely fallback (discounted future or outside offer).

My \u201cpie\u201d is worth 1433 in total (if I got everything) so I care a lot about the high\u2010value items (item\u00a01 at 91 per unit and item\u00a03 at 90 per unit). In a \u201cfirst\u2010offer\u201d round I want to \u201cconcede\u201d enough so that Player\u00a02 (whose values are unknown but roughly average around 51 per unit on expectation) gets a bundle that should at least beat his outside option. Based on his likely expected full\u2011pie value (roughly 969) his outside offer is on average in the 400\u2013500 range. To encourage him to accept without delaying (thus avoiding discounting later), I want to give him a bundle whose expected worth (to him) is roughly around 500. (For instance, if we assume an average of 51 in each category, then 3 units of item\u00a01 gives \u2248153, plus all 4 units of item\u00a02 gives \u2248204, plus 1 unit of item\u00a03 gives \u224851, plus all 2 units of item\u00a04 gives \u2248102; summing to 510.) This offer leaves me with most of the higher\u2010valued item\u00a01 (4 of 7) and item\u00a03 (5 of 6) so that my own total (4\u00d791 + 5\u00d790 = 364 + 450 = 814) is well above my disagreement payoff.

In any deal I must get at least 515 in my own numbers, so the \u201ccost\u201d (in my own value) of any items I concede must not exceed 42.\n\nBecause my per\u2010unit values differ across items, I want to \u201cspend\u201d as little of my surplus (the 42 extra points) as possible while giving the other party items they are likely to prize. In expectation (with their private value drawn uniformly on [1,101]) the other player \u201cvalues\u201d each unit roughly around 51 on average. Thus, from my perspective the \u201cexchange rate\u201d is best when I give up a unit I value low while potentially handing over something the other player may see as worth about 51. Among my items item\u00a01 is worth only 16 per unit, which is very \u201ccheap\u201d for me (and in expectation the other party may see it as roughly 51 per unit). In contrast, my most\u2010valued item \u2013 item\u00a02 \u2013 is too expensive (77) for me to give away.\n\nI must have my final share satisfy:\n\u2003\u2003557 \u2212 [16\u00b7(# of item\u00a01 I concede) + 77\u00b7(# of item\u00a02) + 42\u00b7(# of item\u00a03) + 44\u00b7(# of item\u00a04) + 33\u00b7(# of item\u00a05)] \u2265 515.\nThus the total \u201ccost\u201d of what I concede must be \u226442. To \u201cspend\u201d as much \u201cbang for my buck\u201d as possible\u2014and since I cannot give fractional items\u2014I see that the best is to give up only item\u00a01\u2019s because 1 unit costs me only 16 while giving the other side (in expectation) around 51 in value. (If I try to concede a unit of any other item I hit a larger \u201ccost\u201d that would drop my own share below 515.) The most I can concede in item\u00a01 is 2 units (since 3 units would cost 48 >42). Giving 2 units of item\u00a01 costs me 2\u00d716 = 32, leaving me with a share valued 557 \u2212 32 = 525\u2014a slight gain (of 10) over my disagreement payoff.\n\nThus my initial offer is to \u201cgive\u201d the other player 2 units of item\u00a01 and keep everything else.

                    "response": "I will explain my reasoning.\n\nStep 1. Note our available items and our own private values:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 units, value 49 each (total 245)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 4 units, value 16 each (total 64)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 2 units, value 1 each (total 2)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3 units, value 64 each (total 192)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 6 units, value 54 each (total 324)\nSo if we got everything our total \u201cpie\u201d is worth 827. We also have an outside option of 406.\n\nStep 2. We know that Player 2\u2019s private per\u2010unit values are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101. Their expected per\u2013unit value is roughly 51. (Note that while we do not know their exact numbers, we reasonably think that if they got all items their expected total would be about 1020, and their private outside option \u2013 drawn uniformly from 1 to 1020 \u2013 will average to about 510; however, because discounting is not yet in effect in round 1 but will become an issue in later rounds, Player 2 will end up preferring a \u201cgood\u2010enough\u201d immediate offer as compared to waiting.)\n\nStep 3. As the first mover, we design our offer in such a way that we \u201cgive\u201d Player 2 an allocation whose expected value is roughly at or just above what they might be able to get later (discounted by gamma = 0.9) or by their outside option, while keeping for ourselves as many of the items we value highly. Since our values vary by item, we want to \u201cconcede\u201d items that are relatively low\u2010worth for us but that \u2014 given the uniform draw \u2014 have a higher marginal expected value for Player 2.\n\nStep 4. Look at our items:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3 is almost valueless for us (only 1 per unit) but for Player 2 the expected value per unit is about 51. Thus it is very \u201ccheap\u201d for us to give away.\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2 is also low from our perspective (16 per unit) while giving the opponent around 51 per unit (in expectation).\nWe can give these away completely.\nSo we set x\u2082 = 4 (all units) and x\u2083 = 2 (all units).\n\nStep 5. With that, Player 2 already gets an expected gain of about\n\u2003\u20034\u00d751 + 2\u00d751 = 204 + 102 = 306.\nThat may not be good enough compared to their likely reservation (~510) but note that if they wait a round the discount (0.9) will bring down their later payoff to around 459 (0.9 \u00d7 510). Thus, if we can \u201ctop\u2010up\u201d the offer by roughly 150 extra expected points, they should be inclined to accept now.\nThe next \u201ccheap\u201d item for us is Item 1: although we value it at 49 per unit, giving one unit means our \u201closs\u201d is 49 while the opponent gains (in expectation) roughly 51. Three extra units (3\u00d751 \u2248 153) would supply nearly 153 extra expected value.\nSo by adding x\u2081 = 3 we can bring the opponent\u2019s expected total value almost to 459 (306 + 3\u00d751 = 306 + 153 = 459), which is roughly equal to what waiting might yield after discounting.\n\nStep 6. We then keep the rest of the items that we value even more (Items 4 and 5) completely.\nThat means set x\u2084 = 0 and x\u2085 = 0.\n\nStep 7. Under this proposed division:\n\u2003\u2013 The offer to Player 2 is: item 1: 3, item 2: 4, item 3: 2, item 4: 0, item 5: 0.\n\u2003\u2013 We keep: item 1: (5\u20133)=2 units, item 2: 0, item 3: 0, item 4: all 3, and item 5: all 6.\nOur own total value then comes to:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d749 + 3\u00d764 + 6\u00d754 = 98 + 192 + 324 = 614,\nwhich is well above our outside option (406).\n\nThis offer is designed to be \u201cjust enough\u201d for Player 2 (with an expected value around 459 in today\u2019s terms) while letting us secure a high-value share.\n\nThus, in round 1 our action is to make the counteroffer with the offer vector [3, 4, 2, 0, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 2, 0, 0]}",

                    "response": "Step 1: We first assess our current \u201cdeal\u2010on the table.\u201d The offer we currently have would give us (as Player\u202f1) a bundle of 4 units of item\u202f1, 0 of item\u202f2, 2 of item\u202f3, 0 of item\u202f4, and 2 of item\u202f5. Using our private per\u2010unit values (49,\u202f16,\u202f1,\u202f64,\u202f54) the raw score from that bundle is\n\n\u2003\u20034\u00d749 + 0\u00d716 + 2\u00d71 + 0\u00d764 + 2\u00d754 = 196 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 108 = 306. \n\nBecause we are now in round 2 (thus discount factor = 0.9) the present\u2010value of that outcome is 306\u00d70.9 = 275.4. This is clearly below our private outside offer of 406; so we would not wish to just accept the current offer.\n\nStep 2: We can counteroffer. In constructing a counteroffer we control what we \u201cgive to\u201d Player\u202f2; our own bundle is the remainder. Our goal is to secure for ourselves a raw (i.e. undiscounted) value that, when discounted by 0.9, beats our outside option. In other words, if we secure a raw value V then we need 0.9\u00d7V \u2265 406, so V must be at least about 451.11. (Since we must use integers and items come in specific quantities, a slightly higher raw score is preferable.)\n\nStep 3: We already know our total possible raw value if we got everything is 827. Thus if we want at least 451 raw for ourselves our \u201ccost\u201d (i.e. the sum of our item\u2010values that we hand over to Player\u202f2) must be no more than 827 \u2013 451 = 376. In choosing an offer we\u2019d like also to \u201csweeten\u201d the deal for Player\u202f2 relative to the current state and previous offers so that they are more inclined to accept.\n\nStep 4: One workable counteroffer is the following. In round\u202f1 we offered to give Player\u202f2 the bundle [3, 4, 2, 0, 0] (leaving ourselves 827 \u2013 213 = 614 raw value by our own valuation) but that was rejected. Their proposal (the current offer on the table) would yield us 306 raw. So we consider a compromise move\u2014a counteroffer that gives us a raw value just above the minimum we need while \u201cimproving\u201d on what Player\u202f2 would have gotten from our earlier (too generous for us) proposal.\n\nA candidate is to offer Player\u202f2 the bundle [4, 4, 2, 0, 2]. Then our own bundle becomes the complement of totals:\n\u2003\u2003For item\u202f1: 5 \u2013 4 = 1\n\u2003\u2003For item\u202f2: 4 \u2013 4 = 0\n\u2003\u2003For item\u202f3: 2 \u2013 2 = 0\n\u2003\u2003For item\u202f4: 3 \u2013 0 = 3\n\u2003\u2003For item\u202f5: 6 \u2013 2 = 4\n\nStep 5: Our raw value for our own bundle is therefore\n\u2003\u20031\u00d749 + 0\u00d716 + 0\u00d71 + 3\u00d764 + 4\u00d754 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 49 + 0 + 0 + 192 + 216 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003= 457.\nWhen discounted by 0.9 (since this is a round\u202f2 agreement), our present value becomes 457\u00d70.9 = 411.3. This beats our outside offer. At the same time the offer to Player\u202f2 (the bundle [4,4,2,0,2]) is substantially different from the current offer on the table and may be attractive enough for them to accept rather than risk a further round with an even lower discount factor.\n\nStep 6: Given that accepting the current offer nets us a discounted 275.4\u2014which is well below our outside offer\u2014and that this counteroffer secures us over 411 in present\u2010value terms, our best move is to COUNTEROFFER with the proposed division.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4,4,2,0,2]}",

(There is no discount yet because we are in round 1.) Equivalently, if I define x\u2081\u2014x\u2085 to be the number of each item I give to Player\u00a02, then my retained value is\n\n\u2003\u2003865 \u2013 [55\u00b7x\u2081 + 54\u00b7x\u2082 + 22\u00b7x\u2083 + 34\u00b7x\u2084 + 27\u00b7x\u2085] \u2265 763.\n\nThat means I can \u201cafford\u201d to give items whose total \u201ccost\u201d (using my valuations) is up to 865 \u2013 763 = 102 points.\n\nIn choosing what to offer to Player\u00a02 it is natural to \u201cspend\u201d my slack on items that cost me little \u2013 items for which my private value is low \u2013 while possibly being appealing to Player\u00a02 (who\u2019s drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 101, so on average his per\u2010unit values are lower than the high numbers I have for items 1 and 2). Of the 5 items, item\u00a03 has a value of only 22 to me (the lowest among the five types). With a \u201cbudget\u201d of 102 points, I can give up at most \u23a3102/22\u23a6 = 4 units of item\u00a03 (since 5 units would \u201ccost\u201d 110, a bit too high) and not exceed my threshold. In that case my \u201ccost\u201d to me is 4\u00d722 = 88, leaving me with 865 \u2013 88 = 777, which is safely above my outside offer. (I could consider splitting the slack among different items but note that every additional unit of any other item has a higher \u201ccost\u201d in my own valuation than 22.)\n\nTherefore, a reasonable initial offer is to offer Player\u00a02 4 units of item\u00a03 (and nothing else) \u2013 that is, letting him have 4 of item 3 while I keep the remaining items.

Adding our full quantities (5, 5, 5, 3, 4) gives a total \u201cface\u2010value\u201d of 865.\n2. However, any deal reached in round 2 is discounted by a factor of 0.9 (since gamma^(r\u20131) with r = 2 equals 0.9). Thus, a deal yielding x face\u2010value is worth 0.9\u00d7x to us.\n3. Our outside offer (the \u201cwalk\u2010away\u201d value) is 763 \u2013 and note that if we walk away, we get that value full (without discounting). Therefore, to prefer any deal over our outside offer we would need 0.9\u00d7(our share) \u2265 763, which implies our share (in face\u2010value terms) must be at least 763/0.9 \u2248 849.\n4. The current offer on the table is Player 2 offering us [1, 1, 5, 1, 1]. That allocation gives us a face value of:\n\u2003\u200355\u00d71 + 54\u00d71 + 22\u00d75 + 34\u00d71 + 27\u00d71 = 55 + 54 + 110 + 34 + 27 = 280.\n\u2003When discounted (0.9\u00d7280), its present value is only 252 \u2014 far below our 763 reservation.\n5. To craft a counteroffer that would get us a face\u2010value of at least 849 would force us to leave only 865 \u2013 849 = 16 face\u2010value for Player 2. Given that Player 2\u2019s own outside offer is drawn from his total value (which on expectation is considerably high), a counteroffer skewed so extremely in our favor would be absolutely unacceptable for him.\n6. If we delay further or try to propose a counteroffer acceptable to both sides, we cannot meet our reservation value (since discounting makes almost any division unattractive compared to our outside offer) while also offering Player 2 enough to beat his own outside option.\n7. Hence, any deal on the table in round 2 is clearly inferior to our outside offer of 763. Rationally, our best move is to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

In our case that means:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 units\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 0 units\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 units\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 units\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 unit\n\nStep 2: Compute our raw (undiscounted) value for the offered bundle using our private per\u2010unit values:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 0 \u00d7 9 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 \u00d7 86 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 2 \u00d7 43 = 86  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1 \u00d7 70 = 70  \nTotal raw value = 128 + 0 + 0 + 86 + 70 = 284\n\nSince we are in Round 2 and the discount factor is \u03b3 = 0.9, if we accept the offer our present\u2010value becomes 0.9 \u00d7 284 = 255.6.\n\nStep 3: Compare with our outside option. Our private outside offer is worth 600 (and this amount is received without any discount). Clearly, 600 is much higher than 255.6. \n\nStep 4: Consider the possibility of a counteroffer. In our counteroffer we could try to change the allocation in our favor. However, even in the best case we could aim for (namely \u2013 getting all items), our raw value would be 617. But when discounted in round 2 that becomes 0.9 \u00d7 617 = 555.3 which is still less than our outside offer of 600. Moreover, if the negotiations extend to round 3, the discount would be even steeper (0.9^(3\u20131) = 0.81) further reducing any deal\u2019s value.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the best action. No conceivable allocation available to us in a round\u20112 deal could yield a present value exceeding our outside offer of 600. Consequently, no matter what counteroffer we craft, a deal agreed now (or in round 3) would be less valuable than simply taking our outside offer.\n\nThus, our best action is to WALK.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I'm thinking along the following lines. We know our total value if we got everything is 398 (5\u00d736 + 5\u00d718 + 57 + 9 + 2\u00d731). Our private outside offer is 100, so any agreement we reach must give us more than 100 (and preferably as high as possible) while still \u201cselling\u201d a deal to Player 2 that is at least as attractive as their own outside offer. We also face discounting (\u03b3 = 0.9 for rounds beyond the first); so it is in both parties\u2019 interest to strike an agreement immediately.\n\nOur private values show that for each item type we have a \u201crelative strength\u201d or \u201crelative disadvantage\u201d compared to what Player 2 might expect. (Though we don\u2019t know Player 2\u2019s exact numbers, since they are drawn uniformly from 1 to 101, we can use averages: roughly 51 per unit.) For example:\n\u2022\u2003Item 1: We value each unit at 36, while Player 2\u2019s average is ~51. This puts us at a relative disadvantage on item 1.\n\u2022\u2003Item 2: We value each unit at only 18 (vs. ~51 for Player 2). We definitely want Player 2 to have these.\n\u2022\u2003Item 3: We value it at 57, which is slightly above an expected 51 for Player 2. We\u2019d like to keep this.\n\u2022\u2003Item 4: Valued by us at 9 versus ~51 for Player 2. It makes sense for Player 2 to have it.\n\u2022\u2003Item 5: Valued 31 for us versus ~51 for Player 2. Again, better for them to have these.\n\nIn light of this, a promising idea is to \u201csell\u201d to Player 2 the items that are relatively more valuable for them (by average) while keeping for ourselves the bundle on which we have some comparative advantage. Thus, one natural division is:\n\u2003\u2013 Give Player 2 every unit of items 2, 4, and 5.\n\u2003\u2013 Keep for ourselves every unit of items 1 and 3.\n\nLet\u2019s check the numbers:\n\u2022\u2003Player 1 would get: all 5 units of item 1 and the single unit of item 3. For us this is 5\u00d736 + 57 = 180 + 57 = 237.\n\u2022\u2003Player 2 would get: all 5 units of item 2, the sole unit of item 4, and both units of item 5. Although we don\u2019t know their exact values, with average estimates that would be roughly: 5\u00d751 + 51 + 2\u00d751 \u2248 255 + 51 + 102 = 408.\n\nPlayer 2\u2019s expected outside offer is drawn uniformly from 1 to their total possible value, so on average it would be about half of that total (~half of 714 if we assume 14 items at an average of ~51). Even if their outside offer turns out to be a bit high, the fact that this deal is available immediately (with no discount) is an advantage. Meanwhile, our 237 far exceeds our outside offer of 100.\n\nThus, this seems like a credible first offer that maximizes our share given our relative \u201cstrengths\u201d while hoping that the immediate and substantial utility for Player 2 encourages acceptance (at least if their private type isn\u2019t extremely high).\n\nI now provide my action in the required JSON format. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 0, 1, 2]}",

Although I do not know their exact per\u2010unit values (they are private; drawn roughly from a uniform 1\u2013101, with an average near 51), it is reasonable to assume that on average their \u201cpie\u201d (the items\u2019 total worth to them) is smaller than mine. In my offer I try to concede the \u201ccheaper\u201d objects from my perspective \u2013 in those items that I value relatively less (or even less than the expected average opponent value) \u2013 while keeping for myself the items where my value is high.\n\n3. Choosing which items to concede:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: I value each unit at 27, which is on the low side relative to the (roughly 51) average the opponent might have. Conceding all 3 units costs me little.\n\u2003\u2022 Items 2 and 3: I have high values (83 and 72, respectively). I would like to keep nearly all of these.\n\u2003\u2022 Items 4 and 5: My values (61 and 56) are close to the typical opponent figure. However, to \u201cbuy\u201d the opponent\u2019s willingness to accept, I may need to concede some of these. In particular, giving a couple more units from these types can help push his expected utility from the offer above what he might get with his outside offer (or later discounted negotiations).\n\n4. A plausible division:\n\u2003I \"give\" an offer specifying what Player 2 will receive; whatever remains goes to me. I want my final allocation to have a value comfortably above my 486 fallback.\n\u2003\u2022 Concede all of item 1 (3 units) \u2013 since I lose little by letting him have these.\n\u2003\u2022 Concede 1 unit of item 2 (thus I keep 5, because they are very valuable for me).\n\u2003\u2022 From the single unit of item 3, I concede nothing.\n\u2003\u2022 From item 4 (4 units total), I concede 2 units.\n\u2003\u2022 From item 5 (2 units total), I concede all 2 units.\n\u2003Let\u2019s check outcomes:\n\n\u2003My allocation becomes:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 3 \u2013 3 = 0 units\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 6 \u2013 1 = 5 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 5 \u00d7 83 = 415\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 1 \u2013 0 = 1 unit\u2003\u2003\u2192 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 4 \u2013 2 = 2 units\u2003\u2003\u2192 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 2 \u2013 2 = 0 units\n\u2003Total my value = 415 + 72 + 122 = 609, which is well above my fallback of 486.\n\n\u2003For Player 2 (using an \u201cexpected\u201d per\u2010unit value near 51 as a rough guide):\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 3 units \u2192 roughly 153\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 1 unit \u2192 roughly 51\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 0 units \u2192 0\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 2 units \u2192 roughly 102\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 2 units \u2192 roughly 102\n\u2003Estimated total \u2248 153 + 51 + 102 + 102 = 408.\n\u2003This number is comparable to what we expect for his private outside offer (and in later rounds that value would be discounted). So from his perspective this offer \u201cmarginally\u201d beats his reservation.\n\n5. Final decision:\n\u2003Based on this reasoning, I choose to propose the following counteroffer in round 1 (remember, the offer is the list of units I\u2019m ceding to Player 2): [3, 1, 0, 2, 2].\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 0, 2, 2]}",

                    "response": "My analysis is as follows.\n\n1. If I ACCEPT the current offer, I\u2019d receive [2,2,0,2,2]. With my private per\u2010unit values (27,83,72,61,56) this yields:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 2\u00d727 = 54  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 2\u00d783 = 166  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 0\u00d772 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 2\u00d761 = 122  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2\u00d756 = 112  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 54+166+0+122+112 = 454.\nBecause we are in round 2 the deal is discounted by \u03b3^(2\u20131)=0.9 so the effective value is 0.9\u00d7454 \u2248 408.6. This is below my outside offer of 486, so accepting is not (myself) attractive.\n\n2. I now consider a counteroffer. In our protocol when I counteroffer I specify a bundle to give to Player 2; I will receive the remaining units. (For example, if I offer [a\u2081,a\u2082,a\u2083,a\u2084,a\u2085] to Player 2 then my share is [ total\u2081\u2013a\u2081, total\u2082\u2013a\u2082,\u2026].)\n\n3. Given I need my \u201craw\u201d (undiscounted) value to be at least about 540 to beat my outside option after discounting (since 0.9\u00d7540 = 486), I want my allocation to yield around 540 or a bit more. At the same time I want to leave Player 2 a bundle that is not too \u201cstingy\u201d (so that he is induced to accept rather than expect a better result later). \n\n4. One plausible allocation for me is to \u201caim\u201d for a raw value of roughly 550. For example, if I try to get\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 0 units of item 1 (worth 27 each),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 3 units of item 2 (83 each \u2192 249),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 1 unit of item 3 (72),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 2 units of item 4 (61 each \u2192 122),\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 2 units of item 5 (56 each \u2192 112),\nthen my raw sum becomes 249+72+122+112 = 555. (0 units from item 1 contribute 0, so total 555.) Discounted by factor 0.9 this becomes 555\u00d70.9 = 499.5, which beats my outside offer of 486.\n\n5. Under this proposed division my partner would get the rest:\n\u2003\u2003Item 1: 3 \u2013 0 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003Item 2: 6 \u2013 3 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003Item 3: 1 \u2013 1 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003Item 4: 4 \u2013 2 = 2  \n\u2003\u2003Item 5: 2 \u2013 2 = 0  \nso Player 2\u2019s bundle would be [3, 3, 0, 2, 0]. (Note that the numbers all obey the available inventory.)\n\n6. Compared to the current offer on the table\u2014in which if I accepted I\u2019d get [2,2,0,2,2] (and hence Player 2 would get [1,4,1,2,0])\u2014my counteroffer shifts more of the low\u2013value item (for me) to Player 2 (all of item 1) while claiming most of the high\u2013value items (items 2,3, and keeping all of item 5). I believe this division improves my payoff (well above my disagreement level) while still potentially being acceptable to Player 2 if his private valuations are not extremely different.\n\n7. Because the current offer yields an effective payoff of only about 409 for me\u2014well below my outside offer\u2014I must try a counteroffer and hence my action is to propose a new division.\n\nThus, I now COUNTEROFFER with a proposal that gives Player 2 the bundle [3, 3, 0, 2, 0] (and I would keep the remaining items). \n\nMy response is therefore:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 0, 2, 0]}",

That package would be worth to you (un-discounted) as follows:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 2\u00d727 = 54  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2\u00d783 = 166  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0\u00d772 = 0  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 1\u00d761 = 61  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 1\u00d756 = 56  \n\u2003Total = 54 + 166 + 0 + 61 + 56 = 337.\n\nBecause we are in the third round the outcome is multiplied by gamma^(3\u20131) = 0.9\u00b2 = 0.81. That makes your present value roughly 337\u00d70.81 \u2248 273. By contrast, your outside offer guarantees you 486 (and the outside offer is not discounted). In other words, even if you were to get the deal now, its discounted value is much lower than the safe fallback of 486.\n\nIt is possible to propose a counteroffer where you give up goods you value less (such as item 1, for which you only get 27 per unit) in order to take more of the goods you value more (for example items 2, 3, etc.) so as to bring your un\u2010discounted value above 600 (since 600\u00d70.81 \u2248486 and that would barely match your fallback). However, to make any counteroffer acceptable to Player 2 the offer would have to give him a share in un\u2010discounted terms that, when multiplied by the discount factor, is at least as high as his own outside offer. Since you have no information about Player 2\u2019s private values and outside offer and because his expected alternatives are likely not far below his walk-away value, any counteroffer you try to design to improve your share from 337 (even if rebalanced toward your higher\u2010value items) runs a high risk that Player 2 will reject it\u2014leading to the fallback where you get 486 but with the counteroffer procedure introducing more uncertainty. \n\nGiven that:\n\u20031. The current offer gives you only \u2248273 discounted value.\n\u20032. Any counteroffer that might raise your undiscounted payoff sufficiently (i.e. above 600) is very unlikely to be acceptable to Player 2.\n\u20033. Your outside offer is known and is a safe option at 486 (undiscounted, hence better than any deal discounted by 0.81 that comes to less than 600 undisc. value for you).\n\nThe most rational action in this state is to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "I'll explain my reasoning first.\n\nMy objective as Player 1 is to secure as high a share of the total value as possible while giving Player 2 just enough so that they are at least as well off accepting now as \u201cwaiting\u201d (and possibly getting their uncertain outside offer or a discounted future deal). I know my own values per item (item 1: 36, item 2: 95, item 3: 2, item 4: 9, item 5: 70) and that my full\u2010package value is 1343. I also know my outside option is 364, so any deal must yield more for me than that. In a setting with three rounds and a discount factor of 0.9 per additional round, delaying is costly for both players. (Player 2\u2019s values are private, but since they come from a uniform [1,101] distribution their expected per\u2010unit value is roughly 51; while not precise, that gives an approximate idea of what might be \u201cfair.\u201d)\n\nI aim to keep as much of the items where my value is high (especially items 2 and 5) and am willing to concede items where my own value is relatively lower (items 3 and 4). For item 1 where my value is moderately high I also let Player 2 have only a small portion. In light of that I propose:\n\u2003\u2022 Give Player 2 1 unit of item\u202f1 (so I keep 5),\n\u2003\u2022 Give them 2 units of item\u202f2 (I keep 5 out of 7),\n\u2003\u2022 Give them all 3 units of item\u202f3 (my own value there is very low),\n\u2003\u2022 Give them all 4 units of item\u202f4 (again, my value is modest),\n\u2003\u2022 And give them 2 units of item\u202f5 (so I keep 4 out of 6).\n  \nThat offer gives Player 2 a bundle whose total \u201cexpected\u201d value (if their per\u2011unit average is around 51) comes to roughly (1+2+3+4+2)\u00d751 \u2248 12\u00d751 \u2248 612. This looks competitive compared to a potential outside offer (and any future discounted deal) while allowing me to keep a reasonably high self\u2010value. My resulting take\u2010home bundle would be:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 5 units (5\u00d736 = 180)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 5 units (5\u00d795 = 475)\n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 0 units\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4 units (4\u00d770 = 280)\n\u2003\u2003Totaling 180 + 475 + 280 = 935, which is well above my outside offer.\n\nThus, as my initial move in this negotiation I propose the following division on the table.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]}",

(My outside option is 364, so 423.9 is better\u2014but I might be able to do better by adjusting the split.)\n\nRemember that the items available are: [6,7,3,4,6] for items 1\u20135 respectively. In a counteroffer I get to \u201cset\u201d what I hand over to Player 2 (with me receiving the remainder). My own interests are strongest in items whose per\u2010unit values are highest to me. I value item2 at 95 and item5 at 70. In the current deal my share in those comes out as 7\u20132=5 units of item2 and 6\u20132=4 units of item5 if I accept (because Player2\u2019s offer [3,2,3,3,2] implies I get that many and they get the complement). I would prefer to secure almost all of items 2 and 5 for myself. In contrast, I don\u2019t care much for items 3 and 4 (values 2 and 9). Thus, if I can \u201ctrade\u201d a few extra units of items 3 and 4 (or even of item1, which is moderate at 36) to Player 2, I can keep more of the prized item2 and item5.\n\nFor example, consider proposing that Player 2 get\n\u2003\u2003item1: 4 units (instead of 3)  \n\u2003\u2003item2: 4 units (instead of 5 in the current complementary split)  \n\u2003\u2003item3: all 3 units (current offer gave them 0)  \n\u2003\u2003item4: 3 units (up from 1)  \n\u2003\u2003item5: 3 units (down from 4)\n\nThis is a valid offer since for every item the offered number is at most the total available:\n\u2003\u2003Item totals: [6,7,3,4,6]\n\nThus my allocation from such a counteroffer would be the remainder:\n\u2003\u2003item1: 6\u20134 = 2  \n\u2003\u2003item2: 7\u20134 = 3  \n\u2003\u2003item3: 3\u20133 = 0  \n\u2003\u2003item4: 4\u20133 = 1  \n\u2003\u2003item5: 6\u20133 = 3\n\nMy raw value from that allocation would be:\n\u2003\u20032\u00d736 + 3\u00d795 + 0\u00d72 + 1\u00d79 + 3\u00d770 = 72 + 285 + 0 + 9 + 210 = 576.\n\nWhen discounted by gamma = 0.9 in round 2, that becomes about 576\u00d70.9 = 518.4. (That is substantially better for me than accepting the current proposal at an effective value of ~424.)\n\nI have to keep in mind that Player 2\u2019s unknown private values might be higher for some items.

                    "response": "I will try to explain my thinking briefly. (Note that without knowing Player\u00a02\u2019s private values the \u201cright\u201d division is uncertain, so I have to \u201cguess\u201d a division that (a) leaves me well above my outside value (91) and (b) gives Player\u00a02 enough \u201cstuff\u201d so that they might well prefer accepting this deal over waiting\u2014with discounting and the possibility to \u201ccounter\u201d later.) \n\nMy total value for all items is 1269, so if I got everything I\u2019d get 1269. A \u201cfair\u2010looking\u201d (but by no means unique) split from my own perspective might be a roughly 55% versus 45% division of value. (My outside option of 91 is very low compared to 1269 so I have room to \u201cfight\u201d over items\u2014but little is known about Player\u00a02\u2019s fallback; indeed if their private values turn out high they might have a better outside option. In many alternating\u2013offer games the responder\u2019s continuation value is enhanced by discounting, so I would need to \u201cgive away\u201d some of the surplus to get agreement immediately.)\n\nA natural idea is to try to \u201coffload\u201d some of the lower\u2013value items for me (items where my per\u2013unit value is low: item\u00a01 is 24 and item\u00a03 is 33) to Player\u00a02, while keeping many of the higher\u2013value items (items\u00a04 and 5, worth 72 and 92, respectively). One rough possibility is to propose that Player\u00a02 get two or three units on each item so that, when the pieces add up, I keep a bundle which by my own numbers is worth roughly 700 and they get a bundle (by my own measure) of a little under 600. (This \u201cunequal\u201d division may be necessary if I suspect that given the game\u2019s structure\u2014discounting plus the possibility that their outside offer may be relatively high\u2014Player\u00a02 will reject a bargain that gives them too little.)\n\nFor example, consider the following proposal. (Remember: the offer I submit is the bundle that Player\u00a02 will receive; I get what remains.) Suppose I offer Player\u00a02 the following allocation:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a01 (5 units total): 2 units to Player\u00a02 (so I get 3)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a02 (2 units total): 1 unit to Player\u00a02 (I get 1)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a03 (3 units total): 1 unit to Player\u00a02 (I get 2)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a04 (5 units total): 2 units to Player\u00a02 (I get 3)\n\u2003\u2022\u2003Item\u00a05 (6 units total): 3 units to Player\u00a02 (I get 3)\n\nIn my own valuation this gives me:\n\u2003Item\u00a01:\u20033 \u00d7 24 = 72  \n\u2003Item\u00a02:\u20031 \u00d7 69 = 69  \n\u2003Item\u00a03:\u20032 \u00d7 33 = 66  \n\u2003Item\u00a04:\u20033 \u00d7 72 = 216  \n\u2003Item\u00a05:\u20033 \u00d7 92 = 276  \nTotal = 72 + 69 + 66 + 216 + 276 = 699\n\nAnd by my own \u201clens\u201d the offer gives Player\u00a02 (if we roughly assume their per\u2013unit values average about 51) an expected total roughly:\n\u2003Item\u00a01:\u20032 \u00d7 ~51 = 102  \n\u2003Item\u00a02:\u20031 \u00d7 ~51 = 51  \n\u2003Item\u00a03:\u20031 \u00d7 ~51 = 51  \n\u2003Item\u00a04:\u20032 \u00d7 ~51 = 102  \n\u2003Item\u00a05:\u20033 \u00d7 ~51 = 153  \nTotal \u2248 102 + 51 + 51 + 102 + 153 = 459\n\nGiven the uncertainty on Player\u00a02\u2019s true private values, this \u201cbalanced\u201d offer (giving me about 699 versus about 459 in my scale) is an initial probe. (It is not as favorable for Player\u00a02 as they might want if their outside option is high, but I am the first mover and I can adjust in later rounds.) \n\nThus, in round\u00a01 I will offer the bundle in the requested format. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]}",

(If negotiations fail, I get 202.)\n\u2022 The negotiation discount factor is gamma = 0.9 per round beyond round 1 (so in round 1 the deal is undiscounted).\n\u2022 I must make an initial offer: a division that states how many units of each item I propose to give Player 2.\n\u2022 What Player 2 ultimately values (and their outside offer) is unknown to me. But I can \u201cwin\u201d by designing an offer that helps me get most of the items I especially value while leaving them just enough such that, in expectation, a risk\u2010averse rational opponent (fearing discounting in later rounds and uncertainty in their outside offer) would prefer to accept now rather than risk a delay.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 My Item Preferences:\nLooking at my values:\n\u2003\u2022 I really value items 1, 4, and 5 (83, 83, and 73 per unit, respectively).\n\u2003\u2022 I value items 2 and 3 relatively less (28 and 40 per unit).\nTo maximize my own payoff while still leaving Player 2 an attractive offer, I want to keep nearly all of the items I value highly and be generous with those I value less.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Formulating a Reasonable Initial Offer:\nA straightforward idea is to give Player 2 nearly all of items 2 and 3:\n\u2003\u2022 Offer all 5 units of Item 2.\n\u2003\u2022 Offer all 9 units of Item 3.\nFor the items I value highly, I reserve them for myself:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: I keep all 4 units.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: I keep the 1 unit.\n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: I keep all 5 units.\nWith this offer:\n\u2003\u2022 My allocation becomes: [4, 0, 0, 1, 5].\n\u2003\u2022 My resulting utility computes as:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 4 \u00d7 83 = 332\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 1 \u00d7 83 = 83\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 5 \u00d7 73 = 365 \n\u2003\u2003Total = 332 + 83 + 365 = 780.\n\u2003\u2022 Player 2\u2019s proposed allocation is [0, 5, 9, 0, 0].\nI assume that\u2014if Player 2\u2019s private per\u2010unit values are roughly \u201caverage\u201d (around 51, the midpoint of [1,101])\u2014then their approximate utility would be:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 5 \u00d7 51 = 255\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 9 \u00d7 51 = 459\n\u2003\u2003Total = 255 + 459 = 714.\nThis offer gives them a solid bundle (much above my outside offer of 202, and likely competitive relative to what they might fear if the negotiations drag on and discounting occurs). At the same time, I keep nearly all of the high\u2010valued items.\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Conclusion:\nIn an initial round where time discounting is not yet an issue and given uncertainty about Player 2\u2019s exact values and fallback, this is a credible offer that exploits the asymmetry in my preferences versus the items in which I have less interest.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make the following offer:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 9, 0, 0]}",

The table currently gives me [1,4,8,0,1] (so I\u2019d get one unit of item\u202f1, four of item\u202f2, eight of item\u202f3, none of item\u202f4, and one of item\u202f5). My own valuations per unit are very skewed: I attach high value to items 1 (83), 4 (83) and item 5 (73) while items 2 (28) and 3 (40) are relatively lower\u2010value for me. Under the current offer I\u2019d \u201cearn\u201d a gross value of \n\n\u2003\u20031\u00d783 + 4\u00d728 + 8\u00d740 + 0\u00d783 + 1\u00d773 = 83 + 112 + 320 + 0 + 73 = 588.\n\nBecause we\u2019re in round\u00a02 the discount factor 0.9 reduces that \u201cimmediate\u201d deal to 588\u00d70.9 = 529.2 in present terms. (Note that if we waited until round\u00a03 any deal would be discounted by 0.9\u00b2 = 0.81 so even a better gross allocation would be worth less in present\u2010value terms.) Also, my outside option is only 202.\n\nLooking at my own value structure I\u2019d very much like to have full control over items that I value greatly. For instance, I\u2019d like to secure all of item\u202f1 and the sole unit of item\u202f4. (In the current offer I\u2019d only get 1 of item\u202f1 and none of item\u202f4.) My earlier proposal in round\u00a01 essentially left those \u201cgood\u201d items to me (when I offered [0,5,9,0,0]\u2014which would have given me the complement [4,0,0,1,5] worth 4\u00d783 + 1\u00d783 + 5\u00d773 = 780), but Player\u00a02\u2019s counteroffer moved the deal away from that extreme. \n\nI therefore considered \u201csplitting the difference.\u201d I can propose a new allocation by offering Player\u00a02 a bundle that is a bit closer to what they currently would get (namely, the complement of [1,4,8,0,1] is [3,1,1,1,4]) while still shifting a few high\u2010value items to me. One option I found is to propose that I give Player\u00a02 the bundle [1,5,8,0,0]. Under that division the totals work out as follows (recall the total quantities available on items 1\u20135 are [4,5,9,1,5]):\n\n\u2003\u2022\u2003I offer Player\u00a02:\u2003[1, 5, 8, 0, 0].  \n\u2003\u2022\u2003Then my own bundle becomes: [4\u20131, 5\u20135, 9\u20138, 1\u20130, 5\u20130] = [3, 0, 1, 1, 5].  \n\nMy gross value then is:\n\u2003\u20033\u00d783 + 0\u00d728 + 1\u00d740 + 1\u00d783 + 5\u00d773  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003 = 249 + 0 + 40 + 83 + 365  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003 = 737.\n\nDiscounted in round\u00a02 this becomes 737\u00d70.9 = 663.3\u2014substantially better than the 529.2 I\u2019d get from accepting the current offer. \n\nWhat about Player\u00a02? Under the current proposal they\u2019d have ended up with [3,1,1,1,4], but with my counteroffer they would receive [1,5,8,0,0]. In expectation (given uniformly drawn private values) this shift means they would trade off getting fewer units of item\u202f1 (and not getting item\u202f4) for additional quantity of items 2 and 3. For many possible private valuations on their side this looks like an attractive deal\u2014especially since it promises a large \u201cquantity bonus\u201d on items that (from my side) I know aren\u2019t particularly dear. (Of course there is uncertainty from their point of view, but if they are even modestly responsive they should see some benefit to closing a deal now rather than letting the discount bite further.)\n\nGiven the improvement in my own present\u2010value and the possibility that Player\u00a02 will view this as an acceptable compromise, I am going to counteroffer with [1, 5, 8, 0, 0].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 8, 0, 0]}",

                    "response": "My reasoning is as follows. My total value for all items is 568, and my private \u201coutside offer\u201d guarantees me 472 if I quit negotiations. In any deal I make I must receive an allocation whose items (as valued by my private numbers) total at least 472. That means I can \u201csacrifice\u201d at most 96 points of value from the full 568. In other words, if I concede items to Player\u00a02, the items I give away can have a total \u201ccost\u201d (using my own per\u2010unit values) of no more than 96; if I concede more I\u2019d be \u201cworse off\u201d than simply taking my outside offer.\n\nFor example, note the following:\n\u2003\u2022 Item\u00a03 is worth 18 per unit for me but on average is worth roughly 51 per unit to an opponent (since their per\u2013unit value is drawn uniformly between 1 and 101). Thus, if I \u201cgive up\u201d one unit of item\u00a03 I lose 18 points but the opponent, if his draw turns out near average, \u201cgains\u201d about 51.\n\u2003\u2022 Similarly, item\u00a04 is 25 for me and averages 51 for Player\u00a02;\n\u2003\u2022 In contrast, my high\u2010value items (item\u00a02 at 100, and even item\u00a05 at 61) are too \u201cexpensive\u201d to concede because every unit given to Player\u00a02 would cost me too much relative to the likely gain for him.\n\nEven if I use my \u201cconcession budget\u201d as efficiently as possible (by giving away all units of item\u00a03, which cost 18 each) I would be giving away at most 4\u00d718 = 72 points of my own value. That means Player\u00a02 would receive at most 4 units of item\u00a03 and, in expectation (when multiplied by an average of 51 per unit) his \u201callocated\u2010value\u201d would be around 204. (I can try combinations with items 3, 4, or even 1, but the arithmetic shows that when keeping my own retained value at or above 472, I cannot \u201cspend\u201d more than 96 of my value\u2014and the most efficient items (item\u00a03 has cost 18 per unit) can at best give up 4 units, totaling an expected gain of about 204 for Player\u00a02.)\n\nYet on average Player\u00a02\u2019s overall total value of all items (if he got everything) would be about 714 (since for each of the 14 total units the average value is about 51) and his outside offer \u2013 drawn uniformly between 1 and his total \u2013 would then be around 357 in expectation. In other words, no matter how I \u201ctry\u201d to impress him with a concession within the limit that leaves me at least 472 in hand, the maximum expected benefit I can convey is far below his likely reservation value. (Any attempt to give him even more would force me to drop below my safe outside offer.)\n\nBecause I cannot \u201cbridge the gap\u201d to provide Player\u00a02 with an allocation that likely exceeds his own outside option without reducing my own allocation below 472 (and thus worse than simply accepting my outside offer), a rational, risk\u2010averse strategy is not to negotiate now. In other words, by \u201cwalking away\u201d from negotiations I guarantee myself my outside offer of 472 rather than risk a deal that in almost every situation would be rejected or, if later accepted, come in at an even lower (discounted) value.\n\nTherefore, my action now is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

In choosing which items to concede, I note that my per\u2010unit values are lowest for item\u00a03 (9 per unit) and then item\u00a02 (15 per unit). These items are \u201ccheap\u201d to me, so I want to offer them to Player\u00a02.\n\nOne possibility is to give Player\u00a02 the entire unit of item\u00a02 and a few units of item\u00a03. For example, if I concede 1 unit of item\u00a02 (costing me 15) and 3 units of item\u00a03 (costing me 3\u00d79 = 27), my total concession is 15 + 27 = 42.

In round 2 a deal would have its value discounted by \u03b3 = 0.9 (since discounting is applied as \u03b3^(round\u20131) so round 2 gives a multiplier of 0.9).\n\nThe current offer on the table (from Player 2) gives me [2, 1, 2, 0, 0]. My share\u2019s undiscounted value would be:\n\u2003\u20032\u00b743 + 1\u00b715 + 2\u00b79 + 0\u00b724 + 0\u00b768 = 86 + 15 + 18 = 119.\nDiscounted to round 2 that is 0.9 \u00d7 119 \u2248 107.1\u2014far below my outside offer of 225.\n\nIn a counteroffer I can \u201coffer\u201d Player 2 some items and keep the rest. In doing so I must insure that the deal I reach gives me (undiscounted) at least 250 in value (since 0.9\u00d7250 \u2248225) so it beats or at least ties my fallback.\nHowever, given that my total is 271, I have only 21 \u201cvalue\u2010slack\u201d to give up. I would want to give away items that I care about the least (item 3 is my lowest\u2013worth only 9 per unit). For example, if I were to concede 2 units of item 3 (a cost of 2\u00d79 = 18) then my share would be 271 \u2013 18 = 253 (discounted to 227.7). But then Player 2\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d (what I\u2019m giving up) would be [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]. Compared with their own previous offer (which would let them have more of item 3, plus additional items from the leftovers), such a counteroffer is very unattractive to them. (I have no way of knowing their actual private values, but the outside offer mechanism means they too have a fallback and their expected \u201coutside\u201d value is likely much higher than what a token [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] would give.)\n\nThus, any counteroffer I attempt that \u201cbeats\u201d my own outside offer would have to sacrifice so little (only 21 value units out of 271) that it leaves Player 2 with only a marginal allocation. In the current situation Player 2\u2019s previous offer (giving me [2,1,2,0,0] and keeping almost everything else) is far less attractive for me, but it almost certainly is much better for them than almost any counteroffer I could craft without endangering my own discounted value (which must be at least 225).\n\nBecause:\n\u2003\u2013 Accepting the current offer would yield me only about 107 in present\u2010value.\n\u2003\u2013 Making a counteroffer within my \u201csafety margin\u201d leads to a proposal that is almost surely unacceptable to Player 2 (given their likely outside offer, and the fact they fetched a far \u201cgenerous\u201d allocation for themselves in round 1).\n\u2003\u2013 And if we fail to reach an agreement in round 2 then we run into round 3 where the discount is even steeper (0.9\u00b2 = 0.81) and, in addition, if Player 2 counteroffers then it counts as a WALK on their side.\n\nIn short, if I try to negotiate a deal in round 2 I can only hope for an outcome that gives me less than my safe outside offer of 225. Thus, the best action available is to WALK away and take my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "Step 1: My \u201cpie\u201d (i.e. the total value of all items to me) is 612, with my private values:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 1\u00d774 = 74  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: 2\u00d710 = 20  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 6\u00d760 = 360  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: 3\u00d730 = 90  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: 4\u00d717 = 68  \nThus, my total = 612, and my outside offer is 400. This means any deal I accept must yield me at least 400 points (undiscounted in round 1).\n\nStep 2: Although I do not know Player 2\u2019s true per\u2010unit values, we know each of their values is drawn uniformly from 1 to 101 so that the expected per\u2010unit value is about 51. (For example, the expected full value if they got every unit would be roughly 16\u00d751 = 816; indeed, their outside offer is drawn between 1 and that total.)\n\nStep 3: As the offer-maker, I can \u201cdesign\u201d the division. I want to keep those items that are highly valuable to me and offer Player 2 items that I value less but that\u2014on average\u2014should be reasonably attractive to them. My personal ranking is:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 1: 74 per unit (very high)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 3: 60 per unit (high)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 4: 30 per unit (moderate)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 17 per unit (low)\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 10 per unit (lowest)\n\nStep 4: In light of my fallback of 400 versus a full pie of 612, I must secure at least 400 for myself. At the same time I want Player 2 to receive roughly an \u201cacceptable\u201d share relative to what they might get if they walked away (their outside offer is drawn from [1, Total] and its expected value is near 408). A strategy is to let Player 2 have items I value little but which\u2014given their likely average per\u2010unit value of 51\u2014deliver them expected value near or above 408.\n\nStep 5: Notice that item 2 (2 units), item 5 (4 units) are the least important for me. In expected terms, if I give Player 2 these:\n\u2003\u2013 Item 2: 2\u00d751 \u2248 102  \n\u2003\u2013 Item 5: 4\u00d751 \u2248 204  \nTotal \u2248 306.\u2003This is a bit short of what we think Player 2 might need for acceptance. Adding all of item 4 (3 units) adds roughly 3\u00d751 \u2248 153; making the total about 459 (306+153), which is comfortably above an expected fallback.\n\nStep 6: Under this proposal, Player 2 would receive:\n\u2003\u2022 Item 1: 0 (I keep the 1 unit worth 74 to me)  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 2: all 2 units (worth 10 each to me, total 20)  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 3: 0 (I want all 6 because they yield 360 to me)  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 4: all 3 units (worth 30 each to me, total 90)  \n\u2003\u2022 Item 5: all 4 units (worth 17 each to me, total 68)\nThis yields for me: keeping items 1 and 3 gives 74 + 360 = 434, higher than my fallback 400.\nPlayer 2, by the \u201caverage value\u201d expectation, gets roughly (2+3+4)\u00d751 = 9\u00d751 = 459, which seems acceptable.\n\nStep 7: Since this offer is a valid division of the items (it does not exceed available units for any item) and meets both our reservation concerns (I get 434, above my fallback; Player 2 gets an offer with expected value around 459), I will propose it as my initial offer.\n\nThus, my action in round 1 is to make a counteroffer giving Player 2: [0, 2, 0, 3, 4].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 3, 4]}",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I\u2019ll explain my reasoning first.\n\nStep 1. Value of the current offer:\n\u2022 The current offer on the table is [1, 2, 1, 1, 2] (which means you would receive, for each item type, 1 unit of item 1, 2 of item 2, etc.).\n\u2022 My private per\u2010unit values are: item 1 = 74, item 2 = 10, item 3 = 60, item 4 = 30, and item 5 = 17.\n\u2022 Thus, if I accept the current offer I\u2019d get:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: 1\u00d774 = 74  \n\u2003\u2003item 2: 2\u00d710 = 20  \n\u2003\u2003item 3: 1\u00d760 = 60  \n\u2003\u2003item 4: 1\u00d730 = 30  \n\u2003\u2003item 5: 2\u00d717 = 34  \n\u2003\u2003Total = 74 + 20 + 60 + 30 + 34 = 218.\n\u2022 Because we are in round 2 and outcomes are discounted by gamma^(r\u20131) with gamma = 0.9 (so a 0.9 multiplier now), the present value is 218\u00d70.9 = 196.2.\n\u2022 My current outside offer is 400, so this is far less favorable.\n\nStep 2. Designing a counteroffer:\n\u2022 I know that if I reject this offer and walk away I would get 400 (undiscounted). In order for a deal reached in round 2 to beat my outside option I need my \u201cundiscounted\u201d deal value to be high enough so that 0.9\u00d7(my deal value) is at least 400. That is, my deal value must be at least 400/0.9 \u2248 444.44.\n\u2022 Since the total maximum value (if I got everything) is 612, the maximum \u201cconcession\u201d I can make (i.e. the amount of my value I am willing to give up) is 612 \u2013 444.44 \u2248 167.56. (I must keep at least 444.44 in undiscounted value to beat my outside option after discounting.)\n\u2022 Now I choose which items I\u2019m more willing to concede. I value item 1 very highly (74 per unit) and item 3 almost as much (60 per unit), so I want to keep all of those. The lower\u2010value items for me are item 2 (10 per unit), item 4 (30 per unit), and item 5 (17 per unit). It thus makes sense to \u201cgive\u201d these to Player 2 in my counteroffer.\n\u2022 A natural, \u201cclean\u201d proposal is to offer all of item 2 (2 units) and all of item 5 (4 units) and a partial amount of item 4 so that I don\u2019t concede too much. Conceding all of item 2 and 5 gives me a \u201closs\u201d of:  \n\u2003\u20032\u00d710 (item 2) + 4\u00d717 (item 5) = 20 + 68 = 88.  \n\u2022 I can then consider conceding some of item 4. If I concede 2 out of 3 units (i.e. offer 2 units of item 4 to Player 2), that is an additional concession of 2\u00d730 = 60.\n\u2022 Total concession (loss on my side) = 88 + 60 = 148.\n\u2022 Then my retained items would be:\n\u2003\u2003item 1: keep all 1 unit  \n\u2003\u2003item 2: keep 0 (since 2 offered)  \n\u2003\u2003item 3: keep all 6 units  \n\u2003\u2003item 4: keep the remaining 1 out of 3  \n\u2003\u2003item 5: keep 0 (since 4 offered)  \n\u2003\u2003So my total value becomes:  \n\u2003\u20031\u00d774 + 6\u00d760 + 1\u00d730 = 74 + 360 + 30 = 464.\n\u2022 After discounting in round 2, my present value is 464\u00d70.9 = 417.6, which is above my outside offer of 400.\n\u2022 The counteroffer (\u201coffer\u201d means what I am giving to Player 2) in this proposal is then: [0, 2, 0, 2, 4]. (It complies with the available units on each type.)\n\nStep 3. Decision:\n\u2022 Accepting the current offer would give me only about 196.2 in present-value terms.\n\u2022 Walking away gives me 400.\n\u2022 By making this counteroffer I aim for a deal that would yield me 464 (undiscounted) and 417.6 (discounted) \u2013 which is an improvement over my outside offer. (Of course, I do not know Player 2\u2019s exact values, but this seems to be a rational improvement.)\n\u2022 So I will make a counteroffer.\n\nThus, my action is to send the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 2, 4]}",
                    "action": "COUNTEROFFER"
