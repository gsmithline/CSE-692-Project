Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 416. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 702 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 7, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    28 x 0 + 42 x 1 + 9 x 7 + 93 x 2 + 62 x 2\n    which is 415 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 416. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the negotiation concludes after one round, the value is not discounted. If it extends to additional rounds, the value is multiplied by gamma raised to the power of (r-1), where r is the number of rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n**Current Offer on the Table:** [1, 1, 5, 0, 0] (offered to me)\n\n- Value Calculation:\n  - 1 unit of Item 1: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n  - 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n  - 5 units of Item 3: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15\n  - 0 units of Item 4: 0 \u00d7 74 = 0\n  - 0 units of Item 5: 0 \u00d7 89 = 0\n- Total value of the current offer: 2 + 23 + 15 + 0 + 0 = 40\n\nSince the negotiation is in round 1, there is no discount yet, so the value remains 40.\n\n**Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n- The current offer value of 40 is much less than my outside offer value of 314.\n\n### 3) Making a Decision:\n\n- **Accepting the Offer:** \n  - Accepting would give me a value of 40, which is much lower than my outside offer of 314. Therefore, accepting the current offer is not advisable.\n\n- **Walking Away:**\n  - Walking away guarantees me my outside offer value of 314.\n\n- **Making a Counteroffer:**\n  - Any counteroffer I propose should aim to give me a value higher than my outside offer while being reasonable enough for Player 1 to consider.\n\nLet's suggest a counteroffer where I can secure valuable items:\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer to Player 1:** \n  - I offer Player 1: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0] (keeping for myself: 3 units of Item 3)\n\n- Counteroffer Calculation:\n  - 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 \n  - 3 units of Item 2: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n  - 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n  - 2 units of Item 4: 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n  - 2 units of Item 5: 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n- Total value of potential counteroffer for me: 6 + 69 + 9 + 148 + 178 = 410\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of 410, which is greater than my outside offer value of 314 and hopefully acceptable to Player 1 as it offers them a good number of total items.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]}\n```",

My previous offer was [1, 1, 5, 0, 0], giving me [2, 3, 2, 2, 2].\n\n3) Decision making:\n   The current offer gives me all units of items 1, 2, 4, and 5, which are my higher-value items. I only give up 4 units of item 3, which has my lowest value at 9 per unit.\n\n   Let me consider a counteroffer.

They're only asking for 4 units of my lowest-valued item (item 3), and letting me keep everything else. The value I would receive (530.1 after discount) far exceeds my outside offer of 416.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 2 + 41 x 1 + 7 x 0 + 26 x 3 + 68 x 3\n    which is 411 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 412. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 1 + 43 x 2 + 1 x 3 + 68 x 4 + 20 x 2\n    which is 451 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 452. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 1, 5, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Item 4 has my lowest value (33), followed by Item 3 (58).\n\nLet me try an initial offer:\n- Keep most of items 1 and 5 (my highest values)\n- Keep some of item 2 (medium value)\n- Offer more of items 3 and 4 (my lowest values)\n\nProposed division (what I keep):\n- Item 1: 3 units (3 \u00d7 93 = 279)\n- Item 2: 3 units (3 \u00d7 69 = 207)\n- Item 3: 0 units (0 \u00d7 58 = 0)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (1 \u00d7 33 = 33)\n- Item 5: 3 units (3 \u00d7 94 = 282)\n\nTotal value for me: 801\n\nThis is below my outside offer (1016), so it's not a good offer for me.\n\nLet me try again:\n- Item 1: 4 units (4 \u00d7 93 = 372)\n- Item 2: 3 units (3 \u00d7 69 = 207)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (1 \u00d7 58 = 58)\n- Item 4: 2 units (2 \u00d7 33 = 66)\n- Item 5: 4 units (4 \u00d7 94 = 376)\n\nTotal value for me: 1079, which exceeds my outside offer of 1016.\n\nSo my offer to Player 2 would be:\n- Item 1: 0 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 1 unit\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 0 units\n\n## 3) Decision:\nThis offer gives me a value of 1079, which is better than my outside offer of 1016.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 26 x 1 + 63 x 4 + 40 x 5 + 49 x 3\n    which is 625 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 626. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide my next action in the negotiation, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 697.\n\n2. **Values of the Items**: \n   - Item 1: 27 per unit\n   - Item 2: 36 per unit\n   - Item 3: 60 per unit\n   - Item 4: 59 per unit\n   - Item 5: 26 per unit\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items**: \n   - 1 unit of item 1\n   - 3 units of item 2\n   - 4 units of item 3\n   - 5 units of item 4\n   - 7 units of item 5\n\n4. **Discount Factor Influence**: \n   - The discount factor is 0.9. In the first round, it doesn't affect the value of a deal since \\(0.9^{0} = 1\\). This means the outcome value from an accepted offer in round 1 doesn't get discounted.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**: The current offer is [0, 1, 0, 2, 2] (the number of each item offered to me).\n\n   - Units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 27 = 0\n   - Units of item 2: 1 \u00d7 36 = 36\n   - Units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 60 = 0\n   - Units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n   - Units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n\n   - Total value of the current offer to me: \\(0 + 36 + 0 + 118 + 52 = 206\\)\n\n2. **Comparison with Outside Offer**: My outside offer is 697, which is significantly higher than the current offer's value of 206.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer?** No, because 206 < 697.\n- **Walk Away?** Not yet, as it's still the first round and a better offer could potentially be reached.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?** Yes, but make sure the counteroffer's value for me is greater than 697 to avoid a mistake.\n\n### Counteroffer Creation:\n\nTo avoid Mistake 2, I need to keep as much value as possible for myself, greater than my outside offer of 697. Here's a potential offer:\n\nLet's assume I propose:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keep all 1 unit)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (give away 2 units)\n- 0 units of item 3 (keep all 4 units)\n- 2 units of item 4 (give away 3 units)\n- 3 units of item 5 (give away 4 units)\n\nLet's calculate the value for me:\n\n- Units of item 1: 1 \u00d7 27 = 27\n- Units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n- Units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n- Units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n- Units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n\nTotal value to me: \\(27 + 72 + 240 + 177 + 104 = 620\\)\n\nThis is still less than 697. Therefore, I need to adjust my offer to keep more value.\n\nAdjustments:\n- Give away 1 unit of item 5 instead of 3:\n  - Units of item 5: 6 kept \u00d7 26 = 156\n  - New total value: \\(27 + 72 + 240 + 177 + 156 = 672\\) \n\nThis is still less than 697. \n\nLet's Try this:\n\nKeep all items of the most valuable ones:\n\n- 0 units of item 1 (value = 27)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (value from 2 units given = 72)\n- 0 units of item 3 (value = 240)\n- 2 units of item 4 (value from 3 units given = 177)\n- 6 units of item 5 (value 1 unit given = 26)\n\nRecalculated total value:\n- \\(27 + 72 + 240 + 177 + 156 = 672\\) which is still under 697.\n\nIt seems I won't beat the outside offer. Hence it\u2019s better to WALK and fallback on my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 78 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 43 x 0\n    which is 50 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 56. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, we do not know Player 1's values, so we'll make a strategic offer that greatly increases our value. \n\n#### Proposed Counteroffer to Player 1:\nLet's propose keeping more of item 3, as it has a high value for us. \n\nI will keep:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 1 units of item 2\n- 4 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 1 unit of item 5\n\nOffering Player 1:\n- 0 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 unit of item 5\n\nProvide a counteroffer such that my value:\n- Item 1: 3 unit \u00d7 4 = 12\n- Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 23 = 23\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 34 = 136\n- Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 55 = 110\n- Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 77 = 77\n\nTotal value = 12 + 23 + 136 + 110 + 77 = 358\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of 358 to remain competitive with my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\",\n  \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 56. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 78 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 43 x 0\n    which is 50 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 56. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze this situation step-by-step to determine my best move.\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n\n- My outside offer value: 56\n- My item values: \n  - Item 1: 64 per unit (3 units total)\n  - Item 2: 25 per unit (4 units total)\n  - Item 3: 78 per unit (6 units total)\n  - Item 4: 46 per unit (3 units total)\n  - Item 5: 43 per unit (1 unit total)\n- Total pool: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n- Discount factor: Since we're in round 2, any deal would be multiplied by \u03b3\u00b9 = 0.9\n\n### 2) Assessing the Current Offer:\n\nPlayer 2's offer to me is [0, 3, 2, 1, 0], meaning I would get:\n- 0 units of item 1 (0 \u00d7 64 = 0)\n- 3 units of item 2 (3 \u00d7 25 = 75)\n- 2 units of item 3 (2 \u00d7 78 = 156)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (1 \u00d7 46 = 46)\n- 0 units of item 5 (0 \u00d7 43 = 0)\n\nTotal value = 277\n\nWith discount factor: 277 \u00d7 0.9 = 249.3\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 56.\n\n### 3) Analyzing Player 2's Behavior:\n\nBased on their offer, Player 2 seems to value:\n- Item 1 highly (they want all 3 units)\n- Item 3 moderately (they want 4 out of 6 units)\n- Item 5 highly (they want the only unit)\n- Item 2 less (they're offering me 3 of 4 units)\n- Item 4 moderately (they want 2 of 3 units)\n\n### 4) Forming a Counteroffer:\n\nI could propose a slight improvement for myself while still making it attractive to Player 2. Let's try:\n[1, 3, 2, 1, 0] - offering them 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with:\n- 2 units of item 1 (2 \u00d7 64 = 128)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (1 \u00d7 25 = 25)\n- 4 units of item 3 (4 \u00d7 78 = 312)\n- 2 units of item 4 (2 \u00d7 46 = 92)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (1 \u00d7 43 = 43)\n\nTotal value for me = 600\nWith discount factor: 600 \u00d7 0.9 = 540\n\nThis is much better than both my outside offer (56) and the current offer (249.3).\n\n### 5) Decision:\n\nThe current offer is already quite good (249.3 > 56), but I believe I can get a better deal. My counteroffer provides me with 540 value while still giving Player 2 items they seem to value.\n\nHowever, I should be careful not to appear too greedy and risk Player 2 walking away. Since we're already in round 2, the next round will have an additional discount.\n\nGiven the analysis, I'll make a counteroffer that slightly improves my position:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 2, 1, 0]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 78 x 0 + 46 x 0 + 43 x 0\n    which is 50 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 56. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I'll analyze this step-by-step to make the best decision for round 3.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\nMy outside offer value: 56\n\nMy item values:\n- Item 1: 64 per unit (3 units total)\n- Item 2: 25 per unit (4 units total)\n- Item 3: 78 per unit (6 units total)\n- Item 4: 46 per unit (3 units total)\n- Item 5: 43 per unit (1 unit total)\n\nTotal pool: 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n\nThis is round 3, with discount factor \u03b3 = 0.9. Since we're in round 3, the discount is \u03b3\u00b2 = 0.81.\n\n## 2) Value Assessment\n\nCurrent offer from Player 2 gives me: [1, 1, 3, 1, 0]\nLet me calculate its value:\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n- 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\nTotal value = 369\n\nWith discount factor of 0.81 (since we're in round 3), this becomes: 369 \u00d7 0.81 = 298.89\n\nMy outside offer value is 56, so accepting this offer is much better than walking away.\n\n## 3) Decision Making\n\nLooking at the negotiation history:\n- Player 2 seems to value item 2 less (offering 3 units in round 1)\n- Player 2 seems to value item 3 less (willing to give me 3 units in the current offer)\n- Player 2 consistently keeps item 5 (might value it highly)\n\nThe current offer on the table is quite good for me. It gives me a discounted value of 298.89, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 56.\n\nSince this is the final round, my options are limited:\n1. Accept the current offer: Value = 298.89\n2. Walk away: Value = 56\n3. Make a counteroffer: If Player 2 rejects, we both get our outside offers\n\nGiven that this is the final round, and the current offer is substantially better than my outside offer, the rational choice is to accept.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 0 + 99 x 0 + 100 x 4 + 51 x 4 + 29 x 0\n    which is 604 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 605. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 2, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 1, 5]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer and determine if I should accept, counteroffer, or walk away.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 605\n- My item values: 98 for item 1, 99 for item 2, 100 for item 3, 51 for item 4, 29 for item 5\n- Total items: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: gamma = 0.9 (at round 2, so any deal is worth 0.9 of its original value)\n- It's currently round 2, so any deal is multiplied by 0.9\n\n## Step 2: Assess the value of the current offer\n\nPlayer 2 offered me [0, 0, 2, 1, 5], meaning I keep [3, 2, 4, 3, 2].\n\nThe value of keeping these items would be:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n\nTotal value before discount = 1103\nTotal value after discount (round 2) = 1103 \u00d7 0.9 = 992.7\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 605.\n\n## Step 3: Consider my previous offer and opponent's behavior\n\nMy previous offer [0, 0, 1, 2, 5] gave me [3, 2, 5, 2, 2] which is worth:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n- 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 100 = 500\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n\nTotal value = 1152\n\nPlayer 2's counteroffer suggests:\n- They asked for 1 more unit of item 3 (which I value at 100)\n- They gave me 1 more unit of item 4 (which I value at 51)\n- This is a net loss for me of 49 value points\n\nThis suggests Player 2 values item 3 more than item 4, which aligns with my valuation as well.\n\n## Step 4: Make a decision\n\nOptions:\n1. Accept the current offer: Worth 992.7 after discount (> 605 outside offer)\n2. Make a counteroffer: Risk another round of discounting\n3. Walk away: Get 605 from outside offer\n\nThe current offer is significantly better than my outside offer, so I shouldn't walk away.\n\nIf I make a counteroffer, I should try to keep more of item 3 (high value to me at 100), and give away more of item 5 (low value to me at 29).\n\nLet me try a slight improvement over their offer. I'll propose giving them [0, 0, 2, 2, 6] which means I keep [3, 2, 4, 2, 1].\n\nValue to me:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n\nTotal value = 1023\n\nHowever, if this goes to round 3, it would be worth 1023 \u00d7 0.81 = 828.63, which is still better than my outside offer.\n\nSince the current offer is already good (992.7 > 605), and we're already in round 2 (with discount applied), I should accept this offer rather than risk further discounting.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This factor reduces the value of future negotiations if they continue in later rounds. It is applied as gamma^(r-1), where r is the round number.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**:\n  - My share of items if I accept the current offer:\n    - Item 1: 0 units \u2192 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n    - Item 2: 5 units \u2192 5 \u00d7 83 = 415\n    - Item 3: 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n    - Item 4: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n    - Item 5: 1 unit \u2192 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n  - Total Value = 415 + 60 + 194 + 63 = 732\n\n- **Comparison to My Outside Offer Value**:\n  - The total value of the current offer (732) is greater than my outside offer (597). However, since it's the first round, there's no discount applied to this outcome yet, so the current round\u2019s offer value remains 732.\n\n### 3) Decision Based on Analysis\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer**: Accepting this offer gives a total value higher than my outside offer (732 > 597), and because there is no discount yet, it is beneficial to accept the current offer over taking my outside offer.\n  \n- **Mistakes to Avoid**:\n  - Mistake 4 (Accepting an offer worse than outside offer) is avoided since 732 > 597.\n  - Mistake 5 (Walking away from a better offer) would occur if I walked away here since 732 > 597.\n\nGiven that the offer is better than my fallback option, and there are no discounts applied in this first round, it makes sense to accept this offer to maximize my current utility.\n\nHence, the rational course of action is:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 5, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 1 + 6 x 1 + 91 x 5 + 27 x 2 + 40 x 0\n    which is 606 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 607. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 586. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 0, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 2 + 63 x 3 + 14 x 0 + 50 x 2 + 70 x 3\n    which is 585 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 586. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Generally, when proposing, since my perceived value of what I should keep in negotiation is less than my outside offer even when divided favorably for me, I should consider walking.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on Analysis:\n\n- Accepting the current offer results in a very low value compared to my outside offer.\n- Walking away guarantees me 656.\n- Proposing a counteroffer may not reach a greater value than my outside option.\n\nGiven these analyses and since the best possible division still yields less than the outside offer even after the discount adjustment, the optimal decision is:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 4 + 62 x 0 + 25 x 0 + 51 x 1 + 87 x 1\n    which is 142 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 148. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 18. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your value would be:\n    14 x 3 + 82 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 1 x 6 + 52 x 0\n    which is 48 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 49. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The value of the negotiation outcome in future rounds is multiplied by \u03b3^(r-1).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of the Current Offer\n- **Current Offer on the Table**: [1, 0, 5, 9, 1] (What I would receive)\n  - Value from 1 unit of Item 1: 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n  - Value from 0 units of Item 2: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n  - Value from 5 units of Item 3: 5 \u00d7 39 = 195\n  - Value from 9 units of Item 4: 9 \u00d7 36 = 324 \n  - Value from 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n  - **Total Value of Current Offer**: 35 + 0 + 195 + 324 + 65 = 619\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**: The current offer gives me a value of 619, which is less than my outside offer value of 660. Therefore, accepting it would be a mistake under Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse than my outside offer).\n\n### Step 3: Decision-Making\nGiven that the current offer's value (619) is less than my outside offer (660), it is not in my interest to accept this offer. I should aim either to obtain a better deal or walk away, based on the potential offers I might consider proposing.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffer Consideration:\n1. I need to ensure any counteroffer results in a value greater than 660 for myself, avoiding Mistake 2 (offering less than my outside offer).\n2. I can consider providing fewer units of high-value items to Player 1 and retaining better value items for myself.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that aims to surpass my outside offer value and encourage Player 1 to accept by not being overly demanding, thus facilitating a potential deal without them walking away.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer\n- **Counteroffer Distribution for Player 1**: [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]\n  - Meaning I suggest Player 1 receives:\n    - 1 unit of Item 1\n    - 2 units of Item 2\n    - 1 unit of Item 3\n    - 2 units of Item 4\n    - 3 units of Item 5\n\n- **My Retained Units and Value**:\n  - Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units \u2192 70 value\n  - Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3 units \u2192 12 value\n  - Item 3: 5 - 1 = 4 units \u2192 156 value\n  - Item 4: 9 - 2 = 7 units \u2192 252 value\n  - Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units \u2192 130 value\n  - **Total Value to Me**: 70 + 12 + 156 + 252 + 130 = 620 \n\nGiven the need to elevate the proposal beyond prior contrasts, a more generous counterweight strategy targets increasing the retention of high-value Items 4 and 5. An adjusted proposal might involve revising Item 5 distribution to [1, 0, 1, 4, 2], theoretically augmenting the combined value magnitude allocated and counterbalanced reward diversification.\n  \n### Action\nTherefore, here is my action based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 3, 5, 3]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 9 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 14 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 1 for item 3, 1 for item 4, 52 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 726. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 49. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 49. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 450 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 3 + 82 x 0 + 1 x 0 + 1 x 6 + 52 x 0\n    which is 48 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 49. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 5, 9, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 3, 5, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 3, 5, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

They're also willing to give me more of items 2 and 5, which I value highly.\n\nSince their offer is worth 320.4 to me (with discount), which is much better than my outside offer of 49, accepting would be reasonable. However, I could try one more counteroffer to get even more value.\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer where I keep more of the high-value items (2 and 5) while giving away more of the low-value items (3 and 4):\n\nProposed counteroffer (what I give to Player 2):\n- 1 unit of item 1 (keeping 2)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 4)\n- 5 units of item 3 (keeping 0)\n- 8 units of item 4 (keeping 1)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 4)\n\nValue to me of this offer:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 82 = 328\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 52 = 208\n\nTotal = 565 (with discount: 508.5)\n\nThis offer is worth significantly more to me than their current offer, but still gives them many items. Since this is round 2 of 3, there's some risk that Player 2 might counter or walk away, leading to the final round with further discounting.\n\nGiven that Player 2's offer is already quite good for me (320.4 versus outside offer of 49), and we're in the second round with one more negotiation round possible, I think it's worth making one final counteroffer to try to maximize my value.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 5, 8, 1]}",

To maximize my gain without making a mistake, I should propose a counteroffer that improves my value compared to both the current offer and my outside offer.\n\n   I will make a counteroffer that improves my situation by reducing the number of items offered to Player 1, thereby increasing my share while ensuring the values of the items I keep surpass my outside offer post-discount. Considering mistakes 1, 2, and 3, I need to craft a better distribution for myself, as future rounds and walking provide limits.\n\n4) **Counteroffer Calculation:**\n   - Counteroffer to Player 1: [2, 0, 1, 1, 2] (I keep 1 unit of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 for myself)\n     - Value for me:\n       - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n       - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n       - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n       - Item 4: 8 \u00d7 36 = 288\n       - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n       - Total = 35 + 20 + 156 + 288 + 195 = 694\n     - Adjusted for discount (round 2, \u03b3^(1) = 0.9): 694 \u00d7 0.9 = 624.6, which is still less than the outside offer of 660. \n     \nHowever, given a better offer isn't feasible due to item limits and needing to avoid proposing something impractical, the decision to walk remains optimal unless solid counter-near-offer evaluation reveals an alternate increase. Since potential round limitations further add risk to selections, more focus on close-future results (here the outside offer outweighing adjusted immediate deals) is essential.\n\nThus, **walking** secures the current best-case value derived under constraints.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 631. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    33 x 2 + 74 x 5 + 89 x 2 + 10 x 1 + 6 x 1\n    which is 630 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 631. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Retains my highest-value items\n\nLet me consider giving Player 2:\n- 2 units of item 1 (keeping 4)\n- 2 units of item 2 (keeping 3)\n- 2 units of item 3 (keeping 2)\n- 0 units of item 4 (none available)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 4)\n\nMy value with this offer:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 88 = 352\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 72 = 288\nTotal value to me: 888\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer of 599, and gives a reasonable amount to Player 2 as a starting point.\n\nSince this is the first round, I want to start with a strong position while still leaving room for negotiation. This offer gives me 888 points while offering Player 2 some of each available item type.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 13. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 624 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, there is no immediate discount impact.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]:** Calculate the value to me:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \\times 21 = 42\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \\times 33 = 66\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \\times 11 = 22\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \\times 52 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \\times 91 = 91\n     - Total value = 42 + 66 + 22 + 0 + 91 = 221\n\n   - Compare this to my outside offer of 13. Clearly, accepting the current offer is much more valuable than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n\n   Given that the current offer gives me a value of 221, which is much higher than my outside offer of 13, it is beneficial to accept this offer.\n\nMistake 5 warns against walking away from an offer better than my outside offer, which directly applies here.

For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 5, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 5 + 59 x 1 + 57 x 5 + 36 x 1 + 61 x 0\n    which is 660 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 662. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To decide on the best course of action, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 410.\n   - **Values of the Items:**\n     - Item 1: 55 per unit\n     - Item 2: 3 per unit\n     - Item 3: 12 per unit\n     - Item 4: 12 per unit\n     - Item 5: 69 per unit\n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 5 units of Item 1, 3 units of Item 2, 5 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:**\n     - Since we are in round 1, the discount factor does not affect the current round but will influence subsequent rounds. If it proceeds to further rounds, the value I get will be multiplied by \\(0.9^{(r-1)}\\), where \\(r\\) is the round number.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer Value to Me:**\n     - I am being offered 0 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, and 0 units of Item 5, i.e., [0, 1, 1, 1, 0].\n     - Value calculation:\n       - Item 2: \\(1 \\times 3 = 3\\)\n       - Item 3: \\(1 \\times 12 = 12\\)\n       - Item 4: \\(1 \\times 12 = 12\\)\n     - Total value = 3 + 12 + 12 = 27\n   - **Comparison with Outside Offer:**\n     - My outside offer is 410, much higher than this offer value of 27.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - **Accept the Current Offer?**\n     - No, the current offer's value (27) is significantly lower than my outside offer (410).\n   - **Walk Away?**\n     - Not yet, because I can propose a counteroffer that potentially gets me closer to the value worth my while.\n   - **Propose a Counteroffer?**\n     - I will propose a counteroffer where the value is above my outside offer or at least a strong position to negotiate from in future rounds. I should aim to increase the total value of the items to me.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffer:**\n     - Since this is the first round and my outside offer is significantly high, I should aim for a high-value counteroffer.\n     - Consider proposing 3 units of Item 1, 1 item of Item 4, and 1 item of Item 5 to myself, which would offer the remaining to Player 1.\n     - This translates to a counteroffer of: [2, 0, 5, 0, 0] to Player 1, which results in:\n       - To me:\n         - Item 1: \\( 3 \\times 55 = 165 \\)\n         - Item 4: \\( 1 \\times 12 = 12 \\)\n         - Item 5: \\( 1 \\times 69 = 69 \\)\n       - Value = 165 + 12 + 69 = 246, which is less than my outside offer, but offers strong grounds for future negotiation.\n\nTherefore, I propose a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 5, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 662. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 5, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 5 + 59 x 1 + 57 x 5 + 36 x 1 + 61 x 0\n    which is 660 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 662. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Appears reasonable to the other player\n\nMy most valuable items are:\n- Item 2 (81 per unit)\n- Item 4 (63 per unit)\n- Item 5 (45 per unit)\n- Item 1 (39 per unit)\n- Item 3 (10 per unit)\n\nLet me calculate what I should keep:\n- I should keep all of item 2: 2 units \u00d7 81 = 162\n- I should keep all of item 4: 6 units \u00d7 63 = 378\n- I should keep the 1 unit of item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 45 = 45\n- I could offer some of item 1 and most of item 3 since I value them less\n\nIf I keep all of items 2, 4, and 5, plus 3 units of item 1 and 0 units of item 3, my value would be:\n162 + 378 + 45 + (3 \u00d7 39) + (0 \u00d7 10) = 702\n\nThis is above my outside offer of 689, so it's acceptable.\n\nMy initial offer to Player 2 would then be:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (giving away 1/4 of item 1)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping all units)\n- 7 units of item 3 (giving away all units)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping all units)\n- 0 units of item 5 (keeping all units)\n\nThis means I'm offering [1, 0, 7, 0, 0] to Player 2.\n\nThis is a reasonable starting offer because:\n1. It's above my minimum acceptable value (702 > 689)\n2. I'm offering all of the item I value least (item 3)\n3. I'm offering some of item 1 as a gesture of good faith\n4. I'm keeping the items I value most (2, 4, and 5)\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 7, 0, 0]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 444. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 543 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 7, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 7, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are currently in round 1, the discount factor has not yet impacted the value.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer (if accepted)**:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 43 = 43\n  - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 56 = 0\n  - Item 3: 7 units \u00d7 18 = 126\n  - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 18 = 0\n  - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 46 = 0\n  - **Total value**: 43 + 0 + 126 + 0 + 0 = 169\n\n- **Comparison with outside offer**:\n  - The current offer has a total value of 169 to me, which is less than my outside offer value of 444.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers**:\n  - I need to create a counteroffer that gives me a total value greater than 444.\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\n\n- **Current offer**: Value is 169, which is less than my outside offer (444).\n\n- **Decision**:\n  - Accepting the current offer would be a mistake, as it has a lower value than my outside offer (Mistake 4).\n  - Walking away right now would default me to my outside offer, which is 444.\n  - Proposing a counteroffer is sensible, as it might lead to a mutually acceptable division better than my outside offer value. \n\nA potential offer could attempt to retain items of high value to me, such as offering Player 1 fewer items or items that contribute less to my value calculation.\n\n### Potential Counteroffer Calculations:\n\nGiven Player 1's offer, they appear to highly value item 3, as they allocated all 7 units to me. Therefore, counteroffering the majority or all of item 3 may be strategic.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer maximizing my retention of higher-value items while considering the division of item 3:\n\n- Offer the following split to Player 1: \n  - Item 1: 1 (retain 3 for myself)\n  - Item 2: 1 (retain 1 for myself)\n  - Item 3: 5 (retain 2 for myself)\n  - Item 4: 2 (retain 4 for myself)\n  - Item 5: 0 (retain 1 for myself)\n\n**Value to me with this counteroffer**:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n- Item 3: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n- Item 4: 4 \u00d7 18 = 72\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n- **Total value**: 129 + 56 + 36 + 72 + 46 = 339\n\nEven though this offer still doesn't exceed my outside offer, it is a start that retains significant items for negotiation leverage.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 5, 2, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 7, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 2 + 81 x 2 + 10 x 7 + 63 x 6 + 45 x 0\n    which is 688 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 689. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 444. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 543 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 7, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 5, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's break down and analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n- **What is my outside offer value?**\n  - My outside offer value is 444.\n\n- **What are the values of the items involved?**\n  - Item 1: Value per unit = 43\n  - Item 2: Value per unit = 56\n  - Item 3: Value per unit = 18\n  - Item 4: Value per unit = 18\n  - Item 5: Value per unit = 46\n\n- **What is the total pool of items?**\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 2 units\n  - Item 3: 7 units\n  - Item 4: 6 units\n  - Item 5: 1 unit\n\n- **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**\n  - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, and since we are in round 2, the value of any deal concluded in this round is multiplied by \\(0.9^{(2-1)} = 0.9\\). This reduces the value of agreements reached in later rounds, so it's important to consider immediate offers versus waiting.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current offer: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]**\n  - Value from items:\n    - \\(2 \\times 18 = 36\\) for item 3\n  - Total value = 36\n  - Adjusted value (round 2 discount) = 36 \u00d7 0.9 = 32.4\n\n- **Compare to my outside offer value of 444:**\n  - The current offer's adjusted value of 32.4 is far below the outside offer value of 444.\n\n- **For potential counteroffers:**\n  - I need to create a counteroffer where my retained value is greater than or equal to my outside offer (444).\n\n### Example Calculation for a Counteroffer:\nLet's see what retaining the following would look like for me, and ensuring that I assess the retained value is greater than 444.\n- Example Retained items: [3, 1, 5, 4, 1]\n  - Retained value:\n    - \\(3 \\times 43 = 129\\) for item 1\n    - \\(1 \\times 56 = 56\\) for item 2\n    - \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\) for item 3\n    - \\(4 \\times 18 = 72\\) for item 4\n    - \\(1 \\times 46 = 46\\) for item 5\n  - Total retained value = 393\n- This also means Player 1 receives: [1, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\nHowever, since 393 is less than the outside offer of 444, I need to retain more.\n\nLet's try another allocation:\n- My retained items: [3, 1, 5, 4, 1]\n  - Retained value:\n    - \\(3 \\times 43 = 129\\) for item 1\n    - \\(1 \\times 56 = 56\\) for item 2\n    - \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\) for item 3\n    - \\(4 \\times 18 = 72\\) for item 4\n    - \\(1 \\times 46 = 46\\) for item 5\n  - Total retained value = 393\n\n- Adjusted value = 393 * 0.9 = 353.7\n- The adjusted value of 353.7 is below my outside offer. Thus, I need to retain more or propose another distribution to Player 1.\n\nAfter reassessing another distribution like [3, 1, 5, 3, 1], the retained value is still short of 444 even after distribution attempts.\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\nGiven that neither the current offer nor any suitable counteroffer achieves more than my outside offer, my best decision is to walk away:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 2 + 89 x 0 + 9 x 1 + 69 x 0 + 73 x 0\n    which is 53 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 58. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means the value of an outcome decreases by 10% per round, so accepting sooner can be more valuable due to the discount.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer ([4, 0, 4, 0, 0]) being offered to me:\n     - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 31 = 124\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n     - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 90 = 360\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n     - Total value if I accept this offer = 124 + 360 = 484\n   - Compare to my outside offer value of 4:\n     - 484 is significantly greater than 4.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me a value of 484, which is much higher than my outside offer of 4.\n   - Since the offer on the table is better than my fallback position and also with the discount factor in play, accepting the offer in the first round maximizes my value.\n   - Therefore, I should accept the current offer, as it provides a substantial gain.\n\nGiven this analysis, my action should be:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 941. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 941. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 561 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 5, 4, 4, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 5 + 32 x 5 + 54 x 4 + 53 x 4 + 36 x 8\n    which is 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 941. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

This doesn't immediately impact my decision in round 1 but will in subsequent rounds if we continue negotiating.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - Current offer if I accept it: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] \n     - My value: \\( 0 \\times 32 + 0 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 51 + 0 \\times 29 + 1 \\times 79 = 79 \\)\n   - Comparing the current offer value (79) to my outside offer (586), the current offer is significantly worse.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I need to ensure that the value I receive is greater than 586 to make a counteroffer worthwhile.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   - Accept the current offer? No, because its value (79) is much lower than my outside offer (586). Accepting would make mistake 4 (accepting a worse offer than the outside offer).\n   - Walk away and take the outside offer?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 941. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 561 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 5, 4, 4, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 5 + 32 x 5 + 54 x 4 + 53 x 4 + 36 x 8\n    which is 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 941. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation carefully to make the best decision. Let's follow the step-by-step approach:\n\n## 1) Analyzing the current situation:\n\n- My outside offer value: 941\n- My item values: \n  - Item 1: 12 per unit (5 units total)\n  - Item 2: 32 per unit (5 units total)\n  - Item 3: 54 per unit (4 units total)\n  - Item 4: 53 per unit (5 units total)\n  - Item 5: 36 per unit (8 units total)\n- Total pool: 5 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.9 (currently in round 2, so any deal now will be discounted by \u03b3\u00b9 = 0.9)\n\n## 2) Assessing offers:\n\nCurrent offer from Player 2: [0, 0, 1, 2, 2]\nThis means I would get:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 12 = 60\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 32 = 160\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 54 = 162\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 53 = 159\n- 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 36 = 216\n\nTotal value to me: 60 + 160 + 162 + 159 + 216 = 757\nWith round 2 discount: 757 \u00d7 0.9 = 681.3\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 941.\n\n## 3) Potential counteroffer:\n\nLet me design a counteroffer that would give me more value while still being potentially attractive to Player 2.\n\nBased on their previous offer, Player 2 seems to value item 3, 4, and 5 reasonably highly since they're asking for some of these. They didn't request any of items 1 and 2, so they may value those less.\n\nI should keep most of the high-value items to me (items 3 and 4) and offer some of the lower-value items (like item 1):\n\nIf I offer: [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]\nI would keep:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 32 = 128\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 53 = 212\n- 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 36 = 216\n\nMy total: 36 + 128 + 216 + 212 + 216 = 808\nWith round 2 discount: 808 \u00d7 0.9 = 727.2\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer. Let me adjust further:\n\nIf I offer: [2, 1, 0, 0, 2]\nI would keep:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 32 = 128\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 53 = 265\n- 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 36 = 216\n\nMy total: 36 + 128 + 216 + 265 + 216 = 861\nWith round 2 discount: 861 \u00d7 0.9 = 774.9\n\nStill not enough. Let me try one more adjustment:\n\nIf I offer: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nI would keep:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 12 = 48\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 32 = 128\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 53 = 265\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 36 = 252\n\nMy total: 48 + 128 + 216 + 265 + 252 = 909\nWith round 2 discount: 909 \u00d7 0.9 = 818.1\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 941. Given that we're already in round 2 (with the discount factor applied), it's unlikely I'll be able to make a counteroffer that would exceed my outside offer after accounting for the discount.\n\n## Decision:\n\nThe best action is to WALK away. Even my best potential counteroffers fall short of my outside offer value after applying the discount factor, and the current offer from Player 2 is even worse.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's go through the provided step-by-step process:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value:** 769\n- **Values of the items involved (my valuation):**\n  - Item 1: 14\n  - Item 2: 91\n  - Item 3: 71\n  - Item 4: 97\n  - Item 5: 62\n\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 7 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor influence:** The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) decreases the value of future rounds. If an agreement is reached this round, the value is not discounted. If reached in round 2, it is multiplied by 0.9. \n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer (to me):** [2, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n  - Value calculation:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 91 = 91\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n    - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 62 = 0\n  - Total value = 28 + 91 + 142 + 194 = 455\n\nSince 455 is significantly less than my outside offer of 769, accepting this would not be beneficial.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n1. **Should I accept the current offer?**\n   - No, because its value (455) is less than my outside offer (769).\n\n2. **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n   - This could be an option if I cannot formulate a counteroffer that is more advantageous.\n\n3. **Should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n   - Yes, a counteroffer could be proposed to aim for more value.\n\n   **Potential Counteroffer:**\n   - My goal is to achieve a total value greater than 769.\n   - Let's try proposing a division that targets higher-value items for me while ensuring it might be reasonable for the other player.\n\n   Possible reasonable counteroffer: [0, 4, 0, 0, 1] (I\u2019ll keep 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, and 2 units of item 4 while offering 4 units of item 2 and 1 unit of item 5 to Player 1)\n\n   **Calculation of my kept value:**\n   - 5 units of item 1 = 5 x 14 = 70\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 x 91 = 273\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 71 = 142\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 x 97 = 194\n   - 0 units of item 5 = 0 x 62 = 0\n\n   Total value = 70 + 273 + 142 + 194 = 679\n  \nThis counteroffer is still less than the outside offer, and therefore, I should not submit a counteroffer. It looks like WALKING away holds more value than sticking with this negotiation based on what's currently being offered and my projections for possible proposals.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate response is:\n  \n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
