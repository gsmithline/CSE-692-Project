This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 1 has re-offered the same offer as in round 1: [0, 3, 2, 1, 1]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* Item 1: 0 * 61 = 0\n* Item 2: 3 * 55 = 165\n* Item 3: 2 * 100 = 200\n* Item 4: 1 * 86 = 86\n* Item 5: 1 * 19 = 19\nTotal value of the offer: 0 + 165 + 200 + 86 + 19 = 470\n\nNow, let's consider the discount factor. We are in round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nThe present value of the offer is 470 * 0.9 = 423.\n\nMy outside offer is 521. Since the present value of Player 1's current offer (423) is less than my outside offer (521), I should not accept it.\n\nNow I need to decide whether to walk away or make a counteroffer. If I walk away, I get 521. If I make a counteroffer and it is rejected, I get 521 in the next round, but it is discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81, which is 521*0.81 = 422.01. This makes me want to try making a counteroffer one last time.\n\nSince Player 1 seems to value item 1 a lot less than I do, let me propose an offer where I keep more of the item 1. Let's also shift some items so that they get more item 5.\nLet me propose giving Player 1 [1, 4, 3, 1, 0]\nThis leaves me with [2, 3, 4, 1, 2].\nMy value is then:\nItem 1: 2 * 61 = 122\nItem 2: 3 * 55 = 165\nItem 3: 4 * 100 = 400\nItem 4: 1 * 86 = 86\nItem 5: 2 * 19 = 38\nTotal Value = 122 + 165 + 400 + 86 + 38 = 811\nDiscounted = 811 * 0.9 = 729.9 > 521, so this is a good offer to make.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

Mistake 4 would occur if I accept this offer.\n- **WALK**: Since the current offer is less than my outside offer, walking away will give me a guaranteed higher payoff.\n- **COUNTEROFFER**: I need to make a counteroffer that yields at least a value of 990 or more to consider any potential better deal. In Round 3, no more counteroffers are possible, so this decision isn't viable.\n\nGiven that this is the final round for my action, and since walking away provides a higher guaranteed payoff than the current offer, the most rational choice is to walk away and accept my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

My private values are 64, 41, 66, 15, and 57 for items 1 through 5. My outside offer is 1157. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 * 64 = 192\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 41 = 41\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 * 66 = 132\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 * 15 = 0\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 * 57 = 171\nTotal value of the current offer: 192 + 41 + 132 + 0 + 171 = 536\n\nNow, we need to consider the discount factor since it is round 2. The value is discounted by gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nPresent value of the current offer: 536 * 0.9 = 482.4\n\nSince 482.4 is much lower than my outside offer of 1157, accepting the offer is not a good idea.\n\nNow, I need to consider making a counteroffer. The goal is to find a counteroffer that Player 1 might accept, which also gives me a value greater than my outside offer when discounted. I have the following items available:\n- Item 1: 8 units\n- Item 2: 5 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 6 units\n\nPlayer 1's current offer leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 8 - 3 = 5 units\n- Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n- Item 3: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n- Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n- Item 5: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n\nThe value to me is 5 * 64 + 4 * 41 + 1 * 66 + 4 * 15 + 3 * 57 = 320 + 164 + 66 + 60 + 171 = 781. This results in a discounted value of 781*0.9 = 702.9, which is far lower than my outside option.\n\nI will make a counteroffer. I will give Player 1: [2, 1, 0, 0, 2]. This leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 6 units\n- Item 2: 4 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 4 units\n\nMy value would be: 6 * 64 + 4 * 41 + 3 * 66 + 4 * 15 + 4 * 57 = 384 + 164 + 198 + 60 + 228 = 1034\nDiscounted value: 1034 * 0.9 = 930.6.\nThis is still less than my outside option.\n\nLet's make a better offer to myself, i.e. a worse offer to Player 1. I will give Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] and I would have:\n- Item 1: 7 units\n- Item 2: 5 units\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 5 units\nMy value would be: 7 * 64 + 5 * 41 + 3 * 66 + 4 * 15 + 5 * 57 = 448 + 205 + 198 + 60 + 285 = 1196.\nDiscounted value: 1196 * 0.9 = 1076.4\n\nOkay, that is still a poor outcome and it's round 2! Let's try one last thing: giving the other player everything they want. This is: [3, 1, 2, 0, 3]\nMy value = 5 * 64 + 4 * 41 + 1 * 66 + 4 * 15 + 3 * 57 = 320 + 164 + 66 + 60 + 171 = 781. Discounted value = 702.9. Still awful\n\nLet's offer the other player [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] like I did in the previous round! Then I get to keep the rest:\nValue: 7 * 64 + 5 * 41 + 3 * 66 + 4 * 15 + 6 * 57 = 448 + 205 + 198 + 60 + 342 = 1253\nDiscounted value: 1253 * 0.9 = 1127.7, which is STILL LESS than my outside offer!\n\nIt seems very difficult to get a deal that beats my outside offer in this round. Given that it's round 2, and I'm not able to find a counteroffer better than my outside offer, and it is better to take my guaranteed value rather than continuing negotiations, I will walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 493. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 780 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's walk through the provided steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is worth 493.\n- **Values of Items and Total Pool**:\n  - Item 1: 4 units available, valued at 12 per unit.\n  - Item 2: 2 units available, valued at 42 per unit.\n  - Item 3: 2 units available, valued at 31 per unit.\n  - Item 4: 5 units available, valued at 87 per unit.\n  - Item 5: 2 units available, valued at 88 per unit.\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - Total value for me if I take all items = \\( (4 \\times 12) + (2 \\times 42) + (2 \\times 31) + (5 \\times 87) + (2 \\times 88) = 805 \\).\n\n- **Discount Factor**: In the first round, the discount factor does not apply yet as no rounds have been accepted or passed. The value remains as is if we make a decision now.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table, so nothing to evaluate.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: My target is to secure a total value greater than my outside offer of 493. To maximize my value, we can consider different allocations for the items:\n\n  Let's consider a potential counteroffer that gives me maximum value while still being a reasonable offer to Player 2. Suppose I keep high-value items in terms of my private valuations:\n\n  - Keep all 5 units of item 4 (value = \\(5 \\times 87 = 435\\))\n  - Keep all 2 units of item 5 (value = \\(2 \\times 88 = 176\\))\n  - Give away all of item 1, 2, and 3 to Player 2 (for negotiation purposes; total give away value in terms of item count is reasonable):\n\n  Calculating total value to me in this allocation:\n  - Value from keeping: \n    - Item 4: 435\n    - Item 5: 176\n  - Total: 435 + 176 = 611\n\n611 is substantially greater than my outside offer value of 493.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Offer Reasoning**: By this calculation, keeping all of items 4 and 5 yields a value of 611, which is higher than my outside offer, ensuring better than fallback scenario under initial conditions. While giving away all of items 1, 2, and 3 reduces potential material conflict.\n  \n  I should propose a counteroffer rather than walk in order to maximize my potential value under negotiation.\n\nHere is the counteroffer I will propose:\n- Give units to Player 2: 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5.\n\n```\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 632. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It is round 2, and Player 1 has offered me [4, 2, 2, 1, 0]. This means I would receive:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nMy private values are:\n- Item 1: 66\n- Item 2: 18\n- Item 3: 37\n- Item 4: 68\n- Item 5: 76\n\nThe value of this offer to me is:\n(4 * 66) + (2 * 18) + (2 * 37) + (1 * 68) + (0 * 76) = 264 + 36 + 74 + 68 + 0 = 442\n\nSince this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So, the present value of accepting this offer is 442 * 0.9 = 397.8\n\nMy outside offer value is 632. Since 397.8 is less than 632, accepting this offer is not beneficial.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. We want to find an offer that is better than 632/0.9 = 702.22 for me, and also potentially acceptable to Player 1. Since it is round 2, making a counteroffer that is rejected effectively ends the game with the outside offers. I will try to maximize the value I get while giving the minimum required to Player 1.\n\nMy current assessment is that Player 1 values item 1, 4. Lets make a new offer. I will offer:\n- 4 units of item 1\n- 2 units of item 2\n- 1 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\nThis gives me:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 * 66 = 0\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 * 18 = 0\n- 1 units of item 3: 1 * 37 = 37\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 * 68 = 340\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 76 = 152\nTotal value: 0 + 0 + 37 + 340 + 152 = 529.\n\nGiven my outside offer value of 632, and the current round is 2.\nMinimum value required to be better than walking away = 632/0.9 = 702.22\n\nTherefore, my counteroffer must give me at least this. The previous analysis was if I offered what I suggested above.\n\nLet me consider a different counteroffer:\n- 2 units of item 1\n- 1 units of item 2\n- 1 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nI would get:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 * 66 = 132\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 18 = 18\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 37 = 37\n- 5 units of item 4: 5 * 68 = 340\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 * 76 = 152\n\nTotal value: 132 + 18 + 37 + 340 + 152 = 679\nPresent value: 679*0.9 = 611.1\n\nSince this is still lower than 632, it is not better. I am better off walking.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action for Player 2 in round 1.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer to Player 2. The current offer on the table is [2, 1, 1, 1, 3], which means Player 2 receives:\n\n*   2 units of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   1 unit of item 3\n*   1 unit of item 4\n*   3 units of item 5\n\nPlayer 2's values for these items are:\n\n*   Item 1: 25\n*   Item 2: 85\n*   Item 3: 14\n*   Item 4: 36\n*   Item 5: 100\n\nSo the total value of the current offer to Player 2 is:\n\n(2 * 25) + (1 * 85) + (1 * 14) + (1 * 36) + (3 * 100) = 50 + 85 + 14 + 36 + 300 = 485\n\nNow, we need to compare this value to Player 2's outside offer, which is 1083. Since 485 < 1083, accepting the current offer is not a good option.\n\nNext, let's consider making a counteroffer. We need to decide how many units of each item to offer Player 1. Our goal is to maximize our value, taking into account the discount factor in future rounds. Let's think about the final round. In the final round, if we make a counter offer, it's treated as a walk. So Player 1 needs to offer us at least our outside value of 1083, adjusted by the discount factor in future rounds. Let's make an offer where we give player 1 just enough such that he is getting slightly more than giving us our outside offer in the last round. This approach might work.\n\nAlternatively, we could offer player 1 everything. In which case we get zero value, which is less than our walkaway value. This means the negotiations would have been useless.\n\nLet's try to aim for a slightly better deal. Since the value of the offer is so low, and there are two more rounds to play, lets make a counteroffer that is significantly more favorable to Player 2. The total units available are [5, 3, 3, 3, 6]. To offer a high amount to Player 2, we should keep the items we value most (2 and 5).\nIf Player 1 values item 1 most and item 5 least, it is possible that Player 1 values item 5 less than we do.\nLet's try offering Player 1 these amounts [3, 2, 2, 2, 4]. This means we keep [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]. The value of this to us is 2*25 + 1*85 + 1*14 + 1*36 + 2*100 = 50+85+14+36+200 = 385. This is still well below our walkaway value. So this is not the best approach.\n\nLet's offer slightly more such that the values are close to each other. Our outside offer is 1083.\n\nSince we value item 5 the most, let's keep all of item 5 for ourselves. And since we value item 2 second most, let's keep that as well. So let's offer 5, 3, 3, 3, 0 to Player 1, which means we get 0, 0, 0, 0, 6. This offer yields a value of 600 to us. Let's try to offer less to Player 1, so they would be more inclined to accept.\n\nLet's offer [4, 2, 2, 2, 1] to player 1. Then we keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 5]. Our value is 25 + 85 + 14 + 36 + 500 = 660.\n\nIt is likely we need to offer Player 1 something between our current value and the value that we would obtain by walking away. The value is approximately double to us if we walk away.\n\nLet's try offering [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1. This means we keep [3, 3, 3, 3, 6].\nOur value is 3*25 + 3*85 + 3*14 + 3*36 + 6*100 = 75 + 255 + 42 + 108 + 600 = 1080. This is very close to our walkaway value. Let's offer slightly less, so we obtain an even higher value to us.\n\nLet's offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means we keep [4, 3, 3, 3, 6].\nOur value is 4*25 + 3*85 + 3*14 + 3*36 + 6*100 = 100 + 255 + 42 + 108 + 600 = 1105. This is more than our walkaway value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 84. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 696 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

The current offer's value (9) is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n- **Previous Offer Made by Me in Round 1:** [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n  - Value if I keep: \n    - Item 1: \\( (5-2) \\times 10 = 30 \\)\n    - Item 2: \\( (3-1) \\times 53 = 106 \\)\n    - Item 3: \\( (3-1) \\times 84 = 168 \\)\n    - Item 4: \\( (3-1) \\times 27 = 54 \\)\n    - Item 5: \\( (6-3) \\times 58 = 174 \\)\n  - My total value = \\( 30 + 106 + 168 + 54 + 174 = 532 \\)\n  - After discount = \\( 532 \\times 0.9 = 478.8 \\)\n  \n- **Counteroffer Consideration:** I should make an offer that guarantees a total value greater than 84 for me. \n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accepting Current Offer:** Not an option because the value (9) is much less than my outside offer (84).\n- **Walking Away:** Could consider if unable to propose an offer more appealing to both.\n- **Proposing a Counteroffer:** My aim is to maximize the value to me while potentially appealing to Player 2 enough for them to agree. \n\n**Strategic Counteroffer:**\n- Keep more high-value and total items to myself to ensure I'm well above the 84 threshold.\n- Offer Player 2 just enough lower-value items to test their willingness to negotiate.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\n- **Give:** [1, 1, 0, 0, 2]\n  - Remaining for me:\n    - Item 1: \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\)\n    - Item 2: \\( 2 \\times 53 = 106 \\)\n    - Item 3: \\( 3 \\times 84 = 252 \\)\n    - Item 4: \\( 3 \\times 27 = 81 \\)\n    - Item 5: \\( 4 \\times 58 = 232 \\)\n  - Total value = \\( 40 + 106 + 252 + 81 + 232 = 711 \\)\n  - After discount = \\( 711 \\times 0.9 = 639.9 \\)\n\nGiven this analysis, here's the action I will take:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 234. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player1, 2 units of each item (keeping 2 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 933 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 0, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 1, and Player 1 has offered me [2, 4, 0, 3, 0]. This means they are offering me 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy values are:\nItem 1: 63\nItem 2: 18\nItem 3: 78\nItem 4: 52\nItem 5: 100\n\nMy outside offer is 234.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n(2 * 63) + (4 * 18) + (0 * 78) + (3 * 52) + (0 * 100) = 126 + 72 + 0 + 156 + 0 = 354\n\nThe current offer is worth 354 to me. Since 354 is greater than my outside offer of 234, accepting the offer is better than walking away immediately.\n\nHowever, it's only round 1, and there are potentially two more rounds of negotiation. This means I could potentially get an even better deal by making a counteroffer. Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 slightly more items. My goal is to figure out an offer where Player 1 accepts, resulting in value that exceeds 234 * 0.9 (taking discount factor into consideration).\n\nLet's try to calculate an optimal counteroffer. Since I value item 5 the highest, I would like to keep as much as possible. Player 1 offered me all of item 2, which has little value for me.\nI have: 4 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5. Player 1 offered: 2, 4, 0, 3, 0.\nThis implies Player 1 has: 2, 0, 1, 0, 1.\n\nMy value is 354, if I accept. Player 1 has: 2 * item1_value + 1 * item3_value + 1 * item5_value.\nIf I counter offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], then I would have 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 1 of item 5 = 3*63 + 4*18 + 1*78 + 3*52 + 1*100 = 189 + 72 + 78 + 156 + 100 = 595.\nIf I counter offer [3, 0, 1, 0, 1], I would have 1 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 3 of item 4, 0 of item 5 = 63+72+156 = 291.\nSo a more aggressive counteroffer would be better.\n\nThe current offer yields a good return, let me accept for now.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

It's crucial to assess offers primarily on their face value in round 1.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer value to me:** None (no current offer to evaluate)\n  \n- **Potential counteroffers:**\n  To evaluate potential counteroffers, I need to propose a division of items and calculate my total value from it.\n\n  **Example Counteroffer:**\n  - Offer 0 of each item to Player 2:\n  - Receive all items myself:\n    - Item 1: 9 units \u00d7 8 = 72\n    - Item 2: 5 units \u00d7 76 = 380\n    - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 61 = 122\n    - Item 4: 6 units \u00d7 70 = 420\n    - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 23 = 69\n    - Total value = 1063\n\nThis hypothetical example yields a value of 1063 to me, which is above my outside offer and the maximum possible value, confirming I must offer a reasonable division.\n\nLet's consider an offer to Player 2 that still provides me a value greater than 541:\n\n  **Balanced Counteroffer:**\n  - Offer 4 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2:\n  - I would receive:\n    - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 8 = 40\n    - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 76 = 228\n    - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 61 = 61\n    - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 70 = 210\n    - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 23 = 46\n    - My total value = 585\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- Since my example counteroffer value (585) is greater than my outside offer (541), and because it avoids giving away too much to Player 2, it seems like a reasonable initial offer.\n- This offer avoids Mistakes 1, 2, and 3, and leaves room for negotiation.\n\nGiven the analysis, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

If I keep everything and give player 1 nothing now, the discounted value to me is 548 * 0.9 = 493.2\nIf I give Player 1 all the items, it has a value of 0 to me.\n\nLet's go back to the offer I received. I calculate that my value of that offer is 154.8. If Player 1 values those items they received highly, then I should counteroffer with something close to this. I will ask for everything, keeping 0 of each item and offering the following to Player 1: [1,5,5,3,3]\n\nMy value would be 0, but accounting for the discounting factor, it would be 0 * 0.9 = 0. Walking away, my discounted value is 241/0.9 = 267.78.\nThis is bad.\n\nI think my best option is to walk away, as it is higher than the current discounted value of 154.8, which is the maximum I would get from accepting.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current offer and determine the best course of action.\n\nThe current offer to me is [2, 0, 0, 1, 2].

Since 235 is less than 251, accepting this offer would be worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To start, I will propose giving Player 1 exactly what they offered me, effectively requesting the remainder of the items.\n\nMy counteroffer will be: [4-2, 0-0, 1-0, 5-1, 3-2] = [2, 0, 1, 4, 1].\nIf player 1 accepts this counteroffer, it means that I will receive [2, 0, 0, 1, 2]. Which as we have calculated, has a value of 235 for me.\n\nTo beat my outside offer of 251, in the first round, let's see what a fair division will look like and if I would accept it. \nThe maximum value for me is 503. The maximum value for player 1 would also be 503.\nA fair division would be 503/2=251.5 for each player.\nThe player 1 is offering me an offer worth 235. If I accept this counter offer, it is not a fair trade.\n\nSo, instead of starting out with a counteroffer which I would walk away from, I will offer the player something closer to the outside offer of 251. So the value of my counteroffer is 251. \nIf they are rational, they would accept this because it means they get:\nItem 1: 4 - n1 units\nItem 2: 0 - n2 units\nItem 3: 1 - n3 units\nItem 4: 5 - n4 units\nItem 5: 3 - n5 units\n\nHowever, the other player has to accept the counteroffer. Thus I will make a counteroffer close to 251 but more likely for me to get accepted. \n\nLet's start with an offer worth 252.\nThe offer to player 1 should be worth 503 - 252 = 251.\n\nItem 1: Value is 80, number of units 4\nItem 2: Value is 63, number of units 0\nItem 3: Value is 11, number of units 1\nItem 4: Value is 17, number of units 5\nItem 5: Value is 29, number of units 3\n\nThe offer [2, 0, 0, 1, 2] is currently on the table, which is not good enough.\n\nSince I want to maximize the outcome of the negotiation game, I should make a counteroffer that is beneficial for me.\nIf I make a counteroffer, the other player might walk away. Thus the best strategy is to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means they want me to have 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.  I need to calculate the value of this offer to me and compare it to my outside offer.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 66\n- Item 2: 64\n- Item 3: 45\n- Item 4: 75\n- Item 5: 88\n\nSo, the value of their current offer to me is:\n(0 * 66) + (0 * 64) + (1 * 45) + (1 * 75) + (0 * 88) = 0 + 0 + 45 + 75 + 0 = 120\n\nMy outside offer is 127.  Since 120 < 127, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, considering the discount factor in future rounds. It's round 1, so the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.\n\nSince I have the following items: 1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 2 of item 5, I can calculate the total value of all these items as follows:\n(1 * 66) + (2 * 64) + (4 * 45) + (4 * 75) + (2 * 88) = 66 + 128 + 180 + 300 + 176 = 850.\n\nIf I were to give Player 1 everything, I would receive 0 value.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 11. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 828 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Hence, it's optimal to secure a good offer early.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is no current offer to accept, so I should consider making an initial counteroffer.\n   - **Potential counteroffer**:\n     - Let's consider a balanced counteroffer that maximizes my value while keeping an eye on fair distribution.\n     - For instance, I could initially propose to keep a large portion due to my high outside offer value while ensuring it is potentially tempting for the other player to consider.\n     - A proposed division might focus on securing more units of items with the highest value to me (items 4 and 5).\n\n3) Calculating a sample counteroffer:\n   - Keep all items 4 (7 units) and 5 (2 units):\n     - Value from item 4: 7 \u00d7 100 = 700\n     - Value from item 5: 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n     - Total value: 894\n   \n   - Give away most of the lower-valued items (to a degree that still ensures my value exceeds 408) to balance:\n     - Give away all 3 units of item 1 (3 \u00d7 19 = 57)\n     - Give away 4 units of item 2 (4 \u00d7 71 = 284)\n     - Give away 1 unit of item 3 (1 \u00d7 63 = 63)\n\n   Total value kept for me = 894, which is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 408.\n\nBased on this reasoning, here is the counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 1, 0, 0]}",

The current offer is worth 700, which is significantly greater.\n\n**Counteroffer Considerations:**\n\nSince this is round 1, I want to make a counteroffer that improves my position, but also leaves Player 1 with enough value that they are willing to continue negotiating. Let's think about a possible counteroffer.\n\n**Calculations for Keeping Everything:**\n\nIf I keep everything, the total value would be:\n\n*   (3 \\* 85) + (7 \\* 96) + (2 \\* 61) + (7 \\* 10) + (2 \\* 21) = 255 + 672 + 122 + 70 + 42 = 1161\n\nSince the initial offer of [3, 4, 1, 0, 0] to me yields a value of 700, it seems unlikely that any offer where I get to keep everything could be seen as beneficial.\n\nTo ensure that the other player also has a value that is larger than their outside offer, I must make sure that the number of items I give away makes sense. \n\n**Reasoning for Counteroffer:**\n\nSince I can't do better than accepting at the moment and it is the first round, I would like to try to improve the offer a bit for myself, but not so much that Player 1 walks away.\n\nThe current value to me is 700. I could walk away and get 32, but I should try to at least improve the offer.\n\nLet's test an example where the split is closer to equal. If I counter with:\n[2, 3, 1, 3, 1]\nPlayer 1 gets:\n[2, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n\nI would get:\nItem 1: 1 * 85 = 85\nItem 2: 4 * 96 = 384\nItem 3: 1 * 61 = 61\nItem 4: 4 * 10 = 40\nItem 5: 1 * 21 = 21\n\nTotal: 85 + 384 + 61 + 40 + 21 = 591\n\nThis is still larger than my outside offer, so it's worth considering this.\n\n**Action:**\n\nGiven the current offer and my outside offer, I should make a counteroffer to try and improve my outcome.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 328. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 675 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If I give Player 1 the following offer, I keep the remaining items:\n\nOffer: [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 2 units * 36 = 72\n- Item 2: 1 unit * 39 = 39\n- Item 3: 2 units * 27 = 54\n- Item 4: 1 unit * 3 = 3\n- Item 5: 1 unit * 48 = 48\n\nMy total value would be: 72 + 39 + 54 + 3 + 48 = 216\nSince 216 < 481, this counter offer is no good.\n\nLet's try offering more, such as offering Player 1 all of item 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nOffer: [4, 3, 5, 2, 0]\nMy value:\n- Item 1: 0 units * 36 = 0\n- Item 2: 0 units * 39 = 0\n- Item 3: 0 units * 27 = 0\n- Item 4: 0 units * 3 = 0\n- Item 5: 3 units * 48 = 144\nSince 144 < 481, this counter offer is also no good.\n\nOkay, let's try to offer only the minimum necessary to get more than the outside option after the discount.\n481 / 0.9 = 534.4\nSo I need to get at least 534 value to make it worth it, after offering Player 1 some units.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5.\n\nOffer: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nValue remaining:\n- Item 1: 3 * 36 = 108\n- Item 2: 2 * 39 = 78\n- Item 3: 4 * 27 = 108\n- Item 4: 2 * 3 = 6\n- Item 5: 3 * 48 = 144\nTotal = 108 + 78 + 108 + 6 + 144 = 444\n444 < 481. No good.\n\nI should just walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

To decide on a counteroffer, I need to think what player 1's valuation might be and if it can lead to a higher value in expectation. However, for round 1, a simple approach is to make a counteroffer that's only slightly more generous than the other party's offer, if their offer yields me greater value than my outside option.

I need to propose a division where my retained value is at least 626.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   Since my tentative counteroffer results in less value than my outside offer, I need to adjust it to increase my retained value, which might involve keeping more units of high-value items.\n\n   Let's adjust and offer:\n   - Item 1: 1 unit (5 kept)\n   - Item 2: 2 units (4 kept)\n   - Item 3: 0 units (3 kept)\n   - Item 4: 1 unit (1 kept)\n   - Item 5: 0 units (2 kept)\n\n   Check the retained value:\n   - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 34 = 170\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n   - 1 units of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n   - 2 unit of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n   - Total Value to Me = 525\n   \n   Even this value (525) is not enough to meet my outside offer.\n\nTo maximize my value, I will decrease the units given to others on high-value items further:\n\n   Revised Offer:\n   - Item 1: 0 units (6 kept)\n   - Item 2: 2 unit (4 kept)\n   - Item 3: 1 unit (2 kept)\n   - Item 4: 1 unit (1 kept)\n   - Item 5: 0 units (2 kept)\n\n   Check retained value:\n   - 6 units of item 1 = 6 \u00d7 34 = 204\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n   - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n   - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n   - Total Value to Me = 541\n\nThis allocation gives me a total value of 541, still not surpassing the 626 threshold, meaning the fair adjustment doesn't exist, forcing the halt in aggressive bidding of high-value items to Player 2 and granting sweeping re-distribution which only marginally improves my standing thus requiring me to adaptable and competitive.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 1, 1]}",

It's round 1, so no discount applies yet, but offers become less valuable as the game progresses.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - **Current offer**: None, so I cannot accept or evaluate a current offer.\n   - **Potential counteroffers**: Aim for a distribution where my total value is greater than 1108.\n   \n   Let's calculate a sample scenario where I keep most of the high-value items:\n   - Keeping all 6 units of item 4: \\(6 \\times 95 = 570\\)\n   - Keeping 1 unit of item 5: \\(1 \\times 98 = 98\\)\n   - Keeping 5 units of item 1, giving 2 to Player 2: \\(5 \\times 57 = 285\\)\n   - Keeping 2 units of item 2, giving 2 to Player 2: \\(2 \\times 38 = 76\\)\n   - Keeping 3 units of item 3, giving 2 to Player 2: \\(3 \\times 31 = 93\\)\n   \n   My total value from this split: \\(570 + 98 + 285 + 76 + 93 = 1122\\). This exceeds my outside offer of 1108, making it a potential valid offer.\n\n3) Make a Decision:\n   - I should not propose an offer worse for me than 1108.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my benefit while considering that no offer is on the table.\n   - The example division above gives me a better outcome than my outside offer, and I can adjust from there in future rounds if necessary.\n\nThus, my action will be to make a counteroffer that aligns with this distribution:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

To make a counteroffer worthwhile, it has to be significantly better than my outside option, especially considering the discount factor in later rounds.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I keep as much of the valuable items as possible and give Player 1 the rest.

Let's play with the value of x. If I offer player 1 [6, 3, 3, 8, 1] I keep [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] giving me value 0.\n\nIf I offer player 1 [6, 3, 3, 0, 1], this means I keep [0, 0, 0, 8, 0] giving me a value of 8 * 61 = 488. This is smaller than my outside offer so it's not good.\n\nI should try to keep items of type 2 to myself.\n\nLet me consider making a counteroffer where I keep all of item 2, as it is my most valuable item. I could offer Player 1 [6, 0, 3, 8, 1]. This means I keep [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. This gives me a value of 3 * 77 = 231, which is much lower than my outside offer.\n\nIt seems I need to make a counteroffer where I keep most of my items and give Player 1 a little bit of each.
