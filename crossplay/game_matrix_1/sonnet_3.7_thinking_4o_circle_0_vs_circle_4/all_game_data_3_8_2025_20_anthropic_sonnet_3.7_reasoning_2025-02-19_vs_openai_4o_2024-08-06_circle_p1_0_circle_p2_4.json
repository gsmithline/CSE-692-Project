By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This factor will influence the value of the outcome in future rounds, reducing it by 10% each round without an agreement.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer [2, 5, 0, 0, 0]**:\n\n   - Value from 2 units of Item 1: \\(2 \\times 42 = 84\\)\n   - Value from 5 units of Item 2: \\(5 \\times 28 = 140\\)\n\n   Total value if I accept: \\(84 + 140 = 224\\)\n\n   Comparing this with my outside offer of 446, the current offer is much lower in value.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffers**:\n\n   Let's consider a counteroffer that ensures my value is above my outside offer:\n\n   - As an example, consider keeping a high value primarily from Item 5 (highest value per unit):\n   \n     - Potential Counteroffer: Offer Player 1 [3, 3, 4, 3, 2] (to be negotiated such that my value maximizes)\n       - I keep: [2, 2, 3, 2, 2]\n\n   **Value from keeping these items**:\n   - 2 units of Item 1: \\(2 \\times 42 = 84\\)\n   - 2 units of Item 2: \\(2 \\times 28 = 56\\)\n   - 3 units of Item 3: \\(3 \\times 36 = 108\\)\n   - 2 units of Item 4: \\(2 \\times 49 = 98\\)\n   - 2 units of Item 5: \\(2 \\times 98 = 196\\)\n\n   Total value of this potential outcome: \\(84 + 56 + 108 + 98 + 196 = 542\\)\n\n   **Comparison**: \n   - This counteroffer value, 542, is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 446.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n1. **Current Offer Decision**: \n   - The current offer values only at 224, which is below my outside offer value of 446. Accepting it would be Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse than outside offer).\n\n2. **Counteroffer**:\n   - Given the above considerations, a counteroffer where I keep more units (especially high-value items like item 5) leads to a total value of 542, which is better than my outside offer.\n\n3. **Decision**: \n   - Since it's possible to make a valid counteroffer of sufficient value, I should propose a counteroffer aiming for this higher value.\n\nBased on my analysis, I will propose a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 4, 3, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Considering the discounting, this offer is equivalent to the value of walking away.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  - Propose a division yielding more than 245, keeping in mind the objective is to maximize your value above your outside offer of 245.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\n- **Considerations**:\n  - The value of accepting the current offer is equal to walking away, so it is not immediately compelling to accept.\n  - A better outcome could potentially be achieved in future rounds, but there's also the risk of Player 1 not being willing to improve their offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, I should aim for a counteroffer to maximize gains. A simple strategy would be to retain as many high-value items as possible. For instance, retaining more of Item 5 which is highest in value. \n\nPropose a counteroffer that targets maximizing total value by retaining the most valuable items for myself. I could offer Player 1 a reasonable quantity of low-value items to possibly reach a more favorable outcome, but ensuring my total is higher than 245 given the discount.\n\n### Suggested Counteroffer:\n\n- Keep all of Item 5 and propose a smaller portion of other items to Player 1. \n- Given limits, a simple starting counteroffer could be offering:\n  - Give Player 1: 1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, and minimum of Item 5 if possible (0 units to maximize my value).\n\nEvaluating that would lead us to the following proposed counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 3, 2, 0]}\n```\n\nThis assumes the configuration by checking values ensures you retain more item value than 245 after evaluation.",

In round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^0 = 1.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: [0, 2, 1, 0, 5]\n  - Item 1: 0 units \u2192 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n  - Item 2: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n  - Item 3: 1 unit \u2192 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n  - Item 4: 0 units \u2192 0 \u00d7 51 = 0\n  - Item 5: 5 units \u2192 5 \u00d7 56 = 280\n  - Total Value = 0 + 176 + 19 + 0 + 280 = 475\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**: \n  - Value of accepting the current offer (475) is significantly higher than my outside offer value (59).\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?** \n  - The current offer of 475 is much better than the outside offer of 59.\n- **Mistake Check**:\n  - Accepting a deal worse than the outside offer would be a mistake. Here, accepting the current offer is not a mistake as it provides a value greater than my outside offer.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, accepting the current offer is highly beneficial as it's substantially more valuable than walking away with the outside offer.\n\n**Decision**:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 295.\n   \n   - **Values of the Items:**\n     - Item 1: 81 per unit\n     - Item 2: 31 per unit\n     - Item 3: 95 per unit\n     - Item 4: 51 per unit\n     - Item 5: 63 per unit\n   \n   - **Total Pool of Items:**\n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 1 unit of item 3\n     - 0 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   \n   - **Discount Factor:** The discount factor, gamma, is 0.9. This means the value we calculate will be multiplied by gamma to the power of (r-1) depending on the round, where r is the current round number. Currently, it is round 1, so gamma has no effect (0.9^(1-1) = 1).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer (Offered to Me):** [2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n     - Value of 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n     - Value of 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 95 = 0\n     - Value of 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 51 = 0\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n     - Total value = 162 + 31 + 0 + 0 + 63 = 256\n   \n   The total value of the current offer (256) is less than my outside offer (295).\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffer:**\n     - I need to propose a distribution where the total value to me is greater than my outside offer of 295, taking care not to make Mistakes 2, 3, and 5.\n\n     Suppose I counteroffer such that I maximize items with higher value to me. \n\n     For example:\n     - 5 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5:\n       - Value of 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 81 = 405\n       - Value of 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 31 = 0\n       - Value of 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n       - Value of 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 51 = 0\n       - Value of 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n       - Total value = 405 + 0 + 95 + 0 + 189 = 689\n   \n     This maintains a high value for me and ensures I'm not making Mistake 2 or 5.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on Analysis:**\n\n   Since the current offer (256) is lower than my outside offer (295), I should not accept it. Proposing a counteroffer that maximizes my value makes more sense.\n\n   **Counteroffer Proposal:**\n   I will offer Player 1 the remaining units assuming the proposed split I calculated and ensuring it's valid by not exceeding available items:\n   - Offer: [2, 1, 0, 0, 1] (Give Player 1: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5)\n\n   However, I've noticed an error here since Items 2 and 5 offer cannot happen. I will adjust it:\n   - Offer the remaining - let me adjust once more:\n   - Give Player 1: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 2, 0 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n   \n   Therefore, my revised counteroffer would be:\n   [2, 0, 1, 0, 1] - This better reflects balance and doesn't lose good items.\n\n   **Final Decision:**\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 1, 0, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 7, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 7, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Walking away or counteroffering runs the risk of receiving a worse offer or being forced to resort to the outside offer, both of which are less favorable based on the current offer presented.\n\nThus, the appropriate action is to accept the current offer.\n\n**Decision**:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 97. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 309 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that if the negotiation extends to more rounds, the value of the agreed outcome will be reduced according to this factor. However, in the first round, the discount does not apply as it's \\(0.9^{0} = 1\\).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer**: [1, 1, 2, 4, 0]\n  - Value Calculation:\n    - 1 unit of item 1: \\(1 \\times 78 = 78\\)\n    - 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 37 = 37\\)\n    - 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 36 = 72\\)\n    - 4 units of item 4: \\(4 \\times 83 = 332\\)\n    - 0 units of item 5: \\(0 \\times 88 = 0\\)\n  - Total value of current offer: \\(78 + 37 + 72 + 332 + 0 = 519\\)\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n  - The total value of the current offer (519) is significantly less than my outside offer (1005).\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- **Accept**: Cannot accept, as the current offer (519) is less than my outside offer (1005).\n- **Walk Away**: This ensures a guaranteed value of 1005, but prevents further negotiation attempts which might yield a better deal.\n- **Counteroffer**: I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a total value greater than 1005 while still being reasonable.\n\n### Constructing a Counteroffer:\nI need to propose a division where my total value exceeds 1005. Therefore, I'll aim to keep items that give me high value per unit.\n\n- **Initial Allocation (to me)**:\n  - Item 1: 4 (Value: \\(4 \\times 78 = 312\\))\n  - Item 2: 3 (Value: \\(3 \\times 37 = 111\\))\n  - Item 3: 0 (Value: \\(0 \\times 36 = 0\\))\n  - Item 4: 0 (Value: \\(0 \\times 83 = 0\\))\n  - Item 5: 2 (Value: \\(2 \\times 88 = 176\\))\n\n- **Proposing this offers Player 1**:\n  - Item 1: 2\n  - Item 2: 2\n  - Item 3: 2\n  - Item 4: 4\n  - Item 5: 0\n\nTotal value for me in this counteroffer: \\(312 + 111 + 0 + 0 + 176 = 599\\)\n\nSince the counteroffer setup above incorrectly assumes total values differently than initially matched to item worth; I shall proceed otherwise with reviewing multipliers:\n\nReconsidering valid allocation:\n- Item 1: Receive 6\n- Item 2: Receive 3 \n- Item 3: Receive 0 \n- Item 4: Receive 0 \n- Item 5: Receive 2\n\nThis clearly preserves higher premised points' validity above 1005 while also remedying earlier albeit improper subdivisions oversights!\n\nConsequently, I pronounce this:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 4, 0]}\n```\n\nThis counterproposal addresses a re-allocation per unity without traversing potential resource compromises.",

It indicates that the value of accepting an offer decreases over time if it requires another round, multiplying the value by 0.9^(r-1), where r is the round number.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value ([3, 7, 0, 0, 0]):**\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240\n  - 7 units of item 2 = 7 \u00d7 79 = 553\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 72 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n  - Total value = 240 + 553 = 793\n\n- **Value Compared to Outside Offer:** 793 (current offer) vs. 557 (outside offer). The current offer value is higher than my outside offer. \n\n- **Discounted Current Offer Value:** \n  - Since it is round 1, there is no discount applied (as (r-1) = 0 makes gamma^(r-1) = 1). The value remains 793.\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision based on the analysis\n\nGiven that the current offer's value (793) is greater than my outside offer value (557) and taking into account that the discount factor does not influence the current round's decision adversely, accepting this offer is beneficial. \n\nAlso, none of the strategic mistakes (like accepting an offer worse than the outside offer or making worse counteroffers) apply here if I accept this offer.\n\nThus, my action will be to accept the current offer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

Since we're in round 2, any value obtained should be multiplied by 0.9, but walking away means you receive your outside offer with no discount.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**: [3, 0, 1, 1, 1] (units being offered to you)\n   - Value calculation:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n   - Total value = 198 + 95 + 86 + 93 = 472\n   - Discounted value for round 2 = 472 \u00d7 0.9 = 424.8\n\n2. **Comparing Values**:\n   - Current offer value (discounted) = 424.8\n   - Outside offer = 529\n   - The current offer is less valuable than the outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n1. **Accept Current Offer?**\n   - No, because 424.8 (current offer value) < 529 (outside offer).\n\n2. **Walk Away?**\n   - Walking away guarantees a value of 529, which is better than accepting the current offer.\n\n3. **Make a Counteroffer?**\n   - To be profitable, the counteroffer should aim to give Player 1 a fair share while increasing your value above 529.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer:\n\nTo ensure the counteroffer maximizes your value:\n\n- Propose giving Player 1: [3, 0, 0, 1, 0], keeping:\n  - For yourself: [3, 1, 5, 3, 1] minus what is given:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n    - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 95 = 475\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n  - Total Value = 1050\n\nThis counteroffer guarantees a better value than your outside offer and avoids the mistakes outlined.\n\nTherefore, the action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

In this round, the value is not affected by the discount factor since it is round 1 (discount factor affects from round 2).\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current offer on the table [0, 0, 1, 4, 1]:**\n  - Item 1: 0 units = 0\n  - Item 2: 0 units = 0\n  - Item 3: 1 unit = 96\n  - Item 4: 4 units = 276\n  - Item 5: 1 unit = 3\n  - **Total value of current offer to me:** 96 + 276 + 3 = 375\n  - **Comparison to outside offer value:** The current offer value (375) is less than my outside offer (478).\n\n- **Assess potential counteroffers:**\n  - Since the current offer is less valuable than my outside offer, I need to consider proposing a counteroffer that maximizes my value, ensuring it doesn't go below 478.\n\n    Assuming I propose keeping:\n    - 3 units of item 1 (maximum value from items)\n    - 2 units of item 3 (nearly my maximum valued item)\n    - 0 units of item 4 (since it has been offered almost completely to me, reducing its counter value)\n    - A mix of items 2 and 5, focusing on retaining maximum value.\n\n    I calculate possible division scenarios to ensure I retain a value above my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Decision:\n- **ACCEPT:** Reject as the current offer value (375) is below my outside offer (478).\n- **WALK:** Not optimal since there is potential to negotiate a better value.\n- **COUNTEROFFER:** Propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value:\n  - Offer Player 1 relatively less valuable combinations but ensure I get more than 478 in value.\n\nAn example of a counteroffer I can propose:\n- Give Player 1:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 4 units of item 5\n\nMy counteroffer [0, 2, 1, 0, 4] ensures I keep:\n\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 84 = 252\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 69 = 276\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\nTotal value = 252 + 36 + 192 + 276 + 3 = 759\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer by a significant margin and ensures a better deal based on my item valuations.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 0, 4]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If I decide to wait for future offers, the overall value of the negotiation will be multiplied by this discount factor, reducing the potential value over time.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 1 is [1, 2, 0, 3, 1]. This means Player 1 is keeping:\n     - 1 unit of item 1, worth 73\n     - 2 units of item 2, worth 2\n     - 0 units of item 3, worth 0\n     - 3 units of item 4, worth 138\n     - 1 unit of item 5, worth 39\n   - Total value if I accept the current offer = 73 + 2 + 0 + 138 + 39 = 252.\n   - My outside offer value is 365, which is higher than my value of the current offer (252).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer's value (252) is less than my outside offer value (365).\n   - Accepting this offer would be a mistake because it yields less than my outside offer.\n   - I should not walk away immediately as it's only the first round, and bargaining could potentially lead to a better offer or counteroffer.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that provides higher value than my outside offer.\n\nNow, let's consider a potential counteroffer:\n   - I want to achieve a total value greater than 365.\n   - Consider keeping items with the highest value per unit for me, such as items 1 and 3.\n\nLet's propose:\n   - I take 2 units of item 1 (worth 146 to me)\n   - I take 4 units of item 3 (worth 324 to me)\n   - I give away all of item 2 (4 units, worth 4 to me), all of item 4 (5 units, worth 230 to me), and 1 unit of item 5 (worth 39 to me to balance the value for Player 1)\n   \n   Total value for me from this division = 146 + 324 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 470.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 4, 2, 5, 1]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the best course of action, let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** The outside offer value is 551.\n- **Values of the Items Involved:**\n  - Item 1: 27 (though irrelevant here as there are 0 units)\n  - Item 2: 7\n  - Item 3: 50\n  - Item 4: 68\n  - Item 5: 91\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 0 units\n  - Item 2: 8 units\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 4: 4 units\n  - Item 5: 4 units\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. As we are in round 1, the discount factor won't reduce the present value, but it will influence if there are further rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of the Current Offer\n\n**Current Offer to Me:** [0, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n\n- Value of 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 27 = 0\n- Value of 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- Value of 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n- Value of 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n- Value of 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 91 = 91\n\n**Total Value of Current Offer to Me:** 0 + 14 + 50 + 204 + 91 = 359\n\n### Step 3: Compare and Decide\n\n- **Current Offer Value (359) vs. Outside Offer (551):** The current offer is worth 359, which is less than my outside offer of 551.\n- **Decision:** According to Mistake 4, I should not accept an offer that is worse than my outside offer.\n\nSince accepting the current offer would give me less value than my guaranteed outside offer, I should **not** accept.\n\n### Consider a Counteroffer\n\nTo avoid making Mistake 2 (offering something worse than my outside offer), any counteroffer should have a value to me that exceeds 551.\n\nA potential counteroffer might involve keeping more high-value items. Here's one possible option:\n\n- Let me keep all units of items 1 and 3-5, and offer Player 1 most of item 2, which is the least valuable to me:\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:** Offer Player 1: [0, 6, 1, 0, 2] (give away more of the less valuable items)\n\n- **My kept items: [0, 2, 5, 4, 2]**\n\nValue of kept items:\n- Value of 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n- Value of 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 50 = 250\n- Value of 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\n- Value of 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n\n**Total Value of Kept Items:** 0 + 14 + 250 + 272 + 182 = 718\n\n718 exceeds my outside offer of 551, making this a reasonable counteroffer.\n\n### Action\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 6, 1, 0, 2]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 6, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 4, 1, 3, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze the current offer and decide whether to accept, walk away, or make a final counteroffer in this last round.\n\nFirst, let me calculate the value of the current offer to me:\n- Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 99 = 0\n- Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 41 = 164\n- Item 3: 6 units \u00d7 89 = 534 (since I'm getting all 6)\n- Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 3 = 6\n- Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 44 = 132 (since I'm getting 3 out of 4)\n\nTotal value of the current offer: 0 + 164 + 534 + 6 + 132 = 836\n\nThis is in round 3, so the discount factor is 0.9\u00b2 = 0.81, making the actual value to me: 836 \u00d7 0.81 = 677.16\n\nMy outside offer is 145, which is much lower than the 677.16 I'd get from accepting.\n\nLet me see if I can improve with a counteroffer. My ideal would be to keep all the high-value items (items 3 and 2), and give away the low-value items (item 4).\n\nLet me try a final counteroffer: [0, 3, 0, 4, 2]\nThis would mean I keep:\n- 0 of item 1 (there are none)\n- 5 of item 2 (worth 205)\n- All 6 of item 3 (worth 534)\n- 0 of item 4 (worth 0)\n- 2 of item 5 (worth 88)\n\nMy total: 827 \u00d7 0.81 = 669.87\n\nWait, this is actually worse than accepting the current offer. The current offer is better for me because Player 2 is giving me 4 of item 2, letting me keep 6 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n\nSince this is the final round and any counteroffer by me would lead to the discount factor being applied, and my calculation shows accepting is better than my best counteroffer, I should accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
