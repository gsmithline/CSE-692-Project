                    "response": "Okay, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to determine my BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement), which is my outside offer of 800. I need to make an offer that, considering the discount factor, is better than 800.\n\nNext, I want to determine how to maximize my potential gain. I need to offer Player 2 enough to make them accept, but not more than necessary. This is complicated by the fact that I don't know Player 2's values.\n\nA reasonable starting point is to offer a split that gives Player 2 approximately half of the total possible value, *assuming* they have similar values to me. The total value of all the items to me is 3*80 + 6*71 + 6*53 + 3*59 + 3*11 = 240 + 426 + 318 + 177 + 33 = 1194. Half of that is about 597. So I should give them amounts that they value at approximately 597.\n\nI need to decide on the allocation of each item to Player 2. Let's aim for a relatively even split.\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 1 unit. My value for remaining 2 is 160.\n*   Item 2: Offer 3 units. My value for remaining 3 is 213.\n*   Item 3: Offer 3 units. My value for remaining 3 is 159.\n*   Item 4: Offer 1 unit. My value for remaining 2 is 118.\n*   Item 5: Offer 1 unit. My value for remaining 2 is 22.\n\nThis gives Player 2 a proposed value of 1*80 + 3*71 + 3*53 + 1*59 + 1*11 = 80 + 213 + 159 + 59 + 11 = 522 based on my values. If Player 2 has similar values to me, this is below half, which is probably a bit too low to get an immediate accept. Let's increase the offer slightly.\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 1 unit. My value for remaining 2 is 160.\n*   Item 2: Offer 4 units. My value for remaining 2 is 142.\n*   Item 3: Offer 3 units. My value for remaining 3 is 159.\n*   Item 4: Offer 1 unit. My value for remaining 2 is 118.\n*   Item 5: Offer 1 unit. My value for remaining 2 is 22.\n\nThis gives Player 2 a proposed value of 1*80 + 4*71 + 3*53 + 1*59 + 1*11 = 80 + 284 + 159 + 59 + 11 = 593.\n\nMy value would be 160+142+159+118+22 = 601. This is less than my outside option of 800. So, let me make a different counteroffer, one where I keep more items.\n\nLet's try offering:\n\n* Item 1: 0 units to Player 2, keep 3 for myself.\n* Item 2: 2 units to Player 2, keep 4 for myself.\n* Item 3: 2 units to Player 2, keep 4 for myself.\n* Item 4: 0 units to Player 2, keep 3 for myself.\n* Item 5: 0 units to Player 2, keep 3 for myself.\n\nValue to Player 2 based on my values = 0 + 2*71 + 2*53 + 0 + 0 = 142 + 106 = 248.\nValue to myself = 3*80 + 4*71 + 4*53 + 3*59 + 3*11 = 240 + 284 + 212 + 177 + 33 = 946. This is much greater than my outside offer of 800, so it would be profitable for me if Player 2 accepted.\n\nGiven the discount factor of 0.9, accepting a deal worth slightly less than my outside option in round 1 is still preferable to walking away and getting my outside option in later rounds.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 38 x 0 + 31 x 4 + 70 x 2 + 60 x 3\n    which is 444 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 445. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less than offers in earlier rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 0].

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 445. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 0 + 38 x 0 + 31 x 4 + 70 x 2 + 60 x 3\n    which is 444 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 445. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

My outside offer is 438. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the current offer:\n* Item 1: 2 * 31 = 62\n* Item 2: 0 * 4 = 0\n* Item 3: 2 * 47 = 94\n* Item 4: 2 * 73 = 146\n* Item 5: 0 * 53 = 0\nTotal value of current offer = 62 + 0 + 94 + 146 + 0 = 302\n\nSince it is round 2, we should also discount the outside offer.\nDiscounted outside offer value = 438 * 0.9 = 394.2\n\nSince the current offer (302) is less than my discounted outside offer (394.2), I shouldn't accept it.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to walk or make a counteroffer. Let's analyze the previous round's offers:\n* Round 1, Player 1 offered: [2, 2, 2, 2, 1] (meaning I give away these amounts).\n* Round 1, Player 2 offered: [2, 0, 2, 2, 0] (current offer)\n\nMy initial thought is to try to get a better deal by offering something slightly more favorable to Player 2 than my round 1 offer, while still exceeding my discounted outside offer. However, since this is round 2, there's only one round remaining, so it might be more advantageous to simply WALK if I can't get significantly better. I will aim for a counter offer that will get me closer to my outside offer.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer where I give the other player: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0].

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 3, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 2 + 98 x 4 + 69 x 3 + 36 x 4 + 37 x 0\n    which is 791 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 792. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of the items received, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 times the value.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 1, 0].

Let's calculate my value if I keep different amounts of the items and offer the rest.\n\n   - **If I offer [4, 3, 4, 3, 2], I keep [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], total value 227.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 792. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 3, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 2 + 98 x 4 + 69 x 3 + 36 x 4 + 37 x 0\n    which is 791 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 792. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 469\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 44, Item 2: 95, Item 3: 59, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 48\n*   **Total items:** 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [2, 1, 2, 1, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   2 units of item 1: 2 * 44 = 88\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 95 = 95\n    *   2 units of item 3: 2 * 59 = 118\n    *   1 unit of item 4: 1 * 1 = 1\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 48 = 0\n    *   Total value of current offer: 88 + 95 + 118 + 1 + 0 = 302\n\n    Since 302 < 469, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 469. Let's calculate the total value of all items to me: (5 * 44) + (3 * 95) + (4 * 59) + (3 * 1) + (1 * 48) = 220 + 285 + 236 + 3 + 48 = 792. Therefore, I need to keep at least 469/95 approx 4 units of item 2 to achieve my outside offer without even considering other items\n    Let's consider an offer where I give Player 1 only the minimum amount necessary. Since Item 2 has the highest unit value, it is likely to be fought over. An offer giving all of the items apart from four units of item 2 is worse than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's consider a different counteroffer. I offer Player 1 [3, 2, 3, 2, 1]. This means I keep:\n    * 2 units of item 1: 2 * 44 = 88\n    * 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 95 = 95\n    * 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 59 = 59\n    * 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 1 = 1\n    * 0 units of item 5: 0 * 48 = 0\n    * Total value: 88 + 95 + 59 + 1 = 243\n    Since 243 < 469, it is a poor offer.\n\n    Let's consider another counteroffer. Since item 2 is valuable, I will make sure I keep all of that. I offer Player 1 [5, 0, 4, 3, 1]. This means I keep:\n    * 0 units of item 1: 0 * 44 = 0\n    * 3 units of item 2: 3 * 95 = 285\n    * 0 unit of item 3: 0 * 59 = 0\n    * 0 unit of item 4: 0 * 1 = 0\n    * 0 units of item 5: 0 * 48 = 0\n    * Total value: 285\n    Since 285 < 469, it is a poor offer.\nI will make the offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. In this case I receive 4*44 + 3*95 + 3*59 + 3*1 + 1*48 = 176 + 285 + 177 + 3 + 48 = 689. This is higher than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept. I will make a counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Let's aim for a value around 550 (to account for the discount factor and give myself some margin). Then I will be giving the remaining amount of these items to the other player. My goal is to extract as much value as possible from the other player.\n\nLet's try offering the player a small amount of each item to start with.\n\nOffer Player 2: [4, 2, 3, 2, 1]\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 1 unit  (1 * 38 = 38)\nItem 2: 1 unit  (1 * 60 = 60)\nItem 3: 1 unit  (1 * 67 = 67)\nItem 4: 1 unit  (1 * 97 = 97)\nItem 5: 0 unit  (0 * 43 = 0)\nTotal value for me: 38 + 60 + 67 + 97 + 0 = 262\n\nSince 262 * 0.9 = 235.8, which is much less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering something which will be a win-win.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 4, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 2 + 95 x 1 + 59 x 4 + 1 x 1 + 48 x 1\n    which is 468 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 469. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 469. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 4, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 2 + 95 x 1 + 59 x 4 + 1 x 1 + 48 x 1\n    which is 468 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 469. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 735\n*   My values for items: item 1: 77, item 2: 44, item 3: 41, item 4: 9, item 5: 9\n*   Total items: item 1: 8, item 2: 2, item 3: 3, item 4: 0, item 5: 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: I am offered [4, 1, 1, 0, 2].  This means I keep:\n    *   item 1: 8 - 4 = 4 units\n    *   item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   item 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   item 4: 0 - 0 = 0 units\n    *   item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    My value for the current offer is: (4 * 77) + (1 * 44) + (2 * 41) + (0 * 9) + (2 * 9) = 308 + 44 + 82 + 0 + 18 = 452.\n    Since 452 < 735, accepting this offer would be worse than my outside option.  It violates Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.\n\n*   Potential counteroffers: I want to find an offer that gives me more than 735.\n\n    *   Let's calculate my value if I keep everything:\n        (8 * 77) + (2 * 44) + (3 * 41) + (0 * 9) + (4 * 9) = 616 + 88 + 123 + 0 + 36 = 863.  This is the maximum possible value I can get.\n\n    *   To make an acceptable counteroffer, I need to give Player 1 some items. I will try to give the items I value less.\n        Let's start by trying to offer Player 1 only item 5:\n        If I offer Player 1 all 4 units of item 5, I keep [8, 2, 3, 0, 0]. Then, my value is (8 * 77) + (2 * 44) + (3 * 41) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 9) = 616 + 88 + 123 + 0 + 0 = 827 > 735\n        So, I can offer Player 1 all item 5 and still get a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n*   The current offer is unacceptable.\n*   Walking away gives me 735.\n*   I can make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer. I'll offer Player 1 all of item 5, and adjust the other items such that Player 1 receives more than their original offer and I also receive more than my outside offer.\nLet's offer [4, 1, 1, 0, 4]. Then I keep [4, 1, 2, 0, 0]. My value is (4 * 77) + (1 * 44) + (2 * 41) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 9) = 308 + 44 + 82 = 434\nThis is lower than my current offer, so lets adjust.\n\nLet's offer player 1 2 of item 3, and I keep 1. So the counteroffer will be [4, 1, 2, 0, 4].\nThen I keep [4, 1, 1, 0, 0]. My value is (4 * 77) + (1 * 44) + (1 * 41) = 308 + 44 + 41 = 393\nThis is lower than my previous assessment of the offer.\nSo, I will give Player 1 all of item 5, and improve Player 1's offer of item 1 and item 2.\nThe new counteroffer will be [5, 2, 1, 0, 4]\n\nMy kept items are [3, 0, 2, 0, 0] which has a value of (3 * 77) + (0 * 44) + (2 * 41) + (0 * 9) + (0 * 9) = 231 + 0 + 82 = 313.\nThis is still lower than my current offer.\n\nLet me offer my best offer. The previous offer from player 1 was [4, 1, 1, 0, 2] which had a value of 452.\nI can offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 4] which has a kept value of (8 * 77) + (2 * 44) + (3 * 41) = 827, which is much larger than 735.\nHowever this will not work. Let me reaccess the situation.\n\nThe other person is getting at round 1: [4, 1, 1, 0, 2]. The total value I am getting at round 1: 452.\n\nLet me counter offer the player with some amount of item 1 such that it is bigger than the current offer. My current best offer has failed.\nI will offer player 1 item 1, item 2, and item 5, and split item 3. The counter offer is [4, 1, 1, 0, 2]. Then I keep:\nitem 1: 8 - 4 = 4 units\nitem 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\nitem 3: 3 - 1 = 2 units\nitem 4: 0 - 0 = 0 units\nitem 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\nMy value for the current offer is: (4 * 77) + (1 * 44) + (2 * 41) + (0 * 9) + (2 * 9) = 308 + 44 + 82 + 0 + 18 = 452. This will not work.\n\nI believe that a more optimal solution does not exist, and thus I will WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

My outside offer is 273.\n\n2.  **Total Items:** There are 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n\n3.  **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value, but it must be at least as good as my outside offer of 273.\n\n4.  **Round 1 Strategy:** Since I'm Player 1 and it's the first round, I need to make an initial offer. I want to make an offer that is attractive enough for Player 2 to accept, or at least to counter, giving me more information about their preferences. I should aim for a distribution that gives me a decent value, potentially higher than my outside offer, anticipating that I might have to concede a little in later rounds due to the discount factor.\n\n5.  **Initial Offer Calculation:** Let's start by calculating the value of keeping everything for myself and offering nothing. That would be 3\\*37 + 2\\*43 + 2\\*91 + 6\\*10 + 5\\*68 = 111 + 86 + 182 + 60 + 340 = 779. This is my maximum possible value.\n\n6.  **Making an Initial Offer:** I need to offer Player 2 something. If I offer Player 2 half of each item (where possible), that could be a good starting point. However, since I value item 3 highly, I don't want to give much of it away. Similarly, I don't value item 4 very much.\n\nHere's an offer I'll make: Give Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nThis means I keep: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\nMy value for this would be 2\\*37 + 1\\*43 + 2\\*91 + 3\\*10 + 3\\*68 = 74 + 43 + 182 + 30 + 204 = 533.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 0 + 37 x 1 + 35 x 2 + 48 x 5 + 43 x 2\n    which is 433 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 434. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 434\n*   Item values: item 1 = 54, item 2 = 37, item 3 = 35, item 4 = 48, item 5 = 43\n*   Total items: 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  Since it's round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1.  This means the current value is not discounted.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 54) + (1 * 37) + (0 * 35) + (3 * 48) + (2 * 43) = 54 + 37 + 0 + 144 + 86 = 321\n*   Comparison to outside offer: 321 < 434. Accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n\nI need to make a counteroffer that is worth more than 434 to me. The current offer leaves me with:\n* item 1: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n* item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n* item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n* item 4: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n* item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n\nMy value if I keep everything is:\n(3 * 54) + (2 * 37) + (2 * 35) + (6 * 48) + (5 * 43) = 162 + 74 + 70 + 288 + 215 = 809.\n\nLet's try to figure out a good counteroffer. I want to give away items that I value less and keep items that I value more. I want to aim for slightly more than my outside offer to leave room for negotiation.\n\nLet's try keeping 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 4 of item 4 and 4 of item 5\n\nThen my value will be\n\n(2 * 54) + (1 * 37) + (1 * 35) + (4 * 48) + (4 * 43) = 108 + 37 + 35 + 192 + 172 = 544\n\nThis is a decent starting point, and giving [1, 1, 1, 2, 1] to player 1 would likely be something player 1 wouldn't refuse immediately.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (321) is less than my outside offer (434), I should not accept. I will make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 2, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 434. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 0 + 37 x 1 + 35 x 2 + 48 x 5 + 43 x 2\n    which is 433 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 434. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 4, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 4, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 2 = 1\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 4 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2\n\n    My value for accepting this offer would be:\n    (1 * 54) + (1 * 37) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 48) + (2 * 43) = 54 + 37 + 35 + 96 + 86 = 308\n\n    Since 308 is less than my outside offer of 434, accepting this offer is not a good idea.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer. I will start by trying to get close to an even split, while also offering items that I value less. Let's try offering Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]:\n\n    *   Item 1: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 3 = 3\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3\n\n    My value for this counteroffer would be:\n    (2 * 54) + (1 * 37) + (1 * 35) + (3 * 48) + (3 * 43) = 108 + 37 + 35 + 144 + 129 = 453\n\n    Since 453 is greater than my outside offer of 434, this is a viable counteroffer. Let's calculate the discounted value of the outside offer after two rounds. 434 * (0.9^1) = 390.6. Since 453 > 390.6, offering this counteroffer is still a better option than walking away.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nI should propose a counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 3, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 78 x 1 + 1 x 0 + 67 x 6 + 45 x 2\n    which is 570 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 571. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's consider what would happen if I offered Player 2 the complement of my optimal allocation. My optimal allocation, ignoring player 2's values, would be to keep all the items.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 0 + 78 x 1 + 1 x 0 + 67 x 6 + 45 x 2\n    which is 570 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 571. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 571\n*   My values per item: item 1: 67, item 2: 78, item 3: 1, item 4: 67, item 5: 45\n*   Total items: item 1: 1, item 2: 2, item 3: 4, item 4: 6, item 5: 4\n*   Discount factor: 0.9. This means accepting an offer in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value of accepting in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 2, 3, 2]. This means I keep [1, 1, 2, 3, 2] for myself.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 67) + (1 * 78) + (2 * 1) + (3 * 67) + (2 * 45) = 67 + 78 + 2 + 201 + 90 = 438\n    *   Adjusted for discount: 438 * 0.9 = 394.2\n    *   Since 394.2 is less than my outside offer (571), accepting is not a good choice.\n\n*   **Consider some counteroffers:** I need to keep at least 571/0.9 = 634.4444... to be better off than my outside offer.\n   \n    *   If I offer [0, 0, 4, 6, 4], meaning I keep [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]: My value: (1 * 67) + (2 * 78) + (0 * 1) + (0 * 67) + (0 * 45) = 67 + 156 = 223. This is terrible!\n\n    *   Let's try to make an offer where I keep more items. How about offering only item 1 and 2:\n    * If I offer [1, 2, 0, 0, 0] - I keep items [0, 0, 4, 6, 4]. Then value = 4*1 + 6*67 + 4*45 = 4+402+180= 586\n    * Value adjusted for discount: 586 * 0.9 = 527.4 This is still less than the outside offer\n    \n     * Let's offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] - I keep items [0, 1, 4, 6, 4]. Then value = 1*78 + 4*1 + 6*67 + 4*45 = 78+4+402+180= 664\n    * Value adjusted for discount: 664 * 0.9 = 597.6. This is better than the outside offer\n    \n    \n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer of [0, 1, 2, 3, 2] is worth less than my outside offer, so I should reject.\n*   The offer of [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] (giving 1 of item 1, and 1 of item 2 to Player 1) leaves me with a discounted value of 597.6, which is higher than my outside offer of 571.\n*   So, I will make that counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 6, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 0 + 36 x 1 + 16 x 5 + 23 x 6 + 6 x 3\n    which is 272 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 273.

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 273.\n   - My values for the items are: item 1 = 92, item 2 = 36, item 3 = 16, item 4 = 23, item 5 = 6.\n   - The total pool of items is: 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 5 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. Since this is round 1, the discount factor doesn't affect the current decision.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 0, 2, 3, 2]. This means I keep:\n      - Item 1: 1 unit (2 total - 1 offered = 1 kept)\n      - Item 2: 1 unit (1 total - 0 offered = 1 kept)\n      - Item 3: 3 units (5 total - 2 offered = 3 kept)\n      - Item 4: 3 units (6 total - 3 offered = 3 kept)\n      - Item 5: 3 units (5 total - 2 offered = 3 kept)\n      - Value of current offer: (1 * 92) + (1 * 36) + (3 * 16) + (3 * 23) + (3 * 6) = 92 + 36 + 48 + 69 + 18 = 263\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** The value of the current offer (263) is less than my outside offer (273). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n3) **Develop a Counteroffer**\n\nI want to propose a counteroffer that secures a value greater than my outside offer of 273. Let's explore some options.\n\n* **Option 1: Keeping all of item 1 and item 2.** This gives me 92 * 2 + 36 * 1 = 184 + 36 = 220. I need at least 53 more in value from item 3, 4, and 5 combined.\n\n* **Option 2: Try to get more of item 1** Say, I propose to give them nothing of item 1, so they get zero. This means I keep both of them, and the value I gain is 184. I also keep 1 item of item 2 and so, my current value is 220, and I am still looking for other items to increase my value of 273 or higher.\nLet's try keeping [2, 1, 3, 3, 3].  This offer would be to give [0, 0, 2, 3, 2]. Value for me is (2*92) + (1*36) + (3*16) + (3*23) + (3*6) = 184 + 36 + 48 + 69 + 18 = 355. This is much greater than my outside option.\n\nLet's consider the offer where I keep [2, 1, 5, 6, 5], giving the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The value for me is (2*92) + (1*36) + (5*16) + (6*23) + (5*6) = 184+36+80+138+30 = 468. In this case, I should offer at least one item to the other player (Mistake 3).\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer of [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. I keep [2, 1, 4, 5, 4].  Value is (2*92) + (1*36) + (4*16) + (5*23) + (4*6) = 184 + 36 + 64 + 115 + 24 = 423\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer of [0, 0, 2, 2, 2]. I keep [2, 1, 3, 4, 3].  Value is (2*92) + (1*36) + (3*16) + (4*23) + (3*6) = 184 + 36 + 48 + 92 + 18 = 378\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer of [0, 0, 3, 3, 3]. I keep [2, 1, 2, 3, 2].  Value is (2*92) + (1*36) + (2*16) + (3*23) + (2*6) = 184 + 36 + 32 + 69 + 12 = 333\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer of [0, 0, 4, 4, 4]. I keep [2, 1, 1, 2, 1].  Value is (2*92) + (1*36) + (1*16) + (2*23) + (1*6) = 184 + 36 + 16 + 46 + 6 = 288\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer of [0, 0, 2, 3, 2]. I keep [2, 1, 3, 3, 3]. Value is (2*92) + (1*36) + (3*16) + (3*23) + (3*6) = 184 + 36 + 48 + 69 + 18 = 355.\n\nBased on these calculations, a good counteroffer would be to offer [0, 0, 2, 3, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 3, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 0 + 73 x 1 + 98 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 79 x 3\n    which is 310 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 311. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 5 + 30 x 1 + 44 x 2 + 78 x 3 + 34 x 0\n    which is 567 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 568. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 568\n*   Item values: Item 1 = 43, Item 2 = 30, Item 3 = 44, Item 4 = 78, Item 5 = 34\n*   Total items: 8 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. The discount factor reduces the value of accepting offers in later rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This means I would get:\n    *   2 units of item 1 = 2 * 43 = 86\n    *   0 units of item 2 = 0 * 30 = 0\n    *   1 units of item 3 = 1 * 44 = 44\n    *   1 units of item 4 = 1 * 78 = 78\n    *   0 units of item 5 = 0 * 34 = 0\n    *   Total value = 86 + 0 + 44 + 78 + 0 = 208\n*   This value (208) is significantly less than my outside offer (568).\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers. I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Let's try keeping [5, 1, 2, 3, 0]. Value = 43 x 5 + 30 x 1 + 44 x 2 + 78 x 3 + 34 x 0 = 215 + 30 + 88 + 234 + 0 = 567. This is just below my outside offer, so it is not good enough\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** To improve on this offer, let's increase the amount of item 1 that I keep by 1 to get 6. Then value is 43x6 + 30x1 + 44x2 + 78x3 + 34x0 = 258 + 30 + 88 + 234 = 610, exceeding the outside offer and therefore acceptable. The proposed split would therefore be keeping [6, 1, 2, 3, 0] and offering [2, 0, 3, 1, 1]\n    *  **Counteroffer 3:** Keeping [7, 1, 3, 2, 1], value would be 43*7 + 30*1 + 44*3 + 78*2 + 34 = 301 + 30 + 132 + 156 + 34 = 653. The proposed split would be keeping [7,1,3,2,1] and therefore offering [1, 0, 2, 2, 0].\n    *  **Counteroffer 4:** Keeping [8, 1, 4, 1, 1], value would be 43*8 + 30 + 44*4 + 78 + 34 = 344 + 30 + 176 + 78 + 34 = 662. The proposed split would be keeping [8,1,4,1,1] and therefore offering [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is terrible.\n*   Walking away would give me 568.\n*   I should make a counteroffer that gives me more than 568.\n*   Based on the analysis, counteroffer 2 would give a value of 610 and counteroffer 3 would give a value of 653.\n*   Let's go with counteroffer 3 as it maximizes my outcome.

I will offer Player 2:\n\n- Item 1: 6 units\n- Item 2: 0 units\n- Item 3: 1 units\n- Item 4: 1 units\n- Item 5: 0 units\n\nThis means I would receive:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 4 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThe value to me would be:\n(2 * 50) + (1 * 5) + (4 * 85) + (3 * 31) + (1 * 94) = 100 + 5 + 340 + 93 + 94 = 632\n\nThe present value is 632 * 0.9 = 568.8.\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer value, so I will revise the counteroffer and offer more items. I want the outcome to be closer to my outside offer of 788 after applying the discount.\n\nNew counteroffer (offer to Player 2):\n- Item 1: 4 units\n- Item 2: 0 units\n- Item 3: 0 units\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 0 units\n\nThis means I would receive:\n- Item 1: 4 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 5 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nThe value to me would be:\n(4 * 50) + (1 * 5) + (5 * 85) + (4 * 31) + (1 * 94) = 200 + 5 + 425 + 124 + 94 = 848\n\nThe present value is 848 * 0.9 = 763.2.\n\nEven this is slightly lower than my outside offer.\nLet's make a final adjustment to squeeze the last bit out:\n\nCounteroffer:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 0 units\n- Item 3: 0 units\n- Item 4: 0 units\n- Item 5: 0 units\n\nThis means I receive:\n- Item 1: 5 units\n- Item 2: 1 units\n- Item 3: 5 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nValue:\n(5 * 50) + (1 * 5) + (5 * 85) + (4 * 31) + (1 * 94) = 250 + 5 + 425 + 124 + 94 = 898\n\nPresent Value: 898 * 0.9 = 808.2\n\nThis is greater than 788.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 8 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 43 for item 1, 30 for item 2, 44 for item 3, 78 for item 4, 34 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 940. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 568. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 568. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 1, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 5 + 30 x 1 + 44 x 2 + 78 x 3 + 34 x 0\n    which is 567 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 568. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 568\n*   Item values: Item 1: 43, Item 2: 30, Item 3: 44, Item 4: 78, Item 5: 34\n*   Total items: Item 1: 8, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 1\n*   Discount factor: 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of its value in round 2, and round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am offered [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 8 - 3 = 5\n    *   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 0 = 5\n    *   Item 4: 4 - 0 = 4\n    *   Item 5: 1 - 0 = 1\n\n    My value for this offer: (5 * 43) + (1 * 30) + (5 * 44) + (4 * 78) + (1 * 34) = 215 + 30 + 220 + 312 + 34 = 811\n    Since 811 > 568, accepting this offer is better than walking away *now*. However, we need to consider the discount factor and potential for a better offer.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's consider some options, keeping in mind the goal is to get above 568 after accounting for gamma.\n    *   A very basic counteroffer - giving back the 3 units of item 1 in exchange for all of item 4. I offer [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. That leaves me with [8, 1, 5, 0, 1], which is worth 8*43 + 1*30 + 5*44 + 0*78 + 1*34 = 344+30+220+0+34=628. It would be worth considering a 0.9 discount factor in the next round, if the current offer is turned down.\n    *   A counteroffer where Player 1 gets item 1 but I keep the valuable item 4. Offer [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I would keep [0, 1, 5, 4, 1] with value 0*43+1*30+5*44+4*78+1*34 = 0+30+220+312+34=596. This is also better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\n*   The current offer of [3, 0, 0, 0, 0] is worth 811 to me. This is significantly better than my outside offer of 568.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. If I reject this and Player 1 rejects my next offer and I accept their offer in round 3, I will get 0.9*0.9 of this value.\n*   However, I can make a counteroffer to potentially get more value.\n\nGiven that the current offer is much higher than my outside option, I would prefer to make a counteroffer. Let's try to get Player 1 to give up all of item 4 by giving back item 1.\nI will offer Player 1 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 0 units of item 5. This means I keep all of item 1 (8 units), all of item 2 (1 unit), all of item 3 (5 units), none of item 4 and all of item 5 (1 unit). That gives me a value of 8*43+1*30+5*44+0*78+1*34 = 344+30+220+0+34 = 628, which is a good starting point, and better than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]}\n```",

This is less than my outside offer of 531.\n\nLet's try another offer, aimed to secure me at least 531.\n\nOffer:\n*   Item 1: Give 2 to Player 2\n*   Item 2: Give 0 to Player 2\n*   Item 3: Give 3 to Player 2\n*   Item 4: Give 1 to Player 2\n*   Item 5: Give 1 to Player 2\n\nNow, let's calculate what that leaves me:\n*   Item 1: 3 * 33 = 99\n*   Item 2: 2 * 75 = 150\n*   Item 3: 2 * 2 = 4\n*   Item 4: 3 * 84 = 252\n*   Item 5: 1 * 56 = 56\n\nTotal Value to me of this offer: 99 + 150 + 4 + 252 + 56 = 561.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 319. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 948 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 0 + 76 x 1 + 29 x 2 + 48 x 0 + 92 x 2\n    which is 318 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 319. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\nThe current offer is [2, 0, 3, 1, 1], meaning I receive 2 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\nMy value for this offer is:\n(2 * 71) + (0 * 76) + (3 * 29) + (1 * 48) + (1 * 92) = 142 + 0 + 87 + 48 + 92 = 369\n\n3) **Compare to outside offer:**\n\nThe current offer's value (369) is greater than my outside offer (319).\n\n4) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nBefore accepting, let's briefly consider if there is a significantly better counteroffer.  If I were to keep everything, my total value would be:\n(5 * 71) + (2 * 76) + (5 * 29) + (4 * 48) + (2 * 92) = 355 + 152 + 145 + 192 + 184 = 1028\nI am unlikely to get everything, and making a counteroffer delays things and thus has a discount rate applied to the value.\nIt is unlikely that there is a much better offer than the current one that is likely to be accepted.\nFor example, if I offer player 1 zero of each item type, then I would have [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n71 * 0 + 76 * 0 + 29 * 0 + 48 * 0 + 92 * 0 = 0\nWhich is less than my outside offer.\n\n5) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer (369) is greater than my outside offer (319), and because any counteroffer has a discount rate applied to it, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   1 unit of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    My value for this offer would be: (1 * 44) + (2 * 18) + (1 * 78) + (0 * 80) + (1 * 69) = 44 + 36 + 78 + 0 + 69 = 227\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (227) is less than my outside offer (289). Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to calculate a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 289. Let's start by considering what I would get if I gave Player 1 nothing and kept everything for myself:\n    *   4 units of item 1 = 4 * 44 = 176\n    *   5 units of item 2 = 5 * 18 = 90\n    *   4 units of item 3 = 4 * 78 = 312\n    *   2 units of item 4 = 2 * 80 = 160\n    *   5 units of item 5 = 5 * 69 = 345\n    Total value = 176 + 90 + 312 + 160 + 345 = 1083\n\n    Since my total value is 1083, I can certainly construct a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer of 289. I want to keep as much of the high value items (3, 4, and 5) as possible.\n\n    Let's try to find a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a bit more than what they initially requested, but still leaves me with a good value. For instance, giving Player 1 [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]:\n     * I keep [3, 2, 3, 1, 4]\n     * My value = 3*44 + 2*18 + 3*78 + 1*80 + 4*69 = 132 + 36 + 234 + 80 + 276 = 758\n\n    Okay that is much better than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   I should not accept the current offer (value 227 < outside offer 289).\n*   I should not walk away (I can potentially get a much better deal).\n*   I should make a counteroffer. The counteroffer I calculated above yields a value of 758 for me.\n\nTherefore, I will make the counteroffer [1, 3, 1, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    44 x 0 + 18 x 3 + 78 x 3 + 80 x 0 + 69 x 0\n    which is 288 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 289. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

My goal is to maximize my discounted value while ensuring the offer is attractive enough for Player 2 to accept it, either now or in a later round. A fair starting point is to offer Player 2 a split that gives me more than my outside option, while ensuring player 2 also gets a reasonable offer.\n\nLet's consider giving half of each item to player 2, rounding up where necessary.\n*   Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2 (leaving 1 for me)\n*   Item 2: 3 units to Player 2 (leaving 2 for me)\n*   Item 3: 2 units to Player 2 (leaving 1 for me)\n*   Item 4: 1 unit to Player 2 (leaving 0 for me)\n*   Item 5: 2 units to Player 2 (leaving 1 for me)\n\nThis gives Player 2: [1, 3, 2, 1, 2].

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 68. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 45 x 0 + 28 x 0 + 57 x 1\n    which is 57 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 68. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 68\n*   My values for items: item 1: 95, item 2: 43, item 3: 45, item 4: 28, item 5: 57\n*   Total pool of items: item 1: 2, item 2: 5, item 3: 3, item 4: 1, item 5: 3\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9.  The current round is 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5. My value for this offer is: (1 * 95) + (2 * 43) + (1 * 45) + (0 * 28) + (1 * 57) = 95 + 86 + 45 + 0 + 57 = 283. Since it's round 2, we multiply by the discount factor of 0.9: 283 * 0.9 = 254.7.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer, valued at 254.7, is significantly better than my outside offer of 68.\n\n3) **Consider Counteroffers:**\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a fair share while ensuring I get a value greater than 68. Since I can accept the current offer, let's try to find an alternative that's close to the current offer, to see if I can make it even better.\nCurrent offer is [1,2,1,0,1]. Which means Player 1 gets [1, 3, 2, 1, 2]\nNow, let's consider an offer where I give Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n\n*   **Counteroffer:**  I offer Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I keep [2, 4, 3, 1, 3].\n    My value for this counteroffer: (2 * 95) + (4 * 43) + (3 * 45) + (1 * 28) + (3 * 57) = 190 + 172 + 135 + 28 + 171 = 696.\n    Discounted value = 696*0.9 = 626.4. This is a very good outcome.\n\n    So, an offer like this could potentially be accepted in the next round.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe current offer on the table gives me a discounted value of 254.7. This is much larger than my outside option of 68. Thus, accepting is a good choice.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 6, 8, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 63 x 6 + 36 x 8 + 56 x 2 + 77 x 2\n    which is 943 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 944. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n    - My outside offer value is 944.\n    - Item values: Item 1 = 11, Item 2 = 63, Item 3 = 36, Item 4 = 56, Item 5 = 77.\n    - Total items: Item 1 = 2, Item 2 = 7, Item 3 = 9, Item 4 = 2, Item 5 = 4.\n    - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that any deal made in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and a deal made in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means they are offering 0 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\n    - Value of current offer: (0 * 11) + (1 * 63) + (1 * 36) + (0 * 56) + (0 * 77) = 99.\n    - Since 99 is significantly less than my outside offer of 944, accepting is not a good option.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:** I need to determine a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 944. Let's aim for a deal that gives me at least this much.\n    - Total value of all items to me: (2 * 11) + (7 * 63) + (9 * 36) + (2 * 56) + (4 * 77) = 22 + 441 + 324 + 112 + 308 = 1207.\n    - Now let's think about a reasonable counteroffer. I want to keep most of the valuable items (item 2 and item 5). Let's start by offering Player 1 half the items. We need to calculate how much of each item I need to keep to exceed my outside offer.\n    - After some experimentation, consider the offer [1, 3, 4, 1, 2]. This means I keep [1, 4, 5, 1, 2]. The value I keep is:\n        - (1 * 11) + (4 * 63) + (5 * 36) + (1 * 56) + (2 * 77) = 11 + 252 + 180 + 56 + 154 = 653\n        - Still too low.\n\n    - Try offering [0, 2, 4, 0, 0]. This leaves me with [2, 5, 5, 2, 4]. Value for me: (2*11) + (5*63) + (5*36) + (2*56) + (4*77) = 22 + 315 + 180 + 112 + 308 = 937\n\n    - Now offer [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]. This leaves me with [2, 6, 6, 2, 4]. Value for me: (2*11) + (6*63) + (6*36) + (2*56) + (4*77) = 22 + 378 + 216 + 112 + 308 = 1036 > 944\n\n    - Therefore, offering [0, 1, 3, 0, 0] gives me a better value.\n\n4) **Make a decision:** I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and the current offer on the table is [0, 1, 3, 0, 0]. This means Player 2 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of this offer to me:\n* 0 units of item 1 * 43 = 0\n* 1 unit of item 2 * 90 = 90\n* 3 units of item 3 * 31 = 93\n* 0 units of item 4 * 12 = 0\n* 0 units of item 5 * 8 = 0\nTotal value = 0 + 90 + 93 + 0 + 0 = 183\n\nNow, I need to discount this value by the discount factor gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\nDiscounted value = 183 * 0.9 = 164.7\n\nMy outside offer is 858. Since the discounted value of the current offer (164.7) is significantly lower than my outside offer (858), I should not accept this offer.\n\nLet's consider making a counteroffer. I have the following items: 2 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\n\nTo maximize my value, I want to keep as much of item 2 as possible. I also want to get as many of their items as possible for things I value more. Given that they offered me 1 unit of item 2 and 3 of item 3, it sounds like they value item 2 less and item 3 higher. So, I will offer them most of my item 3 and item 5 to see if I can get more of their item 2.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I give them a good amount of item 3 and item 5.\nCounteroffer: [2, 0, 6, 2, 4]. This means I offer Player 2:\n* 2 units of item 1\n* 0 units of item 2\n* 6 units of item 3\n* 2 units of item 4\n* 4 units of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n* 0 units of item 1\n* 7 units of item 2\n* 3 units of item 3\n* 0 units of item 4\n* 0 units of item 5\nValue for myself: 0*43 + 7*90 + 3*31 + 0*12 + 0*8 = 0 + 630 + 93 + 0 + 0 = 723\nDiscounted value: 723 * 0.9 = 650.7\nThis is still smaller than my outside offer. Let's try a much more aggressive offer.\n\nCounteroffer: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep everything.\nValue for myself: 2*43 + 7*90 + 9*31 + 2*12 + 4*8 = 86 + 630 + 279 + 24 + 32 = 1051\nDiscounted value: 1051 * 0.9 = 945.9\n\nSince 945.9 > 858, this is a better deal.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 6, 8, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 63 x 6 + 36 x 8 + 56 x 2 + 77 x 2\n    which is 943 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 944. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your value would be:\n    30 x 1 + 91 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 86 x 8 + 32 x 4\n    which is 846 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 847. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 4, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 3, 4, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 847\n*   My values of the items: 30 for item 1, 91 for item 2, 54 for item 3, 86 for item 4, 32 for item 5.\n*   Total pool of items: 5 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its value in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   Current offer: Player 1 offers me [2, 1, 3, 4, 3]. This means I get 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n\n    Value of accepting the current offer:\n    (2 * 30) + (1 * 91) + (3 * 54) + (4 * 86) + (3 * 32) = 60 + 91 + 162 + 344 + 96 = 753\n\n    Since 753 is less than my outside offer of 847, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   Potential counteroffers:\n    I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 847. Let's try to calculate what I would get if I demand that I keep everything.\n    (5*30)+(3*91)+(6*54)+(8*86)+(6*32) = 150 + 273 + 324 + 688 + 192 = 1627.\n    This means the most amount I could ever get is 1627.\n\n    Now, let's explore some counteroffers that give me more value than 847. One strategy is to offer Player 1 close to the minimal amount for each item.\n\n    Let's try offering [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to player 1. This means I keep [4, 2, 5, 7, 5].\n    Value = (4 * 30) + (2 * 91) + (5 * 54) + (7 * 86) + (5 * 32) = 120 + 182 + 270 + 602 + 160 = 1334\n    Since 1334 is greater than my outside offer of 847, this could be a good starting point.\n\n    Let's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. This means I keep [5, 3, 6, 8, 6].\n    Value = (5 * 30) + (3 * 91) + (6 * 54) + (8 * 86) + (6 * 32) = 150 + 273 + 324 + 688 + 192 = 1627\n\n    Let's try offering [3, 2, 4, 5, 4] to player 1. This means I keep [2, 1, 2, 3, 2].\n    Value = (2 * 30) + (1 * 91) + (2 * 54) + (3 * 86) + (2 * 32) = 60 + 91 + 108 + 258 + 64 = 581\n    This is less than my outside option.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   I will make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.\n*   I will offer [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

I will offer Player 2 slightly more than half of each item to start with, aiming to secure a deal above my outside offer while leaving room for negotiation.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 8, 1, 3, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 0 + 91 x 8 + 72 x 1 + 90 x 3 + 54 x 5\n    which is 1340 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1345.

My outside offer is 286.\n\nSince there's no current offer, I need to make the first move. My goal is to get a deal that's worth more than 286 after discounting (if applicable). I need to think about what a reasonable offer would be to entice Player 2 to accept. I don't know Player 2's values, so I'm operating in the dark to some extent.\n\nA completely fair split would be giving Player 2 half the total value of all goods and I keep half. This is a starting point only and will be adjusted based on my outside offer of 286.\nThe total number of items is 1+1+3+3+2 = 10. My total value for all the items is (1 * 25) + (1 * 34) + (3 * 68) + (3 * 30) + (2 * 89) = 25 + 34 + 204 + 90 + 178 = 531.\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's values, a \"fair\" offer, from my perspective, would be one that gives Player 2 roughly half the total value, *according to my values*. This is an imperfect method, but it's a reasonable starting point in the absence of any information about Player 2's preferences. Of course, I need to also ensure that my remaining value is above 286. The alternative would be to offer a minimal amount to Player 2 to secure maximum value and see if they accept it.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 2 just enough such that I am left with items worth more than my outside option. Since it's Round 1, no discount rate applies yet.\n\nMy outside option is 286. I want to keep at least that much value for myself. So I can give away a maximum of 531 - 286 = 245 worth of value.\nThe offer should be optimized in order to accomplish this target amount.\nThe highest value item is item 5, followed by item 3, then item 2, then item 4 and finally item 1.\nLet's try giving away 1 item 5 (value=89), 0 item 3, 1 item 2 (value=34), 1 item 4 (value=30), and 0 item 1. This would give a value to player 2 of 89+0+34+30+0=153, and a value to me of 531-153=378 > 286. This is acceptable.\nAnother option is to give 1 item 5, 1 item 3, 0 item 2, 0 item 4, and 0 item 1. This would be worth 89+68=157.\nAnother option: 0 item 5, 2 item 3, 1 item 2, 0 item 4, 0 item 1. Value: 2*68+34=136+34=170\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 1 unit of item 5, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 37 x 1 + 80 x 0 + 79 x 0 + 32 x 2\n    which is 101 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 104. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means I receive:\n     - 0 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 0 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   - My total value if I accept the offer is: (0 * 45) + (1 * 37) + (0 * 80) + (1 * 79) + (1 * 32) = 0 + 37 + 0 + 79 + 32 = 148.\n\n3) **Assess potential counteroffers:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 148 to me, which is greater than my outside option of 104. However, I wonder if I can get a better deal.\n\nLet's evaluate some options:\n*   **Keeping everything:** This would give me 45 * 1 + 37 * 1 + 80 * 3 + 79 * 3 + 32 * 2 = 45 + 37 + 240 + 237 + 64 = 623\n*   **Offering the player [1, 1, 3, 3, 2]:** I get nothing, so the total value would be zero.\n*   **Offering the player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:** I keep everything for 623.\n\nThe current offer of 148 is better than my outside offer of 104, so I should not WALK.\n\nI will attempt to make a counteroffer that gives me a better value. I need to keep at least item 3 and item 4. \nLet's consider the current offer to me of [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]. My current resources are [1, 1, 3, 3, 2]. So, Player 1 has offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] to me and must have the offer [1, 0, 3, 2, 1].\n\nLet's calculate some scenarios for my counteroffer, and what I would get if I gave that counteroffer:\n* Offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] --> I get [1, 1, 3, 3, 2], which is a value of 623.\n* Offer [1, 1, 3, 3, 2] --> I get [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which is a value of 0.\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer where I keep most of what I want. The counteroffer is to give the Player 1 the following:\nCounteroffer = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This would give me: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]. Which is worth 45 + 37 + 160 + 158 + 64 = 464.\n\n**Decision:**\nSince the current offer of 148 is better than my outside offer of 104, but I think I can do better, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 37 x 1 + 80 x 0 + 79 x 0 + 32 x 2\n    which is 101 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 104. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Note that fractional amounts aren't possible, so I'll round down.\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 1 unit (leaving 2 for me)\n*   Item 2: Offer 2 units (leaving 2 for me)\n*   Item 3: Offer 1 unit (leaving 2 for me)\n*   Item 4: Offer 0 units (leaving 1 for me)\n*   Item 5: Offer 1 unit (leaving 2 for me)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 * 33 = 66\n*   Item 2: 2 * 11 = 22\n*   Item 3: 2 * 10 = 20\n*   Item 4: 1 * 37 = 37\n*   Item 5: 2 * 93 = 186\n*   Total Value: 66 + 22 + 20 + 37 + 186 = 331\n\n331 is much less than my outside offer, so I will try to be more strategic. I will keep Items 4 and 5 since they are my highest value items. Then, I will divide items 1, 2, and 3 roughly in half.\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 1 unit (leaving 2 for me)\n*   Item 2: Offer 2 unit (leaving 2 for me)\n*   Item 3: Offer 1 unit (leaving 2 for me)\n*   Item 4: Offer 0 units (leaving 1 for me)\n*   Item 5: Offer 0 units (leaving 3 for me)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 * 33 = 66\n*   Item 2: 2 * 11 = 22\n*   Item 3: 2 * 10 = 20\n*   Item 4: 1 * 37 = 37\n*   Item 5: 3 * 93 = 279\n*   Total Value: 66 + 22 + 20 + 37 + 279 = 424\n\nThis is still not above my outside offer of 479. Let me try an offer where I keep all of item 5.\n*   Item 1: Offer 1 unit (leaving 2 for me)\n*   Item 2: Offer 2 unit (leaving 2 for me)\n*   Item 3: Offer 1 unit (leaving 2 for me)\n*   Item 4: Offer 0 units (leaving 1 for me)\n*   Item 5: Offer 0 units (leaving 3 for me)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 * 33 = 66\n*   Item 2: 2 * 11 = 22\n*   Item 3: 2 * 10 = 20\n*   Item 4: 1 * 37 = 37\n*   Item 5: 3 * 93 = 279\n*   Total Value: 66 + 22 + 20 + 37 + 279 = 424\nLet's try keeping items 4 and 5.\n*   Item 1: Offer 2 unit (leaving 1 for me)\n*   Item 2: Offer 3 unit (leaving 1 for me)\n*   Item 3: Offer 2 unit (leaving 1 for me)\n*   Item 4: Offer 0 units (leaving 1 for me)\n*   Item 5: Offer 0 units (leaving 3 for me)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of what I would keep:\n\n*   Item 1: 1 * 33 = 33\n*   Item 2: 1 * 11 = 11\n*   Item 3: 1 * 10 = 10\n*   Item 4: 1 * 37 = 37\n*   Item 5: 3 * 93 = 279\n*   Total Value: 33 + 11 + 10 + 37 + 279 = 370\nStill below. Now, let's only give away Item 1.\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 3 unit (leaving 0 for me)\n*   Item 2: Offer 0 unit (leaving 4 for me)\n*   Item 3: Offer 0 unit (leaving 3 for me)\n*   Item 4: Offer 0 units (leaving 1 for me)\n*   Item 5: Offer 0 units (leaving 3 for me)\n\nValue of keeping all other items:\n\n*   Item 1: 0 * 33 = 0\n*   Item 2: 4 * 11 = 44\n*   Item 3: 3 * 10 = 30\n*   Item 4: 1 * 37 = 37\n*   Item 5: 3 * 93 = 279\n*   Total Value: 0 + 44 + 30 + 37 + 279 = 390\n\nLet's be less extreme, but favor keeping the more valuable items for myself.\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 1\n*   Item 2: Offer 2\n*   Item 3: Offer 1\n*   Item 4: Offer 0\n*   Item 5: Offer 0\n\n*   Item 1: 2 * 33 = 66\n*   Item 2: 2 * 11 = 22\n*   Item 3: 2 * 10 = 20\n*   Item 4: 1 * 37 = 37\n*   Item 5: 3 * 93 = 279\n*   Total Value: 66 + 22 + 20 + 37 + 279 = 424\n\nLet's try\n\n*   Item 1: Offer 0\n*   Item 2: Offer 1\n*   Item 3: Offer 0\n*   Item 4: Offer 0\n*   Item 5: Offer 0\n\n*   Item 1: 3 * 33 = 99\n*   Item 2: 3 * 11 = 33\n*   Item 3: 3 * 10 = 30\n*   Item 4: 1 * 37 = 37\n*   Item 5: 3 * 93 = 279\n*   Total Value: 99 + 33 + 30 + 37 + 279 = 478\n\nOkay, let's offer the following:\n*   Item 1: Offer 0\n*   Item 2: Offer 0\n*   Item 3: Offer 0\n*   Item 4: Offer 0\n*   Item 5: Offer 0\n\n*   Item 1: 3 * 33 = 99\n*   Item 2: 4 * 11 = 44\n*   Item 3: 3 * 10 = 30\n*   Item 4: 1 * 37 = 37\n*   Item 5: 3 * 93 = 279\n*   Total Value: 99 + 44 + 30 + 37 + 279 = 489\nThis is the total value.\nI want at least 479, my outside offer.\n\nSo, let's try a small offer.\n*   Item 1: Offer 0\n*   Item 2: Offer 1\n*   Item 3: Offer 0\n*   Item 4: Offer 0\n*   Item 5: Offer 0\n\n*   Item 1: 3 * 33 = 99\n*   Item 2: 3 * 11 = 33\n*   Item 3: 3 * 10 = 30\n*   Item 4: 1 * 37 = 37\n*   Item 5: 3 * 93 = 279\n*   Total Value: 99 + 33 + 30 + 37 + 279 = 478\n\nThis is just below my outside offer.

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 31 for item 1, 16 for item 2, 98 for item 3, 75 for item 4, 71 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 739. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 680. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 680. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 3, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 1 + 16 x 4 + 98 x 3 + 75 x 1 + 71 x 3\n    which is 677 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 680. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This means that an agreement in round 2 is worth 0.9 times the value, and an agreement in round 3 is worth 0.81 times the value. Waiting for future offers decreases the potential value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: Player 1 is offering me [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 3. My value for this offer is 1 * 98 = 98. This is significantly less than my outside offer of 680.\n   - Potential counteroffers: I need to find a division of items that gives me a value greater than 680.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me a value of 98, which is much lower than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away would give me a value of 680.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 680.

I want to get at least my outside offer value of 479 back.\n\nSince I have 489 as my full value I want to retain around 244.5 value (half the total value, roughly, so about half of the items).\n\nLet's see what items are valuable for me: items 1, 4, and 5 are most valuable to me, so I will try to retain those, while offering up items 2 and 3 if possible.\n\nHow about I offer the other player all of Item 2 (4 units) and all of Item 3 (3 units)?\n\nThen I would keep:\n- 3 units of item 1 (99)\n- 0 units of item 2 (0)\n- 0 units of item 3 (0)\n- 1 unit of item 4 (37)\n- 3 units of item 5 (279)\nTotal: 99 + 0 + 0 + 37 + 279 = 415\nThis is not enough, it is less than my outside offer.\n\nAnother idea: I offer all of item 2 and some of item 1. \nI offer:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 4 units of item 2\n- 3 units of item 3\n- 0 unit of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\nThen I keep:\n- 2 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\nTotal: 2*33 + 0 + 0 + 37 + 3*93 = 66 + 37 + 279 = 382\n\nSince the discount factor applies, I need to get more back to get to a value above 479. I need to at least propose a trade where I receive an immediate value of 479/0.9=532.\n\nLet me offer only items 2 and 3.\nCOUNTEROFFER: [0, 4, 3, 0, 0]\nThen I keep:\n- 3 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\nTotal: 3*33 + 0 + 0 + 37 + 3*93 = 99 + 37 + 279 = 415\ndiscounted value = 415 * 0.9 = 373.5\n\nLet me offer items 2, 3 and some of item 1:\nCOUNTEROFFER: [1, 4, 3, 0, 0]\nThen I keep:\n- 2 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\nTotal: 2*33 + 0 + 0 + 37 + 3*93 = 66 + 37 + 279 = 382\ndiscounted value = 382 * 0.9 = 343.8\n\nSince it is only round 2, and I can't get a better deal, I should just walk.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

However, given my values, I should try to keep more of the items I value highly (1, 2, 4) and give more of the items I value less (3, 5) to Player 2. This potentially gives Player 2 a deal they're more likely to accept, while still maximizing my own utility.\n\nLet's start with an offer where I give Player 2:\nItem 1: 2 units\nItem 2: 3 units\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 2 units\nItem 5: 5 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 2 units (2 * 96 = 192)\nItem 2: 4 units (4 * 79 = 316)\nItem 3: 2 units (2 * 33 = 66)\nItem 4: 3 units (3 * 56 = 168)\nItem 5: 4 units (4 * 5 = 20)\n\nTotal value for me: 192 + 316 + 66 + 168 + 20 = 762\n\nSince 762 > 223 (my outside offer), this initial offer is worth considering.\n\nNow, let's consider a slightly more aggressive offer, giving less to Player 2 to see how the negotiation progresses.\n\nOffer:\nItem 1: 1 unit\nItem 2: 3 units\nItem 3: 2 units\nItem 4: 2 unit\nItem 5: 5 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 3 units (3 * 96 = 288)\nItem 2: 4 units (4 * 79 = 316)\nItem 3: 2 units (2 * 33 = 66)\nItem 4: 3 units (3 * 56 = 168)\nItem 5: 4 units (4 * 5 = 20)\n\nTotal value for me: 288 + 316 + 66 + 168 + 20 = 858\n\nThis is better than the previous one.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 6, 3, 5, 9] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 4 + 41 x 6 + 74 x 3 + 51 x 5 + 100 x 9\n    which is 2003 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 2007. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 2, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 2, 2, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

So the offer should be such that Player 1 gets at least 111.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 2, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1.\n\n*   Value if I offer [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]:\n    *   Item 1: 4 units, value = 4 * 95 = 380\n    *   Item 2: 5 units, value = 5 * 41 = 205\n    *   Item 3: 3 units, value = 3 * 74 = 222\n    *   Item 4: 4 units, value = 4 * 51 = 204\n    *   Item 5: 9 units, value = 9 * 100 = 900\n    *   Total Value: 380 + 205 + 222 + 204 + 900 = 1911\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer. So the next thing to do is to try offering something a bit less.\n\nLet's offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].\n* Value if I offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\n    *   Item 1: 4 units, value = 4 * 95 = 380\n    *   Item 2: 6 units, value = 6 * 41 = 246\n    *   Item 3: 4 units, value = 4 * 74 = 296\n    *   Item 4: 5 units, value = 5 * 51 = 255\n    *   Item 5: 9 units, value = 9 * 100 = 900\n    *   Total Value: 380 + 246 + 296 + 255 + 900 = 2077\n\nThis is bigger than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, and I can make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 2, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 2 is currently offering me [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy values for each item are 96, 79, 33, 56, and 5, respectively. Therefore, the value of the current offer to me is:\n\n(0 * 96) + (1 * 79) + (0 * 33) + (0 * 56) + (0 * 5) = 79\n\nConsidering the discount factor of 0.9, the present value of accepting this offer is 79 * (0.9)^(2-1) = 79 * 0.9 = 71.1\n\nMy outside offer is worth 223. Since 71.1 < 223, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. In round 1, I offered Player 2 [1, 3, 2, 2, 5]. They countered with [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]. This suggests they value item 2 highly and perhaps not other items. I need to offer them something that is attractive to them while retaining enough value for myself to exceed my outside offer (discounted). Let's try offering them slightly more than my initial offer from round 1 and see if it leaves me with enough value. I'll increase my item 2 offering slightly.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [1, 4, 2, 2, 5].\nThis means I keep 4-1=3 of item 1, 7-4=3 of item 2, 4-2=2 of item 3, 5-2=3 of item 4 and 9-5=4 of item 5. My value then is\n(3 * 96) + (3 * 79) + (2 * 33) + (3 * 56) + (4 * 5) = 288 + 237 + 66 + 168 + 20 = 779.\n\nWith the discount factor, this is 779 * 0.9 = 701.1 > 223, which is much greater than my outside option.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 6, 3, 5, 9] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 4 + 41 x 6 + 74 x 3 + 51 x 5 + 100 x 9\n    which is 2003 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 2007. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 2, 5]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 2, 2, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 2, 2, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 2007\n*   Item values: item 1 = 95, item 2 = 41, item 3 = 74, item 4 = 51, item 5 = 100\n*   Total items: 4 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 9 units of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value to me, and an offer accepted this round (round 2) is worth 0.9 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 4, 2, 2, 5]. This means I keep 4-1=3 units of item 1, 7-4=3 units of item 2, 4-2=2 units of item 3, 5-2=3 units of item 4, and 9-5=4 units of item 5. The value to me is:\n    *   3 * 95 + 3 * 41 + 2 * 74 + 3 * 51 + 4 * 100 = 285 + 123 + 148 + 153 + 400 = 1109\n    *   Adjusted for the discount factor: 1109 * 0.9 = 998.1\n\n    *   **Comparison to outside offer:** 998.1 < 2007, so accepting this offer is currently worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make an offer that is better than 2007/0.9 = 2230 in value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is not good. I need to formulate a counteroffer. To avoid mistake 2, my counteroffer needs to leave me with a total value greater than my outside offer when discounted.\n\nLet's aim for a value close to my outside offer in the next round.\nI will give the other player 0 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 0 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 0 unit of item 5.\nThis leaves me with 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 unit of item 3, 5 unit of item 4, and 9 unit of item 5.\nThis value is 4*95 + 1*41 + 4*74 + 5*51 + 9*100 = 380 + 41 + 296 + 255 + 900 = 1872.\n\nLet's try to offer [0, 2, 0, 0, 0].

This leaves me with: 4*95 + 5*41 + 4*74 + 5*51 + 9*100 = 2036.\nValue of 2036*0.9 is 1832.4 which is worse than my outside offer.\n\nI will propose a counteroffer of [1, 3, 2, 2, 5]. This leaves me with a value of (3*95 + 4*41 + 2*74 + 3*51 + 4*100) * 0.9 = (285+164+148+153+400)*0.9 = 1150 * 0.9 = 1035. This is bad too.\n\nIf I accept, 1109 * 0.9 = 998.1.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's start by outlining my strategy. I want to maximize my outcome, considering my private values and outside offer. Since it's round 1, I'll begin by making a counteroffer that gives Player 2 a decent amount while still securing a good value for myself. I will consider Player 2 needs to get at least their outside offer value to accept, which I do not know yet.\n\nMy values are: item 1: 63, item 2: 43, item 3: 76, item 4: 21, item 5: 99.\nTotal items: item 1: 5, item 2: 6, item 3: 2, item 4: 5, item 5: 3.\nMy outside offer: 820\n\nI'll aim for a split that gives me significantly more value than my outside offer, in case Player 2 has a low outside offer. Let's start by offering Player 2 half of items 1, 2, 4 and half of items 3, 5 or less, since there are a small number of those.\n\nOffer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 1\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 1\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 3 * 63 = 189\n- Item 2: 3 * 43 = 129\n- Item 3: 1 * 76 = 76\n- Item 4: 3 * 21 = 63\n- Item 5: 2 * 99 = 198\nTotal value for me: 189 + 129 + 76 + 63 + 198 = 655. This is much less than my outside offer, I need to rework this.\n\nLet's try offering less of the valuable items 3 and 5.\nOffer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 3\n- Item 3: 0\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 0\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 1: 3 * 63 = 189\n- Item 2: 3 * 43 = 129\n- Item 3: 2 * 76 = 152\n- Item 4: 3 * 21 = 63\n- Item 5: 3 * 99 = 297\nTotal value for me: 189 + 129 + 152 + 63 + 297 = 830.\nThis is just above my outside offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 57 x 0 + 97 x 1 + 58 x 1 + 10 x 0\n    which is 155 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 161. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 3, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 4 + 57 x 3 + 98 x 3 + 22 x 0 + 24 x 2\n    which is 845 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 846. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value is 846.\n    *   My values for the items are: item 1 = 83, item 2 = 57, item 3 = 98, item 4 = 22, item 5 = 24.\n    *   The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n    *   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that getting a deal later is worth less than getting it now. If I wait until round 2, the value will be multiplied by 0.9. If I wait until round 3, it will be multiplied by 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This means I get 1 unit of item 1. My value for this offer is 1 * 83 = 83.\n    *   This is significantly less than my outside offer of 846, therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n    *   If I walk away I get 846.\n    *   I need to propose a counteroffer.\n\n    Let's explore some potential counteroffers: I need to keep enough items such that the total value is greater than 846.\n\n    *   Offer 1: I keep [5, 4, 4, 2, 2] and give [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. Value = 5 * 83 + 4 * 57 + 4 * 98 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 24 = 415 + 228 + 392 + 44 + 48 = 1127. This offer gives me 1127, which is more than my outside offer. I'll use this as a starting point.\n    *   Offer 2: I keep [4, 4, 4, 2, 2] and give [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. Value = 4 * 83 + 4 * 57 + 4 * 98 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 24 = 332 + 228 + 392 + 44 + 48 = 1044.\n    *   Offer 3: I keep [3, 4, 4, 2, 2] and give [3, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. Value = 3 * 83 + 4 * 57 + 4 * 98 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 24 = 249 + 228 + 392 + 44 + 48 = 961.\n    *   Offer 4: I keep [2, 4, 4, 2, 2] and give [4, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. Value = 2 * 83 + 4 * 57 + 4 * 98 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 24 = 166 + 228 + 392 + 44 + 48 = 878.\n    *   Offer 5: I keep [1, 4, 4, 2, 2] and give [5, 0, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. Value = 1 * 83 + 4 * 57 + 4 * 98 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 24 = 83 + 228 + 392 + 44 + 48 = 795. This is worse than my outside offer.\n\n    Let's try to find a valid offer which is better than the outside offer:\n    *   Offer 6: I keep [2, 3, 4, 2, 2] and give [4, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. Value = 2 * 83 + 3 * 57 + 4 * 98 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 24 = 166 + 171 + 392 + 44 + 48 = 821. This is worse than my outside offer.\n    *   Offer 7: I keep [3, 3, 4, 2, 2] and give [3, 1, 0, 0, 0] to player 1. Value = 3 * 83 + 3 * 57 + 4 * 98 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 24 = 249 + 171 + 392 + 44 + 48 = 904.\n    *   Offer 8: I keep [2, 4, 3, 2, 2] and give [4, 0, 1, 0, 0] to player 1. Value = 2 * 83 + 4 * 57 + 3 * 98 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 24 = 166 + 228 + 294 + 44 + 48 = 780. This is worse than my outside offer.\n    *   Offer 9: I keep [3, 4, 3, 2, 2] and give [3, 0, 1, 0, 0] to player 1. Value = 3 * 83 + 4 * 57 + 3 * 98 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 24 = 249 + 228 + 294 + 44 + 48 = 863.\n    *   Offer 10: I keep [4, 4, 2, 2, 2] and give [2, 0, 2, 0, 0] to player 1. Value = 4 * 83 + 4 * 57 + 2 * 98 + 2 * 22 + 2 * 24 = 332 + 228 + 196 + 44 + 48 = 848. This is better than my outside offer.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer is terrible.\n    *   Walking away gets me 846.\n    *   Offer 10 would give me 848, which is greater than my outside offer and gives Player 1 two item 1s and two item 3s.\n    *   I'll make counteroffer 10.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My value would be 0 * 83 + 0 * 57 + 0 * 98 + 1 * 22 + 0 * 24 = 22. This is much lower than my outside offer of 846.\n    *   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 846. I have:\n        *   6 units of item 1 (value 83 each)\n        *   4 units of item 2 (value 57 each)\n        *   4 units of item 3 (value 98 each)\n        *   2 units of item 4 (value 22 each)\n        *   2 units of item 5 (value 24 each)\n        Let's say I keep all the items for myself. That would be 6*83 + 4*57 + 4*98 + 2*22 + 2*24 = 498 + 228 + 392 + 44 + 48 = 1210. This is much higher than my outside offer.\n\n    *   **Compare to Outside Offer:** I need to make sure any offer I accept or any counteroffer I make results in a value greater than 846.\n\n3.  **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   The current offer is terrible (value 22). I should not accept.\n    *   Walking away gives me 846.\n    *   I want to make a counteroffer that is better than 846 and might be accepted by Player 1.\n\nLet's try to construct a good counteroffer. I should consider offering the other player things that I value less and keeping the items I value more. I really value item 3 and item 1, so let's keep most of those.\n\nCounteroffer: Let's offer the other player 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. This means I keep:\n* 5 units of item 1 = 5 * 83 = 415\n* 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 57 = 114\n* 4 units of item 3 = 4 * 98 = 392\n* 1 unit of item 4 = 1 * 22 = 22\n* 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 24 = 24\nTotal Value = 415 + 114 + 392 + 22 + 24 = 967. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 1 and the other agent is Player 2.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 2 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 63 for item 1, 93 for item 2, 97 for item 3, 37 for item 4, 65 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1342. Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1145. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1145. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1065 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 3, the final round. The current offer on the table gives me:\n\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   2 units of item 2\n*   0 units of item 3\n*   1 unit of item 4\n*   1 unit of item 5\n\nMy private values are:\n\n*   Item 1: 63\n*   Item 2: 93\n*   Item 3: 97\n*   Item 4: 37\n*   Item 5: 65\n\nSo, the value of the current offer to me is:\n\n(1 * 63) + (2 * 93) + (0 * 97) + (1 * 37) + (1 * 65) = 63 + 186 + 0 + 37 + 65 = 351\n\nSince it is the last round, the discount factor doesn't matter, so the value is simply 351. My outside offer is 1145. Since 351 < 1145, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away and taking my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my best course of action is to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
