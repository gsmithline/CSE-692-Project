This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 64 x 1 + 25 x 2 + 34 x 1\n    which is 148 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 149. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer carefully and determine my best action.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n- My outside offer value: 149\n- My item values: 86 for item 1, 64 for item 2, 64 for item 3, 25 for item 4, 34 for item 5\n- Total pool: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- Current round: 1 (discount factor doesn't apply yet)\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of the current offer\nThe current offer gives me:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n- 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 64 = 256\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n\nTotal value of this offer to me: 86 + 256 + 192 + 25 + 34 = 593\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 149.\n\n### Step 3: Consider potential counteroffers\nLooking at my values, I should prioritize:\n- Item 1 (highest value at 86 per unit)\n- Items 2 and 3 (both at 64 per unit)\n- Item 5 (34 per unit)\n- Item 4 (lowest value at 25 per unit)\n\nLet me construct a counteroffer where I keep most of the high-value items and offer more of the low-value items:\n\nIf I offer [1, 2, 1, 4, 3], I would keep:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n\nTotal value for me: 258 + 192 + 192 + 25 + 34 = 701\n\nThis counteroffer would be worth 701 to me, which is better than both the current offer (593) and my outside offer (149).\n\n### Step 4: Decision making\nPlayer 1's offer gives me substantial value (593), indicating they might not value items 2 and 3 as highly as I do. They're offering me 4 of 5 units of item 2 and 3 of 4 units of item 3.\n\nMy counteroffer aims to maximize my value while still being potentially acceptable to Player 1. I'm giving them more of items 4 and 5 which I value less, while keeping more of the items I value highly.\n\nSince we're only in round 1, making a counteroffer is appropriate. If negotiations continue, the discount factor will reduce overall value in later rounds.\n\n### Final decision:\nI'll make a counteroffer that gives me higher value while accommodating what appear to be Player 1's preferences.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 4, 3]}",

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 64 x 1 + 25 x 2 + 34 x 1\n    which is 148 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 149. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 3, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 4, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer carefully to determine the best action. Let's go through this step by step.\n\n1) Current situation analysis:\n   - My outside offer value: 149\n   - My values per item: Item 1 (86), Item 2 (64), Item 3 (64), Item 4 (25), Item 5 (34)\n   - Total pool: 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - We're in round 2, so discount factor (0.9) is applied once if I accept now: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) Assess the current offer from Player 1:\n   Player 1 is offering me [2, 3, 2, 2, 1] which means I would get:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n   - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n   Total value = 576\n\n   With round 2 discount: 576 \u00d7 0.9 = 518.4\n\n   This is significantly better than my outside offer of 149.\n\n3) Considering a potential counteroffer:\n   From Player 1's offers, they seem to value item 1 and item 5 more than the others (they're offering me less of these). Let me consider what I might counteroffer.\n\n   If I offer Player 1 [1, 2, 1, 3, 2], I would keep [3, 3, 3, 2, 2] for myself:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 34 = 68\n   Total value = 760\n\n   If negotiation continues to round 3, this would be discounted to: 760 \u00d7 0.81 = 615.6\n\n   However, making a counteroffer risks Player 1 walking away, or further negotiation that results in a worse outcome due to the discount factor.\n\n4) Decision analysis:\n   - The current offer gives me 518.4 (with discount), which is much better than my outside offer of 149\n   - A counteroffer might get me more, but carries risk and will be subject to further discount\n   - This is the final round of negotiation, so if I make a counteroffer and Player 1 rejects it, we both get our outside offers\n   - Player 1's offer has improved from round 1, suggesting they're willing to negotiate\n\nGiven that the current offer is substantially better than my outside offer and we're already in round 2 (with more discounting to come), and considering that a counteroffer risks walking away with just my outside offer, I will accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 0 + 51 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 76 x 5 + 23 x 3\n    which is 449 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 450. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 23 x 1 + 30 x 3 + 21 x 5 + 4 x 1\n    which is 222 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 223. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 4, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 4, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation carefully to make the best decision.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 223\n- My item values:\n  - Item 1: 97 per unit (total: 3 units)\n  - Item 2: 23 per unit (total: 2 units)\n  - Item 3: 30 per unit (total: 4 units)\n  - Item 4: 21 per unit (total: 7 units)\n  - Item 5: 4 per unit (total: 3 units)\n- Total items: 3 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 3 = 19 items\n- Discount factor: 0.9 (which means each round reduces value by 10%)\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of the current offer\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 4, 2]. This means I would receive:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 21 = 84\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nTotal value of the offer to me: 97 + 23 + 60 + 84 + 8 = 272\n\nSince this is round 1, there's no discount applied yet. The value 272 is greater than my outside offer of 223, so this offer is actually better than walking away.\n\n### Step 3: Consider potential counteroffers\n\nI want to maximize my value while making an offer that Player 1 might accept. Based on Player 1's initial offer, they seem to value item 1 (giving me only 1 of 3 units), item 2 (giving me only 1 of 2 units), and item 5 (giving me 2 of 3 units) relatively highly. They seem less interested in item 3 (giving me half) and item 4 (giving me more than half).\n\nLet me consider a counteroffer where I prioritize the highest-value items for myself:\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [1, 0, 2, 5, 2], I would keep:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 23 = 46\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n\nTotal value to me: 194 + 46 + 60 + 42 + 4 = 346\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 223 and better than Player 1's current offer to me (272).\n\n### Decision\n\nThe counteroffer [1, 0, 2, 5, 2] gives me a value of 346, which is:\n- Better than my outside offer (223)\n- Better than accepting Player 1's current offer (272)\n- Likely acceptable to Player 1 as I'm giving them the majority of items they seemed to value in their initial offer (especially item 4, which I value less)\n\nTherefore, I'll propose this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 5, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 223. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 525 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 23 x 1 + 30 x 3 + 21 x 5 + 4 x 1\n    which is 222 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 223. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 5, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 4, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 4, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 82 x 1 + 92 x 0 + 64 x 3 + 81 x 0\n    which is 274 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 276. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### 1) Current Situation Analysis\n- My outside offer value: 1029\n- My private values: 90 for item 1, 38 for item 2, 94 for item 3, 26 for item 4, 57 for item 5\n- Total pool of items: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.9, meaning offers in future rounds will be worth less\n- Current round: 1, so no discount applied yet\n\n### 2) Assess Value of Current Offer\nPlayer 1 is offering me [3, 0, 0, 3, 2] out of [4, 1, 6, 4, 6]\nThat means I would receive:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 38 = 0\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 94 = 0\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 57 = 114\nTotal value of this offer to me: 462\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 1029, so I should not accept it.\n\n### 3) Consider Potential Counteroffers\nLet me consider what I should keep vs. offer to Player 1:\n\nItem 1 (90 value): These are high value to me, so I should keep most\nItem 2 (38 value): Moderate value, but there's only 1 unit\nItem 3 (94 value): Highest value per unit, I should keep most of these\nItem 4 (26 value): Lowest value, I can offer most of these\nItem 5 (57 value): Moderate value, I can be more flexible\n\nGiven Player 1's initial offer, they seem to value item 1 and item 4, but offered me none of item 2, 3, and most of item 5. This suggests they might value items 2 and 3 highly.\n\nLet me formulate a counteroffer that keeps my high-value items and offers more of my low-value items:\n\nIf I keep:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n- 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 94 = 470\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 57 = 228\nTotal value: 1032\n\nThis means I'd offer Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nThis counteroffer gives me 1032 value, which is slightly better than my outside offer of 1029, and might be acceptable to Player 1 as it gives them more of item 4 which they seem to value.\n\n### 4) Decision\nThe current offer on the table (462) is much less than my outside offer (1029).\nMy proposed counteroffer gives me a value of 1032, which exceeds my outside offer.\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 3, 2]}",

Since item 3 is very valuable to me (84 per unit), I want to keep as much of it as possible. Item 1 and 4 are of low value to me, so I can offer more of those.\n\nMy previous offer was [3, 0, 0, 3, 2], and Player 2 countered with [1, 0, 1, 3, 2]. Player 2 seems to want at least 1 unit of item 3, and is willing to give me most of item 1. \n\nLet me propose a new offer that gives them 1 unit of item 3 (as they requested) but adjusts other items slightly in my favor:\n[2, 0, 1, 3, 3]\n\nThis would leave me with [2, 1, 5, 1, 3], worth: (2 \u00d7 2) + (1 \u00d7 26) + (5 \u00d7 84) + (1 \u00d7 9) + (3 \u00d7 29) = 4 + 26 + 420 + 9 + 87 = 546\nWith discount: 546 \u00d7 0.9 = 491.4\n\nThis is still much better than my outside offer of 340. Player 2 gets one more unit of item 5 compared to their current offer, which might make it attractive to them.\n\nActually, after reconsidering, the current offer is already quite good for me. If I make a new counteroffer, we'll go to round 3 and face further discounting. The present value of the current offer (519.3) is significantly better than my outside option (340), so I should accept.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    65 x 1 + 28 x 0 + 16 x 3 + 8 x 4 + 47 x 4\n    which is 333 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 334. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 3, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 3 + 57 x 1 + 38 x 3 + 77 x 5 + 7 x 1\n    which is 773 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 777. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 777. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 747 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 3, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    70 x 3 + 57 x 1 + 38 x 3 + 77 x 5 + 7 x 1\n    which is 773 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 777. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 3, 2, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 3 + 87 x 2 + 81 x 3 + 71 x 2 + 60 x 7\n    which is 1090 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1091. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let me try one more:\n   \n   If I keep [3, 2, 3, 2, 7] and offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n   - 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 60 = 420\n   Total value = 1090\n   \n   This is still just short of my outside offer. One more unit of item 5 would put me over:\n   \n   If I keep [3, 2, 3, 2, 8] and offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:\n   - Total value = 1090 + 60 = 1150\n   \n   But offering nothing is a mistake (Mistake 3). Instead, I need to make a reasonable offer that still keeps my value above my outside offer.\n\n4) **Decision:**\n   Looking at Player 1's offer, they seem to value items 2 and 4 more (they kept all of them), and value items 1, 3, and 5 less. So I should offer them more of items 1, 3, and 5.\n   \n   Let me try: Keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 7] and offer [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n   - 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 60 = 420\n   Total value = 972\n   \n   This is still below my outside offer. I need to keep more value.\n\n   Let me try: Keep [3, 2, 2, 2, 7] and offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n   - 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 60 = 420\n   Total value = 1009\n   \n   This is still below my outside offer.\n\n   Let me try: Keep [3, 2, 3, 2, 6] and offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 87 = 174\n   - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n   - 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 60 = 360\n   Total value = 1030\n   \n   This is still below my outside offer. \n\n   Given the high outside offer and my item values, it seems I need to keep almost everything to exceed my outside offer value. Since this is only round 1, I'll make a somewhat aggressive counteroffer while still giving Player 1 something:\n\n   Keep [3, 2, 3, 2, 7] and offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]:\n   - Total value to me = 1090\n   \n   This is still just below my outside offer (1091), but it's the closest I can get while making a non-zero offer. Since it's only round 1 and values will be discounted in later rounds, I think this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 3, 2, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 3 + 87 x 2 + 81 x 3 + 71 x 2 + 60 x 7\n    which is 1090 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1091. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 236. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 236. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 618 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 0 + 20 x 5 + 32 x 3 + 39 x 1 + 20 x 0\n    which is 235 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 236. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 171. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 516 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 3, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 2 + 71 x 0 + 42 x 3 + 17 x 1 + 29 x 0\n    which is 169 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 171. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

My highest value item is item 2 (71), followed by item 3 (42).\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer where I keep most of items 2 and 3, and give Player 1 most of the other items:\n\nIf I offer Player 1: [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nThen I would keep: [1, 3, 4, 1, 1]\n\nValue to me:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 42 = 168\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n\nTotal value to me: 13 + 213 + 168 + 17 + 29 = 440\n\nThis is significantly higher than my outside offer of 171, so this looks like a good counteroffer.\n\n## Decision\n\nSince the current offer (155) is less than my outside offer (171), I should not accept.\nMy counteroffer would give me a value of 440, which is much better than my outside offer.\nI'll make a counteroffer that keeps most of my high-value items while still giving Player 1 a reasonable share.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}",

If I make a counteroffer, we'll go to round 3, and the discount factor will increase to 0.9\u00b2. Any deal would be worth only 0.81 of its original value.\n\n## 4) Decision\n\nLooking at my options:\n1. Accept current offer: Value of 347.4 (much better than outside offer of 171)\n2. Make counteroffer: Would lead to round 3 with additional discount, and Player 1 might reject or counter again\n3. Walk away: Get outside offer of 171 (worse than accepting current offer)\n\nThe current offer is quite good for me, giving me most of the highly valuable item 3 and all of items 4 and 5. While I could try to get a slightly better deal in round 3, the additional discount makes this risky.\n\nI'll accept the current offer to secure a good value that's well above my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 7, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    71 x 2 + 89 x 1 + 33 x 7 + 53 x 2 + 7 x 3\n    which is 589 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 590. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "I need to analyze the current situation and make a decision that maximizes my value while considering my outside offer.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 590\n- My item values: 71 for item 1, 89 for item 2, 33 for item 3, 53 for item 4, 7 for item 5\n- Total pool of items: 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 8 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.9 (in round 2, so discount will be 0.9\u00b9 = 0.9)\n\n## Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\nLet's evaluate the current offer from Player 1:\n- I would receive: [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]\n- My value for this offer:\n  1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n  1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n  2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 33 = 66\n  2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n  4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n  Total value = 360\n\nWith the discount factor applied: 360 \u00d7 0.9 = 324\n\nMy outside offer (590) is significantly better than accepting this offer (324).\n\n## Step 3: Consider a counteroffer\n\nLooking at my values, I should prioritize keeping:\n- Item 2 (89 per unit)\n- Item 1 (71 per unit)\n- Item 4 (53 per unit)\n- Item 3 (33 per unit)\n- Item 5 (7 per unit)\n\nLet's try this distribution:\n- I keep: [4, 2, 6, 1, 0]\n- Player 1 gets: [1, 0, 2, 1, 4]\n\nMy value would be:\n4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 71 = 284\n2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 33 = 198\n1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\nTotal value = 713\n\nWith discount factor applied: 713 \u00d7 0.9 = 641.7\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 590.\n\nLet me check if this is a reasonable offer. Player 1 previously offered me [1, 1, 2, 2, 4], which suggests they might value item 5 less (since they're giving all units). They also seem to value item 3 since they're only offering 2 of 8 units.\n\nLet me refine my counteroffer to be a bit more generous, since we're in round 2 and need to reach an agreement:\n- I keep: [3, 2, 5, 1, 0]\n- Player 1 gets: [2, 0, 3, 1, 4]\n\nMy value would be:\n3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 33 = 165\n1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\nTotal value = 609\n\nWith discount factor applied: 609 \u00d7 0.9 = 548.1\n\nThis is still below my outside offer. Let me adjust one more time:\n- I keep: [3, 2, 6, 1, 0]\n- Player 1 gets: [2, 0, 2, 1, 4]\n\nMy value would be:\n3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 33 = 198\n1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\nTotal value = 642\n\nWith discount factor applied: 642 \u00d7 0.9 = 577.8\n\nThis is still slightly below my outside offer.\n\nLet's try once more:\n- I keep: [4, 2, 5, 1, 0]\n- Player 1 gets: [1, 0, 3, 1, 4]\n\nMy value would be:\n4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 71 = 284\n2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 33 = 165\n1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\nTotal value = 680\n\nWith discount factor applied: 680 \u00d7 0.9 = 612\n\nThis is better than my outside offer (590).\n\n## Decision\n\nBased on my analysis:\n1. The current offer from Player 1 is worth 324 (with discount), which is worse than my outside offer of 590.\n2. I can propose a counteroffer that gives me a value of 612 (with discount), which is better than my outside offer.\n3. This counteroffer gives Player 1 [1, 0, 3, 1, 4], which keeps the distribution of item 5 (which they seem to value less) the same.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 1, 4]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 13 x 5 + 36 x 0\n    which is 65 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 67. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since Player 1 seems less interested in item 4, I can offer more of it.\n\nLet me try a counteroffer where I give:\n- 3 units of item 1 (keeping 3)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keeping 1)\n- 3 units of item 3 (keeping 3)\n- 4 units of item 4 (keeping 1)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 1)\n\nMy value if this is accepted:\n- 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (item 1)\n- 1 \u00d7 43 = 43 (item 2)  \n- 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (item 3)\n- 1 \u00d7 13 = 13 (item 4)\n- 1 \u00d7 36 = 36 (item 5)\nTotal = 404\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer and better than accepting the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 3, 4, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    63 x 0 + 43 x 0 + 41 x 0 + 13 x 5 + 36 x 0\n    which is 65 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 67. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 3, 4, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze the current offer, determine its value to me, and make the best decision to maximize my payoff.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis\n\n- My outside offer value: 67\n- My item values: \n  - Item 1: 63 per unit\n  - Item 2: 43 per unit\n  - Item 3: 41 per unit\n  - Item 4: 13 per unit\n  - Item 5: 36 per unit\n- Total pool: 6 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n- We're in round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n## 2) Evaluating Current Offer\n\nPlayer 1 is offering me: [5, 0, 4, 2, 1] (keeping [1, 1, 2, 3, 1] for themselves)\n\nValue of this offer to me:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 63 = 315\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 41 = 164\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 36 = 36\n\nTotal value: 541 \u00d7 0.9 (discount factor) = 486.9\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 67.\n\n## 3) Considering a Counteroffer\n\nBased on Player 1's offers:\n- They initially offered me [5, 0, 4, 2, 2] (keeping [1, 1, 2, 3, 0])\n- Now they're offering [5, 0, 4, 2, 1] (keeping [1, 1, 2, 3, 1])\n\nThis suggests they might value item 5 more than previously indicated. Let me consider a counteroffer that keeps my high-value items while giving them what they seem to value:\n\nI'll keep: [5, 0, 4, 1, 1] (giving them [1, 1, 2, 4, 1])\n\nValue of this potential counteroffer to me:\n- 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 63 = 315\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 43 = 0\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 41 = 164\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 13 = 13\n- 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 36 = 36\n\nTotal value: 528 \u00d7 0.9 (round 2 discount) = 475.2\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer, but slightly worse than accepting their current offer.\n\n## 4) Decision\n\nSince this is round 2 of 3, and the current offer is quite beneficial to me (486.9, compared to my outside offer of 67), I should accept it. Making a counteroffer risks getting a worse deal in round 3 with further discounting.\n\nThe current offer gives me most of the high-value item 1 (which I value at 63 per unit) and a good portion of item 3 (which I value at 41 per unit).\n\nTherefore, I'll accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 2 + 98 x 0 + 17 x 1 + 12 x 2 + 7 x 0\n    which is 93 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 94. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer carefully and decide on my next move. Let me break this down step by step:\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 94\n   - My item values are: \n     * Item 1: 26 per unit (3 total units)\n     * Item 2: 98 per unit (3 total units)\n     * Item 3: 17 per unit (5 total units)\n     * Item 4: 12 per unit (4 total units)\n     * Item 5: 7 per unit (1 total unit)\n   - Total pool: 3 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 1 of item 5\n   - This is round 1, so discount factor doesn't apply yet\n\n2) Assessing the value of the current offer:\n   Player 1 offered me [0, 1, 1, 3, 0], meaning I would receive:\n   - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 98 = 98\n   - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n   - 0 unit of item 5: 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n   Total value to me = 151\n\n   This is greater than my outside offer of 94, so accepting would be better than walking away.\n\n3) Evaluating potential counteroffers:\n   Given my values, item 2 is by far the most valuable to me at 98 per unit. Player 1's offer only gives me 1 unit of item 2, suggesting they might value it as well.\n   \n   Let me propose a counteroffer where I keep more of item 2 and offer items that seem less valuable to me:\n   If I offer Player 1 [2, 0, 3, 3, 1], I would keep:\n   - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 17 = 34\n   - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n   Total value to me = 366\n\n   This is significantly better than my outside offer (94) and the current offer (151).\n\nThe counteroffer I'm proposing gives me items that I value highly (especially item 2) while offering Player 1 a reasonable share of the other items. My counteroffer value of 366 is much better than both my outside offer (94) and the current offer (151), so it makes sense to proceed with this.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 3, 3, 1]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 82 x 2 + 28 x 2 + 10 x 4 + 62 x 3\n    which is 446 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 449. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 803. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 803. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1161 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 0 + 96 x 4 + 98 x 1 + 20 x 1 + 100 x 3\n    which is 802 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 803. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 0, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 3 + 54 x 0 + 83 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 35 x 4\n    which is 401 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 402. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [5, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 3, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 1 + 93 x 5 + 53 x 3 + 19 x 0 + 83 x 3\n    which is 915 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 918. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 461. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 461. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 852 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 4, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 2 + 59 x 0 + 53 x 4 + 35 x 2 + 50 x 0\n    which is 456 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 461. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Let me try to improve this.\n\nLet me adjust to:\n- Keep all 4 units of item 1 (high value to me at 87 per unit)\n- Keep 1 unit of item 3 (some value at 53 per unit)\n- Keep 1 unit of item 4 (lower value to me at 35 per unit)\n- Keep 2 units of item 5 (medium value to me at 50 per unit)\n\nSo I'd offer Player 1: [0, 0, 3, 2, 0]\n\nMy value calculation:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 59 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n\nTotal value = 348 + 0 + 53 + 35 + 100 = 536\n\nWith discount factor: 536 \u00d7 0.9 = 482.4\n\nThis value (482.4) exceeds my outside offer (461), so this would be a good deal for me.\n\n## Decision\n\nSince this counteroffer is better than my outside offer, and considering we're already in round 2 (with only 1 round remaining), I will make this counteroffer. The value I'd get (482.4) is better than my outside offer (461).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 2, 0]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 1 + 56 x 2 + 9 x 1 + 71 x 0 + 96 x 2\n    which is 316 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 318. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's calculate my value:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 56 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n- Total value = 454\n\nThis is better than my outside offer of 318.\n\n### Analysis of Player 1's offer:\nPlayer 1 is keeping [2, 0, 2, 2, 3] and offering me [0, 2, 0, 4, 0]. This suggests:\n- They value items 1, 3, and 5 highly\n- They don't value item 2 much\n- They have moderate value for item 4 (offering me 4 out of 6)\n\n## Step 3: Make a decision\n\nThe current offer gives me a value of 454, which is significantly better than my outside offer of 318. However, I should try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.\n\nMy highest-value items are item 5 (96 per unit) and item 4 (71 per unit). I should try to keep all of item 5 and most of item 4, and I can give up more of items 1 and 3 which have low value to me.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I keep all of item 5, most of item 4, all of item 2, and give up most of items 1 and 3:\n\nMy counteroffer (what I give to Player 1): [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]\nThis means I keep: [0, 2, 0, 4, 3]\n\nLet's calculate my value with this division:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 3 = 0\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 9 = 0\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 71 = 284\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n- Total value = 684\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a value of 684, which is much better than both my outside offer (318) and Player 1's current offer (454). It also aligns with what I believe are Player 1's preferences based on their initial offer, so it has a good chance of being accepted.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 1 + 56 x 2 + 9 x 1 + 71 x 0 + 96 x 2\n    which is 316 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 318. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
