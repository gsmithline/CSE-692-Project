By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 8, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    85 x 0 + 89 x 3 + 29 x 8 + 100 x 2 + 43 x 2\n    which is 785 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 786. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\nThe present value of the offer is 499 * 0.9 = 449.1\n\nMy outside offer value is 446. Since 449.1 > 446, this offer is better than walking away right now.\n\nHowever, let's consider if I can make a better counteroffer for myself. Since this is round 2, if my counteroffer is rejected, I can walk away in round 3 and get my outside offer of 446 (discounted by 0.9^2 = 0.81, which would be approximately 361.26).\n\nLet's see what I had offered in the previous round: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\nPlayer 2 countered with [1, 1, 4, 1, 1]. I suspect that player 2 values item 3 highly. I have 9 units of item 3 to work with. I'm getting 4 currently.\n\nI'm going to try to improve my overall return by proposing a counteroffer where I keep slightly more of the other items and give a little less of item 3. The total quantities are: 6 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 9 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. I'll try the offer [1, 1, 3, 1, 1].\n\nIf player 2 accepts, that is:\n1 unit of item 1: 1 * 23 = 23\n1 unit of item 2: 1 * 41 = 41\n3 units of item 3: 3 * 83 = 249\n1 unit of item 4: 1 * 23 = 23\n1 unit of item 5: 1 * 80 = 80\nTotal value of the offer = 23 + 41 + 249 + 23 + 80 = 416.  Discounted, 416 * 0.9 = 374.4\n\nThis counteroffer value is way worse than my current offer. Thus I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action for Player 1 in round 1.\n\n**Understanding the Game:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Maximize my discounted value from the negotiation, taking into account my outside offer.\n*   **Information:** I know my own values for each item and my outside offer. I don't know Player 2's values or outside offer.\n*   **Strategy:** I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Player 2 to accept, but also maximizes my own value. I need to consider the discount factor in future rounds.\n*   **Risk:** If I make an unreasonable offer, Player 2 might walk away, or the negotiation might continue to later rounds, reducing my potential value due to the discount factor.\n*   **Round 1 Advantage:** I am making the first offer.\n\n**Calculating My Total Value:**\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units * 70 = 140\n*   Item 2: 2 units * 48 = 96\n*   Item 3: 3 units * 28 = 84\n*   Item 4: 4 units * 68 = 272\n*   Item 5: 4 units * 31 = 124\n*   Total Value = 140 + 96 + 84 + 272 + 124 = 716\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince I am the first player, and have the option to set the starting point for negotiation, I should propose an offer that is slightly advantageous for Player 2, while also securing a good outcome for myself. I don't know what Player 2's valuations are, so it is hard to know what they deem acceptable. A simple starting point is to divide the goods evenly and offer those amounts to player 2. The offer would be:\n*Item 1: 1 unit\n*Item 2: 1 unit\n*Item 3: 1.5 units\n*Item 4: 2 units\n*Item 5: 2 units\n\nGiven player 2 might be willing to accept something slightly worse than an even split (and the offer has to be integers), let's slightly skew it to my advantage. I will offer:\n*Item 1: 1 unit\n*Item 2: 1 unit\n*Item 3: 1 unit\n*Item 4: 2 unit\n*Item 5: 2 unit\n\nThe value of this to Player 2 will be:\nItem 1: 1 * v1\\_2\nItem 2: 1 * v2\\_2\nItem 3: 1 * v3\\_2\nItem 4: 2 * v4\\_2\nItem 5: 2 * v5\\_2\n\nMy value from this is:\nItem 1: 1 * 70 = 70\nItem 2: 1 * 48 = 48\nItem 3: 2 * 28 = 56\nItem 4: 2 * 68 = 136\nItem 5: 2 * 31 = 62\nTotal: 70 + 48 + 56 + 136 + 62 = 372\n\nSince 372 < 624, I will need to propose an offer that is higher. \nLet's try offering:\n*Item 1: 1 unit\n*Item 2: 1 unit\n*Item 3: 1.5 units\n*Item 4: 2 units\n*Item 5: 2 units\nSince this is impossible, let's try offering\n*Item 1: 1 unit\n*Item 2: 1 unit\n*Item 3: 2 units\n*Item 4: 2 unit\n*Item 5: 2 unit\n\nThe value of this to Player 2 will be:\nItem 1: 1 * v1\\_2\nItem 2: 1 * v2\\_2\nItem 3: 2 * v3\\_2\nItem 4: 2 * v4\\_2\nItem 5: 2 * v5\\_2\n\nMy value from this is:\nItem 1: 1 * 70 = 70\nItem 2: 1 * 48 = 48\nItem 3: 1 * 28 = 28\nItem 4: 2 * 68 = 136\nItem 5: 2 * 31 = 62\nTotal: 70 + 48 + 28 + 136 + 62 = 344\n\nThis is even worse. I need to offer more.\n\nLet's try offering\n*Item 1: 1 unit\n*Item 2: 1 unit\n*Item 3: 2 unit\n*Item 4: 3 unit\n*Item 5: 3 unit\n\nThe value of this to Player 2 will be:\nItem 1: 1 * v1\\_2\nItem 2: 1 * v2\\_2\nItem 3: 2 * v3\\_2\nItem 4: 3 * v4\\_2\nItem 5: 3 * v5\\_2\n\nMy value from this is:\nItem 1: 1 * 70 = 70\nItem 2: 1 * 48 = 48\nItem 3: 1 * 28 = 28\nItem 4: 1 * 68 = 68\nItem 5: 1 * 31 = 31\nTotal: 70 + 48 + 28 + 68 + 31 = 245\n\nThis is even worse. I need to offer more. The only other alternative is to be more generous with the splitting. Let's try offering:\n*Item 1: 1 unit\n*Item 2: 1 unit\n*Item 3: 2 unit\n*Item 4: 3 unit\n*Item 5: 4 unit\n\nThe value of this to Player 2 will be:\nItem 1: 1 * v1\\_2\nItem 2: 1 * v2\\_2\nItem 3: 2 * v3\\_2\nItem 4: 3 * v4\\_2\nItem 5: 4 * v5\\_2\n\nMy value from this is:\nItem 1: 1 * 70 = 70\nItem 2: 1 * 48 = 48\nItem 3: 1 * 28 = 28\nItem 4: 1 * 68 = 68\nItem 5: 0 * 31 = 0\nTotal: 70 + 48 + 28 + 68 + 0 = 214\n\n**Offer to Player 2:**\n*   Item 1: 0 unit\n*   Item 2: 0 unit\n*   Item 3: 0 unit\n*   Item 4: 2 unit\n*   Item 5: 2 unit\n\nMy value from this is:\nItem 1: 2 * 70 = 140\nItem 2: 2 * 48 = 96\nItem 3: 3 * 28 = 84\nItem 4: 2 * 68 = 136\nItem 5: 2 * 31 = 62\nTotal: 140 + 96 + 84 + 136 + 62 = 518\n\nIf I gave up item 1, it would equal 578.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 39 x 2 + 36 x 1 + 37 x 1 + 61 x 0\n    which is 151 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 152. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I want to maximize my expected payoff, considering the discount factor and the possibility of Player 2 walking away. A good starting point is to offer Player 2 something that is slightly better than half of the total value, but also considering my outside offer.\n\nMy strategy is to offer a split that gives me slightly more than my outside offer if accepted. This gives me a good chance of getting a deal better than my outside offer, while also giving Player 2 an incentive to accept. To make a simple offer, I'll focus on items that are relatively less valuable to me. I will try to offer a split that gives me around 220-230 in value.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (value to me: 69, remaining: 3)\n- 2 units of item 2 (value to me: 15, remaining: 2)\n- 4 units of item 3 (value to me: 5, remaining: 3)\n- 2 units of item 4 (value to me: 5, remaining: 2)\n- 0 units of item 5 (value to me: 48, remaining: 1)\n\nValue of offer to Player 2: item1*v1+item2*v2+item3*v3+item4*v4+item5*v5\nValue to me if Player 2 accepts: (3*69) + (2*15) + (3*5) + (2*5) + (1*48) = 207 + 30 + 15 + 10 + 48 = 310\n\nI'll start with this offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 0 + 29 x 3 + 63 x 1 + 62 x 2 + 11 x 1\n    which is 285 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 286. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 560. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 560. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 6 + 29 x 1 + 23 x 0 + 26 x 1 + 65 x 0\n    which is 559 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 560. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Item 5 is my second most valuable item (65).\n   \n   Let me propose a counteroffer where I give:\n   - 3 units of item 1 (keeping 5 for myself)\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (keeping 1 for myself)\n   - 2 units of item 3 (keeping 0 for myself)\n   - 4 units of item 4 (keeping 2 for myself)\n   - 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 2 for myself)\n   \n   Value to me of what I'd keep:\n   - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 84 = 420\n   - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n   - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 23 = 0\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n   \n   Total value = 631, which is still better than my outside offer.\n\nHowever, Player 1's initial offer actually gives me a very good deal at 933. Making a counteroffer would likely lead to a less favorable outcome for me.\n\nMy decision: Since the current offer gives me a value of 933, which is significantly better than both my outside offer (560) and the counteroffer I was considering (631), I should accept it.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This means I would receive 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nMy private values are: 94 for item 1, 85 for item 2, 68 for item 3, 46 for item 4, 15 for item 5.\n\nSo the value of Player 2's offer to me is:\n(3 * 94) + (1 * 85) + (1 * 68) + (3 * 46) + (2 * 15) = 282 + 85 + 68 + 138 + 30 = 603\n\nNow, we must consider the discount factor. Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Therefore, the present value of the offer is 603 * 0.9 = 542.7.\n\nMy outside offer is 429. Since 542.7 is greater than 429, accepting the offer is better than walking away *at this point*.\n\nNow, should I make a counteroffer? We need to consider what would happen in round 3. If I make a counteroffer, and Player 2 makes a counteroffer in response in round 3, it will be treated as a walk. Therefore, if I make a counteroffer, Player 2 will either accept, or walk.\n\nLet's calculate my value if I took everything:\n8 * 94 + 1 * 85 + 2 * 68 + 4 * 46 + 6 * 15 = 752 + 85 + 136 + 184 + 90 = 1247\n\nLet's start by making an offer that is barely better than the outside option of 429 for player 2.\nPlayer 2's values are unknown. Since the values range from 1 to 101, I will make a rough assumption that player 2's values are similar to my values.\nSince the offer to me has a value of 603, I would make a counter offer where Player 2 gets slightly more than their outside offer, and I get most of the pie. I will make an offer to give player 2 [5, 1, 1, 3, 4]\nThe amount I get is [3, 0, 1, 1, 2].\n\nValue to me is 3*94 + 0*85 + 1*68 + 1*46 + 2*15 = 282 + 0 + 68 + 46 + 30 = 426\nValue to me discounted = 426 * 0.9 = 383.4\n\nThis is less than the outside option of 429.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 5, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 2 + 44 x 0 + 21 x 5 + 79 x 2 + 83 x 1\n    which is 450 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 451. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 0, 0, 3, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 0, 4, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 0, 4, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. It's round 2, and Player 2 has offered me [3, 0, 4, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n* Item 1: 3 units (Player 2 offer) - meaning Player 2 gets 5-3 = 2 units\n* Item 2: 0 units (Player 2 offer) - meaning Player 2 gets 0-0 = 0 units\n* Item 3: 4 units (Player 2 offer) - meaning Player 2 gets 5-4 = 1 unit\n* Item 4: 1 units (Player 2 offer) - meaning Player 2 gets 6-1 = 5 units\n* Item 5: 1 units (Player 2 offer) - meaning Player 2 gets 6-1 = 5 units\n\nMy values are: 2 for item 1, 91 for item 2, 92 for item 3, 11 for item 4, and 41 for item 5.\n\nTherefore, the value of Player 2's offer to me is:\n(3 * 2) + (0 * 91) + (4 * 92) + (1 * 11) + (1 * 41) = 6 + 0 + 368 + 11 + 41 = 426.\n\nNow we discount this value by gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.  So the present value of accepting this offer is 426 * 0.9 = 383.4.\n\nSince my outside offer is 499, accepting the current offer (even with the discount factor) is worse than walking away. I need to make a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer when discounted.\n\nLet's consider making an offer that gives the other player only the items they value least. Since their offer was [3, 0, 4, 1, 1], let's assume they also value the items similarly to how I do. I value item 2 highly, so I want to keep that if there was any. I value item 3 highly as well.\n\nMy current assessment is that I should attempt to get more of Items 3, 4, and 5. I can't get more of item 2, but could potentially push for more of Item 1 as well.\n\nLet's see what happens if I offer the other player [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].  This means I keep everything.  My value is (5*2) + (0*91) + (5*92) + (6*11) + (6*41) = 10 + 0 + 460 + 66 + 246 = 782.  The discounted value is 782 * 0.9 = 703.8. This is a significant improvement over my outside option. However, Player 2 is unlikely to accept this.\n\nI need to determine a reasonable counteroffer. My goal is to get at least 499/0.9 = 554.4 worth of items.\n\nLet's try offering [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]. This means I get:\nItem 1: 4 * 2 = 8\nItem 2: 0 * 91 = 0\nItem 3: 2 * 92 = 184\nItem 4: 6 * 11 = 66\nItem 5: 6 * 41 = 246\nTotal: 504\nDiscounted value = 504 * 0.9 = 453.6. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 2, 0, 0].\nItem 1: 5 * 2 = 10\nItem 2: 0 * 91 = 0\nItem 3: 3 * 92 = 276\nItem 4: 6 * 11 = 66\nItem 5: 6 * 41 = 246\nTotal: 598\nDiscounted value: 598 * 0.9 = 538.2\n\nThis is better than my outside option.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 5, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    52 x 2 + 44 x 0 + 21 x 5 + 79 x 2 + 83 x 1\n    which is 450 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 451. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My values for these items are 2, 91, 92, 11, and 41. Thus, the value of this offer to me is:\n\n(3 * 2) + (0 * 91) + (4 * 92) + (1 * 11) + (1 * 41) = 6 + 0 + 368 + 11 + 41 = 426\n\nSince this is the final round, there is a discount factor of 0.9^(3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81. Therefore, the present value of accepting this offer is 426 * 0.81 = 345.06.\n\nMy outside offer is worth 499.  Therefore, accepting the current offer (worth 345.06) is worse than walking away (worth 499).\n\nI should try a counteroffer. To determine a good counteroffer, I need to consider what Player 2 might accept. I want to give them as little as possible while still making it better than their outside offer. I do not know their outside offer, but given the values they have presented previously, I can safely assume that they will not accept an offer of significantly less than what they had offered me.\n\nLet's revert to my offer of Round 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 0, 0]. This means I would receive [5, 0, 3, 6, 6] units of items 1 through 5. This offer has a value to me of:\n\n(5 * 2) + (0 * 91) + (3 * 92) + (6 * 11) + (6 * 41) = 10 + 0 + 276 + 66 + 246 = 598\n\nThe present value would be 598 * 0.81 = 484.38. This is still less than my outside offer of 499.\n\nI must make a better offer to Player 2 than they are currently giving me, if I wish to accept the outcome. Otherwise, I am better off walking away with my 499. Player 2 offered [3, 0, 4, 1, 1] in round 2. This means they want to keep [2, 0, 1, 5, 5]. In order to make my counteroffer as close to the outside offer value as possible, it will need to favour player 2. \n\nGiven that the current value to me is 426, and if I could somehow push that to 499, I would take it. I don't think I can move that much value in this round. \n\nBased on the above, it is best for me to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 486. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 480 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's think step by step.\n\nMy private values are:\nItem 1: 12\nItem 2: 11\nItem 3: 66\nItem 4: 33\nItem 5: 38\n\nTotal items:\nItem 1: 7\nItem 2: 9\nItem 3: 8\nItem 4: 4\nItem 5: 1\n\nMy outside offer: 486\n\nI need to make an initial offer to Player 2.  I want to maximize my outcome, considering the discount factor in subsequent rounds.  Since this is round 1, there's no offer from Player 2 yet.\n\nA good starting point would be to offer Player 2 something that's slightly better than an even split based on item counts, but prioritizing giving them more of the items I value less.  Let's start by giving them a majority of items 1 and 2, a near even split of item 3 and 4, and little of item 5 since its supply is extremely limited.\n\nLet's consider offering:\nItem 1: 4\nItem 2: 5\nItem 3: 4\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 0\n\nMy value if this offer is accepted:\nItem 1: (7-4) * 12 = 3 * 12 = 36\nItem 2: (9-5) * 11 = 4 * 11 = 44\nItem 3: (8-4) * 66 = 4 * 66 = 264\nItem 4: (4-2) * 33 = 2 * 33 = 66\nItem 5: (1-0) * 38 = 1 * 38 = 38\nTotal Value: 36 + 44 + 264 + 66 + 38 = 448\n\nThis offer's value to me is 448. This is less than my outside offer of 486. Therefore, I should attempt to negotiate something better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's see how Player 2 might react to a counteroffer that gives them 3 of Item 1, 4 of Item 2, 3 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, and 0 of Item 5.\n\nMy Value: (7-3)*12 + (9-4)*11 + (8-3)*66 + (4-1)*33 + (1-0)*38 = 48 + 55 + 330 + 99 + 38 = 570.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 8, 8, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 2 + 74 x 8 + 87 x 8 + 15 x 1 + 52 x 1\n    which is 1403 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1405. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 8, 8, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 2 + 74 x 8 + 87 x 8 + 15 x 1 + 52 x 1\n    which is 1403 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1405. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 0, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [4, 8, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 8, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Since 855 < 1153, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I need to offer Player 2 something that they might accept, while still getting a value higher than my outside offer when discounted. It's likely Player 2's values are different than mine, so guessing what they might accept is hard. I'll aim to get a value close to my outside offer by making a counteroffer that is only slightly less than my ideal division of items based on my own values.\n\nLet's try to get a discounted value of around 1153 / 0.9 = 1281 approximately. My current offer value is 950, to get close to 1281, I need to add about 331. Given that I want to maximize the amount of items I keep given my own values, I will offer Player 2 a counteroffer which gives them only a little bit of each item.\n\nI will try offering [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]. This means I would get:\n* Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2\n* Item 2: 6 - 2 = 4\n* Item 3: 6 - 2 = 4\n* Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3\n* Item 5: 5 - 1 = 4\nValue to me:\n* Item 1: 2 * 39 = 78\n* Item 2: 4 * 70 = 280\n* Item 3: 4 * 93 = 372\n* Item 4: 3 * 38 = 114\n* Item 5: 4 * 29 = 116\nTotal value = 78 + 280 + 372 + 114 + 116 = 960\nDiscounted value = 960 * 0.9 = 864\n\nThis is not greater than my outside offer. I should consider walking away and getting my outside offer value. But to be aggressive, I will try one more counteroffer, and give the minimal amount to Player 2 to see if they accept. If not, then I am guaranteed to get my outside offer if this round fails, and Player 2 likely has high values.\n\nI will offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 2, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 86 x 5 + 81 x 2 + 6 x 2 + 34 x 5\n    which is 774 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 775. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away.\n\nSince walking away gives me a discounted value of 933.93, and accepting the offer gives me a discounted value of 370.98, I should walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 80 x 1 + 28 x 2 + 36 x 3\n    which is 244 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 246. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 97. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1056 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's start by evaluating my outside offer. My outside offer is 97. I need to decide on a strategy that maximizes my expected value, taking into account the discount factor and the limited number of rounds.\n\nSince this is the first round and there's no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. A good starting point is to aim for an equal split of the total value, but I also need to factor in my outside offer and the discount factor. Let's calculate the total value of all the items to me:\n\n*   Item 1: 0 * 94 = 0\n*   Item 2: 5 * 52 = 260\n*   Item 3: 2 * 46 = 92\n*   Item 4: 2 * 68 = 136\n*   Item 5: 1 * 92 = 92\n*   Total Value: 0 + 260 + 92 + 136 + 92 = 580\n\nAn \"equal split\" would be 580 / 2 = 290. I should offer something that gives me at least my outside offer value of 97 after discounting if the negotiation takes longer than one round. I also want to avoid being too greedy, as that will lead to Player 2 walking away.\n\nLet's try to determine a reasonable offer that gives me close to an equal share, but also ensures that Player 2 gets a substantial value from the items. I will offer Player 2 slightly more than half of the total value in order to increase my chances of getting the deal accepted in either round 1 or round 2.\n\nI will offer the following quantities to Player 2:\n\n*   Item 1: 0\n*   Item 2: 3\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 1\n*   Item 5: 1\n\nMy value for what I keep:\n\n* Item 1: 0 * 94 = 0\n* Item 2: 2 * 52 = 104\n* Item 3: 1 * 46 = 46\n* Item 4: 1 * 68 = 68\n* Item 5: 0 * 92 = 0\nTotal: 218\n\nMy plan is to start with this offer and be willing to adjust slightly in the next round if needed, keeping my outside offer in mind.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 96 x 3 + 32 x 0 + 67 x 1 + 9 x 0\n    which is 355 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 356. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 2, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 36 x 1 + 29 x 2 + 45 x 6 + 41 x 2\n    which is 446 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 447. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

So the present value of this offer is:\n*   429 * 0.9^(2-1) = 429 * 0.9 = 386.1\n\n**2. Compare the offer to the outside offer:**\n\nPlayer 1's outside offer is 1005. Since 386.1 < 1005, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\n**3. Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nWe need to determine if there's a counteroffer that Player 1 can make that Player 2 is likely to accept, and that would yield Player 1 a higher value than the outside offer of 1005 after discounting.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 75 x 0 + 20 x 3 + 21 x 5 + 90 x 0\n    which is 165 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 169. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 48 x 4 + 79 x 3 + 81 x 3 + 67 x 0\n    which is 672 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 673. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

To make an informed decision, I should evaluate my previous offer and see if there is an intermediate ground.\nIn round 1 I offered [0, 2, 2, 3, 1] to Player 2. This means I would get:\n- Item 1: 1 * 73 = 73\n- Item 2: 2 * 52 = 104\n- Item 3: 2 * 47 = 94\n- Item 4: 3 * 62 = 186\n- Item 5: 1 * 74 = 74\nTotal Value = 73 + 104 + 94 + 186 + 74 = 531\nDiscounted value = 531*0.9^0 = 531\nPlayer 2's counteroffer implies that Player 2 values the items I wanted to keep more than I do. It might be better to try to get as much as I can before accepting. Let's consider a more extreme counteroffer of [0, 3, 3, 5, 1], which offers player 2 nearly everything.\n\nIf I offer Player 2 [0, 3, 3, 5, 1], I get:\n- Item 1: 1 * 73 = 73\n- Item 2: 1 * 52 = 52\n- Item 3: 1 * 47 = 47\n- Item 4: 1 * 62 = 62\n- Item 5: 1 * 74 = 74\nTotal value = 73 + 52 + 47 + 62 + 74 = 308\nDiscounted value = 308*0.9^0 = 308\nSince 308 is lower than 314.1 (the discounted value of the original offer) I will take the original offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

I need to estimate Player 2's potential values to construct a reasonable offer. Without knowing Player 2's values, I'll aim for a relatively fair split, initially biased toward my more valued items. I'll give Player 2 a good portion of my less valued items and retain most of my highly valued items.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 6, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 5 + 83 x 6 + 11 x 2 + 76 x 2 + 60 x 4\n    which is 1162 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1172. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 2, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This is tricky without knowing their values. A good strategy is to offer them a deal that gives them roughly half the total value of all items, perhaps slightly more. Let's start by giving player 2 a reasonable amount of each item and see where that lands us with respect to my outside option.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 half of each item rounded down. That would be:\n- Item 1: 1 unit\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 2 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 1 unit\n\nNow let's calculate the value of this offer to Player 2 and what that means for me.\n\nIf I offer Player 2 [1, 1, 2, 3, 1], that means I keep:\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 2: 1 unit\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 2 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n- Item 1: 2 * 54 = 108\n- Item 2: 1 * 22 = 22\n- Item 3: 3 * 90 = 270\n- Item 4: 3 * 55 = 165\n- Item 5: 2 * 52 = 104\nTotal value = 108 + 22 + 270 + 165 + 104 = 669\n\n669 is less than my outside offer of 697, so this is not good enough.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 slightly less, to see if I can beat my outside offer. Let's offer [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]:\n\nIf I offer Player 2 [0, 0, 2, 2, 0], that means I keep:\n- Item 1: 3 units\n- Item 2: 2 unit\n- Item 3: 3 units\n- Item 4: 4 units\n- Item 5: 3 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n- Item 1: 3 * 54 = 162\n- Item 2: 2 * 22 = 44\n- Item 3: 3 * 90 = 270\n- Item 4: 4 * 55 = 220\n- Item 5: 3 * 52 = 156\nTotal value = 162 + 44 + 270 + 220 + 156 = 852\n\nOkay, 852 is better than my outside offer of 697.\n\nTherefore, let's offer Player 2 [0, 0, 2, 2, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 2, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 176. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 582 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 32 x 3 + 45 x 1 + 34 x 1\n    which is 175 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 176. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since I don't know their valuations, I will assume they are also drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 101. A reasonable starting point is to offer a split that gives Player 2 slightly more than half the total value, while still ensuring I get more than my outside offer, accounting for the discount factor.\n\nFirst, I will calculate the total value of all items for myself: (4 * 58) + (7 * 3) + (4 * 57) + (2 * 73) + (4 * 93) = 232 + 21 + 228 + 146 + 372 = 999.\n\nLet's try to offer Player 2 a little over half of the items, such as [2, 4, 2, 1, 2].

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 99 x 0 + 1 x 2 + 95 x 0 + 54 x 3\n    which is 164 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 165. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm Player 1, and I want to maximize my discounted value. I have private values for each item: 91 (item 1), 63 (item 2), 14 (item 3), 72 (item 4), and 58 (item 5). I also have an outside offer of 1254. The other player, Player 2, has unknown values and an unknown outside offer. The negotiation will last a maximum of 3 rounds, and the discount factor is 0.9.\n\nSince there's no offer on the table, I need to make an initial offer. A good starting point is to try for an even split, and adjust from there. Let's consider an offer where I give Player 2 half of each item, rounded down. This ensures that all items are distributed, as the other player must receive an integer amount.\n\n*   Item 1: 5 units / 2 = 2.5. Round down to 2 units.\n*   Item 2: 1 unit / 2 = 0.5. Round down to 0 units.\n*   Item 3: 5 units / 2 = 2.5. Round down to 2 units.\n*   Item 4: 7 units / 2 = 3.5. Round down to 3 units.\n*   Item 5: 5 units / 2 = 2.5. Round down to 2 units.\n\nSo, my initial offer to Player 2 is [2, 0, 2, 3, 2]. This leaves me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n*   Item 2: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n*   Item 3: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n*   Item 4: 7 - 3 = 4 units\n*   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of this outcome for me:\n\n*   3 units of item 1: 3 * 91 = 273\n*   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 63 = 63\n*   3 units of item 3: 3 * 14 = 42\n*   4 units of item 4: 4 * 72 = 288\n*   3 units of item 5: 3 * 58 = 174\n\nTotal value = 273 + 63 + 42 + 288 + 174 = 840\n\nSince 840 is less than my outside option of 1254, I would not want to accept this deal as-is. This means that I must offer more to Player 2 to get them to accept the offer. Therefore, it makes more sense to offer an offer with a value exceeding my outside option, knowing that I will earn 90% if they accept it.\n\nI will instead make an offer that I know is not acceptable to Player 2, because if they reject the offer, I will make a more reasonable counteroffer in round 3. I'll offer Player 2 just one unit of item 2.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 4 + 55 x 1 + 87 x 0 + 92 x 4 + 5 x 1\n    which is 752 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 753. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

My values are 91, 63, 14, 72, 58 for items 1 through 5, respectively. My outside offer is 1254. The discount factor is 0.9.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of Player 2's offer to me:\n(1 * 91) + (0 * 63) + (1 * 14) + (2 * 72) + (5 * 58) = 91 + 0 + 14 + 144 + 290 = 539\n\nSince it's round 2, we need to consider the discount factor. If I accept now, my value will be 539 * 0.9^(2-1) = 539 * 0.9 = 485.1\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 1254. Therefore, I shouldn't accept this offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. To make a smart counteroffer, I need to consider my own values and the remaining rounds. Since it's round 2, there's only one round left after this one. If I make a counteroffer now, Player 2 can either accept or walk away in round 3. I need to make an offer that is attractive enough for Player 2 to accept, but still gives me more value than walking away.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items for me:\n(5 * 91) + (1 * 63) + (5 * 14) + (7 * 72) + (5 * 58) = 455 + 63 + 70 + 504 + 290 = 1382\n\nLet's consider offering Player 2 just enough to make them indifferent between accepting my offer in round 3 and walking away with their outside option (which I do not know). This is tricky since I don't know Player 2's values or outside offer.\n\nLet's try to aim for a split where I get slightly more than my outside offer after the discount. I want to have a discounted value close to my outside offer 1254. So, my target value in round 2 would be 1254 / 0.9 = 1393.33\n\nLet's aim to keep 3 units of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 3 of item 5. This means I offer Player 2:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 1\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2\n\nThe value of what I keep:\n(3 * 91) + (0 * 63) + (3 * 14) + (5 * 72) + (3 * 58) = 273 + 0 + 42 + 360 + 174 = 849\n\nThis is less than my target value of 1393.33. I made a mistake with my target value. My target value should be based on the fact I am playing this round NOW. If they accept in round 3, that gets discounted. If they accept this round, it does not. I want to keep enough to have a value just above my current outside offer of 1254.\n\nLet's try keeping 4 units of item 1, 1 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 6 of item 4, 4 of item 5. I would then offer Player 2:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 1\nItem 5: 1\n\nMy value:\n(4 * 91) + (1 * 63) + (4 * 14) + (6 * 72) + (4 * 58) = 364 + 63 + 56 + 432 + 232 = 1147\n\nThis is still less than 1254.\n\nHow about keeping all the good items? 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 4. No units of item 3 or 5. Offer: [0, 0, 5, 0, 5]\nMy Value: (5*91)+(1*63)+(5*72) = 455 + 63 + 360 = 878\n\nStill less than 1254. Something is wrong with this logic since I can have more value keeping SOME of all the items, but cannot reach my outside offer.\n\nGiven that my value of accepting the current offer in round 2 is only 485.1 and I need above 1254, I will make a counter offer to try to reach it.\n\nLet me try to aim a bit higher and offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 753. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 960 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    81 x 4 + 55 x 1 + 87 x 0 + 92 x 4 + 5 x 1\n    which is 752 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 753. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 5]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 2 + 95 x 4 + 7 x 1 + 99 x 1 + 72 x 2\n    which is 822 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 823. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Even though Player 2's earlier offers to me were worse ([1,1,1,0,2] and [1,1,2,0,1]), I have to factor in the discount.\n\nI think I'll make the counteroffer of [2, 3, 1, 0, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 2 + 95 x 4 + 7 x 1 + 99 x 1 + 72 x 2\n    which is 822 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 823. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 5, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 4 + 82 x 0 + 4 x 5 + 7 x 1 + 20 x 4\n    which is 507 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 508. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 541. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 541. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 6, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 6, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe current offer gives me:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 6 units of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nMy values for these items are:\n- Item 1: 31\n- Item 2: 86\n- Item 3: 6\n- Item 4: 79\n- Item 5: 37\n\nSo the value of the current offer to me is:\n(1 * 31) + (0 * 86) + (6 * 6) + (1 * 79) + (2 * 37) = 31 + 0 + 36 + 79 + 74 = 220\n\nSince this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\nThe present value of accepting this offer is 220 * 0.9 = 198\n\nMy outside offer is 541. Since 198 < 541, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, so I need to keep as many items as possible that I value highly.\nI have the following quantities available:\n- Item 1: 7\n- Item 2: 0\n- Item 3: 7\n- Item 4: 2\n- Item 5: 4\n\nI need to offer *something* to player 2. I could try to give player 2 only item 3, since I value it the least.\n\nLet's offer the following to Player 2: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 7 -> 7 * 31 = 217\n- Item 2: 0 -> 0 * 86 = 0\n- Item 3: 0 -> 0 * 6 = 0\n- Item 4: 2 -> 2 * 79 = 158\n- Item 5: 4 -> 4 * 37 = 148\nTotal value: 217 + 0 + 0 + 158 + 148 = 523\nPresent Value = 523 * 0.9 = 470.7\nThis is still less than my outside offer, so it's also not a good deal.\n\nSince it's Round 2, I should make a counteroffer that is better than my walkaway value after applying the discount factor. I need to find a better counteroffer. Let's consider giving away all of item 3, a single unit of item 1, and one unit of item 5. This counteroffer would be [1, 0, 7, 0, 1].\n\nThis leaves me with\n6 units of item 1 = 6 * 31 = 186\n0 units of item 2 = 0 * 86 = 0\n0 units of item 3 = 0 * 6 = 0\n2 units of item 4 = 2 * 79 = 158\n3 units of item 5 = 3 * 37 = 111\nTotal value = 186 + 0 + 0 + 158 + 111 = 455\nPresent value = 455 * 0.9 = 409.5\n\nLet's try another counteroffer to give up only the items I don't value:\n[0, 0, 7, 0, 4]\nThis leaves me with:\nItem 1: 7 -> 7 * 31 = 217\nItem 2: 0 -> 0 * 86 = 0\nItem 3: 0 -> 0 * 6 = 0\nItem 4: 2 -> 2 * 79 = 158\nItem 5: 0 -> 0 * 37 = 0\nTotal Value: 375\nPresent Value: 337.5\n\nIt's still not worth it, I am better off walking away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n",
