Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 130. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1011 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since it's round 1, the discount factor impact is not applied yet.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer:** There is no current offer on the table, so I need to propose an initial offer.\n  \n- **Potential counteroffers:**\n  - I need to propose an offer that, if rejected, allows me to retain more than the value of my outside offer (130). \n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nTo ensure I receive at least my outside offer value, I will create a counteroffer that gives me a good value based on my valuation of the items. Here is a potential division that takes into account maximizing my value:\n  \n- I propose to offer Player 2 the following division:\n  - 0 units of item 1 (keeping 3 units for myself)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (keeping 4 units for myself, value: 4x77=308)\n  - 0 units of item 3 (keeping 1 unit for myself, value: 1x42=42)\n  - 0 units of item 4 (keeping 4 units for myself, value: 4x100=400)\n  - 2 units of item 5 (keeping 4 units for myself, value: 4x98=392)\n\nWith this, my total value becomes 1142, which is significantly above my outside offer value of 130. \n  \nTherefore, I will proceed with this counteroffer to maximize my value and avoid mistakes such as offering less than my outside offer or mistakenly accepting a suboptimal deal.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1100. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 6, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 6, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the optimal action, let's proceed step-by-step through the questions:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1100.\n  \n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 92\n  - Item 2: 6\n  - Item 3: 24\n  - Item 4: 35\n  - Item 5: 70\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 8 units of item 4\n  - 7 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since it is round 1, the discount doesn't apply due to (r-1) being 0 (gamma^0 = 1).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer Value**: To calculate the value of the current offer to me, consider the quantities:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 92 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n  - 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 35 = 210\n  - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 70 = 280\n\n  Total value = 0 + 6 + 24 + 210 + 280 = 520\n\n- **Compare to Outside Offer**: My outside offer is 1100, which is significantly higher than the 520 value of the current offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n1. **ACCEPT**: This would give me a value of 520, which is lower than my outside offer of 1100. Therefore, this is not a rational choice.\n\n2. **WALK**: Currently, my best guarantee is 1100, which is better than the current offer.\n\n3. **COUNTEROFFER**: I need a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1100 to make it worth considering over my outside offer. Let's make one:\n   - **Example Offer to Player 1**: Attempt a counteroffer beneficial for me:\n     - 0 units of item 1 for Player 1 (I keep all 3)\n     - 2 units of item 2 for Player 1 (I keep 2 \u00d7 6 = 12 value units)\n     - 2 units of item 3 for Player 1 (I keep 2 \u00d7 24 = 48 value units)\n     - 7 units of item 4 for Player 1 (I keep 1 \u00d7 35 = 35 value units)\n     - 6 units of item 5 for Player 1 (I keep 1 \u00d7 70 = 70 value units)\n\n   **Proposal Calculation**:\n   - Value of keeping:\n     - 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 from item 1\n     - 2 \u00d7 6 = 12 from item 2\n     - 2 \u00d7 24 = 48 from item 3\n     - 1 \u00d7 35 = 35 from item 4\n     - 1 \u00d7 70 = 70 from item 5\n   - Total value by keeping = 441\n\nThe value by keeping 441 doesn't provide enough to beat the outside offer of 1100. A better proposal or walking away will be advisable. Walking looks most feasible. \n\n### Decision \n\nGiven the current standings, I will choose:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 3, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 23. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 810 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 515. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 810 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 5, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 4, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 4, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

The value in later rounds would be discounted as: Value * 0.9^(round-1). \n\n2. **Assess the Current Offer:**\n   - Current offer to me: [1, 0, 0, 4, 3]\n   - My total value if I accept this offer:\n     - Value from 1 unit of item 1 = 1 * 98 = 98\n     - Value from 0 units of item 2 = 0 * 73 = 0\n     - Value from 0 units of item 3 = 0 * 3 = 0\n     - Value from 4 units of item 4 = 4 * 44 = 176\n     - Value from 3 units of item 5 = 3 * 52 = 156\n     - Total value = 98 + 0 + 0 + 176 + 156 = 430\n\n3. **Compare with Outside Offer:**\n   - The value of the current offer (430) is less than my outside offer (515).\n   - Accepting this would be worse than my outside option, so I should not ACCEPT.\n\n4. **Make a Decision:**\n   - I should not WALK at this stage, as I can propose a counteroffer.\n   - I need a counteroffer that gives me at least 515 worth, considering the discount that will apply if this goes to the next round.\n\n5. **Formulate a Counteroffer:**\n   - I previously offered [2, 0, 0, 5, 0], and Player 2 countered with [1, 0, 0, 4, 3], I need to increase my own value while making it still appealing to Player 2.\n  \n   Let's consider:\n   - Items to retain: [4, 1, 2, 4, 6]\n     - Value = (4 * 98) + (1 * 73) + (2 * 3) + (4 * 44) + (6 * 52) = 392 + 73 + 6 + 176 + 312 = 959\n     - The offer to Player 2 will be: [1, 0, 0, 4, 4]\n\nTherefore, I will make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 4, 4]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's go through the steps outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 700.\n   - My values for the items are: \n     - Item 1: 75 per unit\n     - Item 2: 99 per unit\n     - Item 3: 34 per unit\n     - Item 4: 60 per unit\n     - Item 5: 70 per unit\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor decreases the value of any deal that takes multiple rounds. However, it's round 1, so the full value of my agreed division applies if settled in this round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - No current offer is on the table, so I\u2019ll need to compute values for potential offers I consider making.\n   - To outperform my outside offer of 700, I must keep portions of the items that equal or exceed this value.\n   - Calculating my ideal value: \n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 99 = 99\n     - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 34 = 204\n     - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 60 = 180\n     - 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n     - Total of all items (if I keep everything): 225 + 99 + 204 + 180 + 350 = 1058\n   - To offer a balanced counteroffer that maximizes my value while being reasonable to Player 2, I need to retain items valued higher than 700 to me.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - One potential offer could be to leave enough value to me above my outside offer. \n   - Suppose I keep all of Item 2 and Item 5, I need to compute this value.\n   - Let's offer Player 2: \n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 0 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n\n**Calculating my retained value with this offer:**\n   - Item 1: 0 units, value = 0\n   - Item 2: 1 unit, value = 99\n   - Item 3: 0 units, value = 0\n   - Item 4: 1 unit, value = 60\n   - Item 5: 2 units, value = 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n   - Total retained value = 99 + 60 + 140 = 299\n\n**Counteroffer computation error:**\nThe retained value is clearly less than 700. As such, an alternative must be assessed in which I can make sure to retain a value above 700 by adjusting the proportion of high-value items.\n\nHere\u2019s a better offer distribution:\n   - Offer everything except:\n     - 1 unit of item 2 \n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n\n**New retained value:**\n   - Item 1: 0 units, value = 0\n   - Item 2: 1 unit, value = 99\n   - Item 3: 0 units, value = 0\n   - Item 4: 3 units, value = 180\n   - Item 5: 5 units, value = 350\n   - Total retained value = 99 + 180 + 350 = 629\n\n**Next Better Offer Computation:** Still short of target minimum 700.\n\nThus, offer a different configuration to keep high-value units while giving less than half of most items:\n   - Offer Player 2:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 0 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3 \n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n\n**Retained Value** (alternative):\n- Item 1: retain 1 unit = 75\n- Item 2: retain 1 unit = 99\n- Item 3: retain 3 units = 102\n- Item 4: retain 1 unit = 60\n- Item 5: retain 2 units = 140\n- Total retained value = 75 + 99 + 102 + 60 + 140 = 476\n\nUltimately, a beneficial counter requires more from high-value units to ensure 700+ critical earnings.\n\nTo address this, a more plausible and beneficial offer is:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 2, 4]} \n\nKeeping Items order strictly beneficial. Therefore adjustments are entirely required to make desirable achievement.\n\nProvide an alternate well-evaluated offer, or take the certain fallback:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"} If confident exceptions are logged as invalid.\n",

Since it's the first round, the factor is `gamma^0` which is 1, so there's no discount applied yet.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer [2, 0, 0, 2, 3]:**\n  - Item 1: 2 units = 2 * 38 = 76\n  - Item 2: 0 units = 0 * 73 = 0\n  - Item 3: 0 units = 0 * 5 = 0\n  - Item 4: 2 units = 2 * 27 = 54\n  - Item 5: 3 units = 3 * 72 = 216\n  - Total Value = 76 + 0 + 0 + 54 + 216 = 346\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer: 346 (Current Offer) vs 607 (Outside Offer)**\n  - The current offer value (346) is significantly less than my outside offer value (607).\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **ACCEPT:** Not an optimal choice since 346 < 607.\n- **WALK:** Always an option to guarantee 607.\n- **COUNTEROFFER:** To avoid making mistakes:\n  - I need to propose a counteroffer with a value higher than 607 for me.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer Calculation:\n\nConsidering all item values and the need to ensure I get a total value greater than my outside offer, I'll keep a strategy offering minimal valuable items:\n\nLet's counteroffer with [3, 0, 0, 3, 2] to Player 1:\n\n- This leaves me with:\n  - Item 1: 2 units = 2 * 38 = 76\n  - Item 2: 2 units = 2 * 73 = 146\n  - Item 3: 1 unit = 1 * 5 = 5\n  - Item 4: 2 units = 2 * 27 = 54\n  - Item 5: 2 units = 2 * 72 = 144\n\n- Total value from this counteroffer: 76 + 146 + 5 + 54 + 144 = 425\n\nThis counteroffer is still less than my outside offer. I need to revise it:\n\nOptimal Counteroffer: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] \n- This leaves me with:\n  - Item 1: 4 units = 4 * 38 = 152\n  - Item 2: 2 units = 2 * 73 = 146\n  - Item 3: 1 unit = 1 * 5 = 5\n  - Item 4: 4 units = 4 * 27 = 108\n  - Item 5: 3 units = 3 * 72 = 216\n   \n- Total value = 152 + 146 + 5 + 108 + 216 = 627\n\nThis value (627) is greater than my outside offer (607).

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 906. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 672 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I should aim for a division where I get a minimum adjusted value above 906.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that the current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it. Walking away gives me 906, which is better than accepting this offer.\n\nFor a counteroffer, I need to calculate a distribution where I get at least a value close to 1007, given the discount in the final round.\n\n**Determine My Counteroffer**:\n\nTo improve my payoff:\n- Keeping more units of high value, especially item 3 and item 5.\n- Example, giving Player 2: [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\n**My Potential Values with Offer**:\n- Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 20 value = 60\n- Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 10 value = 40\n- Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 66 value = 264\n- Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 48 value = 192\n- Item 5: 6 units \u00d7 80 value = 480\n- Total = 1036\n\nAdjusted for further discount factor (since this is the final counter):\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI can offer Player 2 [1, 1, 0, 1, 2], which gives me a total above my outside offer after accounting for discounting. If Player 2 rejects and we reach a later agreement in round 3, it should provide me a higher end adjusted value than the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Accepting would yield a worse outcome.\n   - **WALK:** Walking away guarantees a value of 815 through my outside offer.\n   - **COUNTEROFFER:** I could make a counteroffer aiming for a total value greater than 815.\n     - Let's propose keeping the high-value items:\n       - Offer Player 1: [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]\n       - This means I would keep [3, 5, 4, 4, 6]:\n         - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n         - 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 75 = 375\n         - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 84 = 336\n         - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 84 = 336\n         - 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 16 = 96\n       - Total value: 144 + 375 + 336 + 336 + 96 = 1287\n     - Value of counteroffer to me = 1287, which is greater than my outside offer (815).\n\nGiven the analysis, the optimal choice is to make a counteroffer with a higher value than my outside offer.

Here's one possible calculation:\n\n   - I'll aim to keep the highest value items for myself, ensuring I exceed the value of 969.\n\n   Possible allocation for maximizing my own value:\n   - I'll try to keep as much item 2 and 3 as these have the highest value to me.\n\n   Let's try an offer: \n   - Give 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 61 = 61 to Player 2.\n   - Give 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 to Player 2.\n   - Give 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 100 = 200 to Player 2.\n   - Give 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 81 = 81 to Player 2.\n   - Give 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 52 = 52 to Player 2.\n\n   Remaining for me:\n   - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 61 = 61\n   - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n   - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300\n   - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n   - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n\n   Total value for me = 61 + 300 + 300 + 162 + 104 = 927\n\n   The calculated total value is 927, which is less than my outside offer of 969. Thus, this allocation does not work. I need a better allocation, keeping more high-value items.\n\n   Updated allocation for a better outcome:\n\n   - Give 0 units of item 1 (keep all for me) = 0\n   - Give 2 units of item 2 (keep 4 for me) = 2 \u00d7 100 = 200\n   - Give 1 unit of item 3 (keep 4 for me) = 1 \u00d7 100 = 100\n   - Give 0 units of item 4 (keep all for me) = 0\n   - Give 0 units of item 5 (keep all for me) = 0\n\n   New remaining for me:\n   - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 61 = 122\n   - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n   - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n   - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n   - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156\n\n   Total value for me = 122 + 400 + 400 + 243 + 156 = 1321\n   \n   This new allocation provides a total value of 1321 for me.\n\n3) Decision:\n   - I'll propose giving [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] to Player 2, as this offer maximizes my value to 1321, much higher than my outside offer of 969.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To evaluate the current situation and decide on the next action, let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Current Situation Analysis:\n   - My outside offer value is 726.\n   - My valuations for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 66 per unit\n     - Item 2: 27 per unit\n     - Item 3: 78 per unit\n     - Item 4: 15 per unit\n     - Item 5: 39 per unit\n   - Total pool of items: [2, 6, 5, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer from Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n   - Items I receive: [1, 5, 4, 2, 1] (remaining items after the current offer)\n   - Value calculation:\n     - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 66 = 66\n     - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 27 = 135\n     - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 78 = 312\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n     - Total value of current offer = 66 + 135 + 312 + 30 + 39 = 582\n\n2) Assessing the value:\n   - Current offer gives me a value of 582.\n   - My outside offer value is 726.\n   - The current offer is less valuable than my outside offer; thus, accepting it is not optimal.\n\n3) Decision Making:\n   - The current offer of 582 is worse than my outside offer of 726, so I should not accept it.\n   - Walking away gives me my outside offer value of 726, which is better than the current offer.\n   - I can consider making a counteroffer. It must have a value greater than 726 for me to prefer it over my outside option.\n\nCounteroffer Consideration:\n   - To beat the outside offer and offer fair divisions, I need division proposals such as: [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] maximize the item 3 (as it holds highest value for me) \n   - Calculating the value if I offer [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1:\n     - Items I receive: [2, 4, 4, 3, 3]\n     - Value = (2 x 66) + (4 x 27) + (4 x 78) + (3 x 15) + (3 x 39)\n     - = 132 + 108 + 312 + 45 + 117 = 714 (close enough, but I prefer 3 round reduction in the counter process)\n   - This is almost equivalent to the outside offer value when factoring a slight discount;\n   \n\nNow, I need to decide my action: Making another counteroffer extends the negotiation to the last round where WALK default actions get enforced, accpeting current offer makes my value drops to 582 with factor but potential improvement from player 1 offer later. Therefore, Walking away with secured value gives best wellbeing orientation decision.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1197. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 567 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's go through the steps systematically to decide on the best action in the given situation.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is valued at 615.\n- **Values of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 31 per unit\n  - Item 2: 94 per unit\n  - Item 3: 3 per unit\n  - Item 4: 74 per unit\n  - Item 5: 3 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 7 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. It generally means that the value decreases in future rounds, so reaching a deal sooner is better.\n  \n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **No Current Offer:**\n  - As there is no current offer from Player 2, I must decide on an initial offer or walk.\n  \n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - I have to propose a division of items between Player 2 and myself. The goal is to make sure the value I retain is higher than my outside offer value of 615.\n\n### Calculation for Own Value:\n- Suppose I keep:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 31\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 94\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 3\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 74 = 370\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 3\n\n  **Total Own Value:** = 31 + 94 + 3 + 370 + 3 = 501 (Less than 615, so not acceptable without adjustments).\n\nSince 501 doesn't meet my outside value of 615, I will adjust this proposal to keep more value:\n\n- **New Calculation for Higher Self-Value:**\n  - Keep: \n    - All units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n    - All units of item 4 = 7 \u00d7 74 = 518\n  - Offer the remaining items: \n    - Item 1: 3 units\n    - Item 3: 2 units\n    - Item 5: 5 units\n\n  My new calculation: 282 (items 2) + 518 (items 4) = 800, which is above my outside offer value of 615.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accept, Walk, or Counteroffer:**\n  - I should make a COUNTEROFFER ensuring my value is maximized above my outside offer.\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer\n- Offer Player 2 all units of item 1, 3, and 5, keeping all units of item 2 and item 4 for myself.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 2, 0, 5]}\n```",

                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, let's go through the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **My outside offer value**: 871\n- **Values of the items involved**:\n  - Item 1: 67\n  - Item 2: 40\n  - Item 3: 81\n  - Item 4: 99\n  - Item 5: 44\n- **Total pool of items**: \n  - Item 1: 3\n  - Item 2: 3\n  - Item 3: 2\n  - Item 4: 7\n  - Item 5: 5\n- **Current offer on the table**: 0 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, and 1 unit of Item 5.\n\n- **Discount factor influence**: \n  - We are in round 2. The discount factor is 0.9, so if I was to accept or propose an offer, the value would be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Value of the current offer**:\n  - 0 units of Item 1 = 0 \u00d7 67 = 0\n  - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 40 = 0\n  - 0 units of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 81 = 0\n  - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 99 = 198\n  - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 44 = 44\n  - Total = 198 + 44 = 242\n  - With discount = 242 \u00d7 0.9 = 217.8\n\n- **Compare to outside offer**: 217.8 is far below my outside offer of 871. Accepting this would be a mistake as per Mistake 4 since it's worse than my outside offer.\n\n- **Considering a counteroffer**:\n  - I need to maximize my value while ensuring it's above 871. In the previous round, I offered Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 3, 0].\n  - Let's calculate a fair distribution considering my high values for important items while exceeding my outside offer.\n\nConsidering the maximum units:\n- I should focus on obtaining more from higher-value items like Item 3 and 4.\n\n### Counteroffer Calculation:\nLet's offer Player 1 the following:\n- Give 3 units of Item 1 (0 for me), 1 unit of Item 2 (2 for me), 0 units of Item 3 (2 for me), 2 units of Item 4 (5 for me), 2 units of Item 5 (3 for me).\n\n- **Value of what I'd receive**: \n  - 0 units of Item 1 = 0\n  - 2 units of Item 2 = 80\n  - 2 units of Item 3 = 162\n  - 5 units of Item 4 = 495\n  - 3 units of Item 5 = 132\n  - Total value = 80 + 162 + 495 + 132 = 869\n  - With discount = 869 \u00d7 0.9 = 782.1\n\nEven though this counteroffer does not surpass my outside offer value after the discount, I could consider making a less favorable counteroffer in hopes of an improved deal in the next round which surpasses my outside offer. \n\nHowever, the negotiation should aim for at least meeting the outside offer adjusted for discount immediately, otherwise, there's no advantage in further rounds given we're at round 2.\n\nTherefore, knowing it may fail, I prefer to aim near my outside offer and optimize better with my values:\n\n**My Counteroffer**: [3, 0, 0, 2, 5]\n\nWith this, I maximize my potential with Item 2, 3, and 4, leading to an alternative path. I want majority of high value 3 and 4 later.\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\n\nCounteroffer:\n- **Offering**: [3, 0, 0, 2, 5]\n- **Rationale**: Attempt to create a favorable next scenario maximizing value on crucial items later while not disadvantaging immediate options more\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 2, 5]}\n```",

Therefore, I must propose a division where what I keep is worth more than my outside offer (639).  \n\nLet's consider keeping high-value items and offering fewer high-value items to Player 2:  \nI'll try a few scenarios:\n\n- **Example Offer to Player 2:**\n  \n  Let's try an offer where I keep a high value, perhaps:\n\n  - Offer Player 2: 6 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 3 units of Item 5\n  - Remaining for me: 1 unit of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5\n\n  **Calculate My Value:**\n\n  - 1 unit of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n  - 2 units of Item 2: 79 \u00d7 2 = 158\n  - 1 unit of Item 3: 59 \u00d7 1 = 59\n  - 2 units of Item 4: 17 \u00d7 2 = 34\n  - 2 units of Item 5: 65 \u00d7 2 = 130\n  \n  **Total Value for Me:** 2 + 158 + 59 + 34 + 130 = 383\n\nThis outcome, 383, is significantly less than my outside offer of 639, so this offer won't work.\n\n- **Reassess Offer:**\n  \n  To propose a stronger offer and allow for more value retention, I'll keep more high-value items.\n\n  Let's try another offer:\n\n  - Offer Player 2: 7 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 3 units of Item 5\n  - Remaining for me: 0 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5\n  \n  **Calculate My Value:**\n\n  - 0 unit of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 0 = 0\n  - 2 units of Item 2: 79 \u00d7 2 = 158\n  - 2 units of Item 3: 59 \u00d7 2 = 118\n  - 2 units of Item 4: 17 \u00d7 2 = 34\n  - 2 units of Item 5: 65 \u00d7 2 = 130\n\n  **Total Value for Me:** 0 + 158 + 118 + 34 + 130 = 440\n\nThis is still below my outside option but offers Player 2 more item 1, making it potentially more appealing if they value item 1 highly. However, this still isn't good enough. I may have to give up even fewer of high-value items. \n\n- **Satisfactory Offer Success:**\n\n  On further reflection, it's rational to reject if we can't achieve more than 639 without an item distribution satisfying the criteria. \n\nIn conclusion, finding a correct balance to suit my high outside option leads to less flexibility for offering. Given repeated review failures to propose one keeping more value than 639, it's instead wise to end negotiations, taking a known solid fallback versus inadequate divisions.\n\n### 3) Decision:\n\nBased on the analysis, the optimal strategies for maximizing my payoff \u2014 given the strong outside offer above potential schemes \u2014 are as follows:\n\n- Neither potential initial offer achieves more than strict guarantees.\n- Accepting less in attempts renders ineffective use. \n\nThus, the conclusive action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 438. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 447 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's evaluate the situation step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 438.\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 86 per unit\n     - Item 2: 29 per unit\n     - Item 3: 5 per unit\n     - Item 4: 26 per unit\n     - Item 5: 3 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 7 units of item 5\n   - With a discount factor of gamma = 0.9, accepting offers in later rounds results in a reduced value due to discounting. My goal is to secure an outcome better than my outside offer.\n\n2) Calculate the total value of keeping all items (not a feasible strategy, but establishes a value baseline):\n   - Total value if I keep all items:\n     - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 86 = 344\n     - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n     - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n     - Item 5: 7 \u00d7 3 = 21\n     - Total = 537\n\n3) I need to propose a division that maximizes my value while providing Player 2 with enough to consider accepting. I'll need to stay above my outside offer value (438) while making a fair counteroffer.\n\nGiven the values, here is a potential counteroffer strategy:\n- Offer Player 2 fewer high-value items while retaining enough item value myself to exceed my outside offer.\n\nLet's try the following distribution:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\nMy retained items and their value:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nTotal value = 258 + 29 + 5 + 78 + 12 = 382\n\nThis is below my outside offer. I need to adjust the offer to retain more value.\n\nAdjusting the offer:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\nRecalculating my retained value:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nTotal value = 258 + 29 + 10 + 78 + 12 = 387\n\nStill below my outside offer. \n\nI'll propose giving Player 2 even fewer high-value items:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 0 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\nRecalculating my retained value:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nTotal value = 258 + 29 + 10 + 104 + 12 = 413\n\nFinally, this offer remains slightly below my outside offer, but exceeds earlier attempts and might be acceptable in round 1, considering discounts on future rounds might make this feasible if negotiated further.\n\nHence, my decision is to propose:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 3]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 314. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Thus, accepting is not advantageous at the moment.\n   - Walking away now would give me my outside offer, which is 110, more than this offer's value.\n   - Making a counteroffer is a viable option if I aim to gain a value greater than my outside offer, taking into account future rounds and the 0.9 discount factor.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I try to maximize my valuation without making any mistakes that decrease my advantage. I'll aim for a total value close to or better than my current fallback. As such, I'll aim for a counteroffer at least worth 110 to me.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:** Instead of accepting the lesser value allocation Player 1 provided, I'll attempt to secure:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 - Worth to me: 54\n- 1 unit of item 2 - Worth to me: 9\n- 1 unit of item 3 - Worth to me: 14\n- 0 units of item 4 - Worth to me: 0\n- 2 units of item 5 - Worth to me: 4\n\nAttempted value for counteroffer: 54 + 9 + 14 + 4 = 81 (which isn\u2019t enough, so a better arrangement is needed).\n\nHowever, based on total items, a better counteroffer that I can make is:\n\n- Giving them [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] from current remaining items (turn the number being given/kept):\n  - 1 unit of item 1 left for me = 54 value\n  - 2 units of item 2 left for me = 18 value\n  - 2 units of item 3 left for me = 28 value\n  - 0 unit of item 4 = 0 value\n  - 2 units of item 5 for me = 4 value\n   - Total = 54 + 18 + 28 + 0 + 4 = 104 (invalid, need further arrangement and correction)\n\nTherefore, I will give 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 in the counteroffer, so:\n\n- Proposal: [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCalculations:\n- Taking the rest means: [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]\n- Total value = 2*54 + 2*9 + 1*14 + 1*2 = 162 + 18 + 14 + 2 = 196 (This exceeds the outside offer value, good proposition)\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 2]}",

The effect is minimal in round 1 for evaluating counteroffers.\n   \n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   Since there is no offer on the table, I need to formulate an optimal initial offer for Player 2.\n\n   - Calculate my total value if I keep various shares of the items, ensuring it exceeds my outside option (886):\n     - Aiming for a maximum value without being too demanding. For instance, keeping more of the higher-value units (Item 1 and Item 5) where possible and some from others to see if it's still above 886.\n\n   Counteroffer: Let's start by keeping a significant share of my high-value items (item 1, 5).\n\n   Suppose I propose giving Player 2:\n   - 2 units of item 1 (I keep 3)\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (I keep 1)\n   - 5 units of item 3 (I keep 2)\n   - 1 unit of item 4 (I keep 1)\n   - 2 units of item 5 (I keep 2)\n   \n   My Value Calculation:\n   - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 94 = 282\n   - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 36 = 36\n   - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16\n   - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n   - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 89 = 178\n   - Total self value = 282 + 36 + 16 + 9 + 178 = 521\n\n   Clearly, this total doesn't meet my outside offer, indicating I need to revise my offer. The values held aren't enough compared to the fallback option.\n\n   **Counteroffer Revision:**\n   - 1 unit of item 1 (I keep 4)\n   - 1 unit of item 2 (I keep 1)\n   - 4 units of item 3 (I keep 3)\n   - 1 unit of item 4 (I keep 1)\n   - 1 unit of item 5 (I keep 3)\n\n   My Value Calculation:\n   - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 94 = 376\n   - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 36 = 36\n   - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 8 = 24\n   - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n   - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 89 = 267\n   - Total self value = 376 + 36 + 24 + 9 + 267 = 712\n   \n   Again, this still isn't hitting my outside value target.\n\n   Based on iteration and the significant value disparity, let's adjust:\n\n   Final Counteroffer Proposal:\n   - 0 unit of item 1 (I keep 5) \n   - 1 unit of item 2 (I keep 1)\n   - 3 units of item 3 (I keep 4)\n   - 0 unit of item 4 (I keep 2)\n   - 1 unit of item 5 (I keep 3)\n\n   My Value Calculation (after adjustment):\n   - Item 1: 5 units \u00d7 94 = 470\n   - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 36 = 36\n   - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 8 = 32\n   - Item 4: 2 unit \u00d7 9 = 18\n   - Item 5: 3 units \u00d7 89 = 267\n   - Total self value = 470 + 36 + 32 + 18 + 267 = 823\n   \n   **Decision:**\n   Even this revised offer doesn't surpass my outside of 886. I'll need to manage slightly more on items; however, due to the iterative backtrack&mismatch, proceed with a split initially optimal increment towards equilibrium acceptable division. Its net greater than within my request.\n\nIn conclusion, keep adjusting to achievable resolution remaining outside value upper intervention. \n\nTherefore, initially propose optimized structured stance:\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 0, 1]}",

The current offer's value (163) is significantly lower than my outside offer (461).\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer is much worse than my outside option, so accepting it would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away now would ensure I receive my outside offer value of 461, which is better than the current offer. However, since this is round 1 and I have room to make counteroffers, I should consider a counteroffer.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer that provides a higher value than my outside offer or puts me in a better negotiating position without violating any of the mistakes outlined.\n   - An effective counteroffer should utilize the high-value items for me, such as items 1 and 4.\n   \n   One potential counteroffer could be:\n   - Keep most of the items of high value to me.\n   - Offer items of lesser value or lesser quantity.\n\n   A possible counteroffer: Offer Player 1 a distribution where I keep significant units for my valuable items, ensuring my calculated value exceeds 461.\n\n   I aim for a division like:\n   - Giving Player 1: [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]\n   - Keeping for myself: [4, 2, 5, 2, 3]\n   - Estimating my value:\n     - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 82 = 328\n     - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n     - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 29 = 145\n     - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n     - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 27 = 81\n     - Total = 328 + 98 + 145 + 106 + 81 = 758\n\nThis counteroffer yields a value of 758 to me, which is significantly higher than my outside offer.

It means that if I accept a deal in later rounds, my received value will be multiplied by gamma to the power of the rounds that have passed minus one (r - 1).\n\n2) **Assessing the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer**: [0, 3, 3, 2, 0] (keeping these for myself: [1, 3, 2, 2, 1])\n     - Calculate my total value:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 33 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 32 = 0\n     - Total current offer value = 234 + 183 + 142 = 559\n\n   - **Comparison with outside offer**:\n     - The value of the current offer is 559, which is less than my outside offer value of 955.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would result in a value less than my outside offer, leading to Mistake 4.\n   - Making a counteroffer must give me a value greater than 955 to be better for me than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away now without making an offer and taking the outside offer could be strategic if I don't see an easy way to reach a value over 955 with a counteroffer.\n\n   To find a counteroffer:\n   - Let's propose an offer leaving some valuable items: \n     - Offer Player 1 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. This leaves me with 1 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n     - Calculate the value:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n       - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 78 = 312\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n     - Total value = 33 + 312 + 183 + 213 + 32 = 773\n\n   This value (773) is still less than 955. Therefore, I do not currently see a counteroffer that would exceed my outside offer value. Thus, my best course of action based on this analysis is to walk away, as I am not able to propose a viable offer better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my action is to:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's go through the analysis step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n   - **My outside offer value:** 74.\n   - **Values of the items involved:** \n     - Item 1: 88 per unit.\n     - Item 2: 60 per unit.\n     - Item 3: 79 per unit.\n     - Item 4: 27 per unit.\n     - Item 5: 34 per unit.\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - 3 units of item 1\n     - 6 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 8 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor (gamma):** 0.9 indicates that the overall value of the negotiation decreases in future rounds. Hence, the value of the items for me in later rounds would be multiplied by gamma^(r-1), emphasizing the importance of securing a beneficial deal early. However, in round 1, this is not applied yet as the factor for the current round is gamma^0 = 1.0.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Potential Offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** None yet, as this is the first action.\n   - **Initial Proposal for Counteroffer:** We aim to receive a value significantly higher than 74 to ensure that we don't leave value on the table and account for future discounting. I will analyze a potential offer where:\n     - I keep 2 units of item 1 (worth 176 to me) and give 1 unit to Player 2.\n     - I keep 1 unit of item 2 (worth 60 to me) and give 5 units to Player 2.\n     - I keep 2 units of item 3 (worth 158 to me) and give none to Player 2.\n     - I keep 1 unit of item 4 (worth 27 to me) and give 3 units to Player 2.\n     - I keep 3 units of item 5 (worth 102 to me) and give 5 units to Player 2.\n   - **Total value for me from this division:** \n     \\[\n     (2 \\times 88) + (1 \\times 60) + (2 \\times 79) + (1 \\times 27) + (3 \\times 34) = 176 + 60 + 158 + 27 + 102 = 523\n     \\]\n   - This value, 523, is significantly higher than my outside offer value of 74.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - Given the potential offer gives me a significantly higher value than my outside offer (523 > 74), and it's the first round, I should make a counteroffer proposing the above division. This is to avoid mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer) and avoid missing out on potential future gains.\n\nThus, I will propose the following counteroffer to Player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 0, 3, 5]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, as this is round 1, there is no immediate penalty for waiting unless I evaluate the potential counteroffers as less favorable due to discounts.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer from Player 1**: They are offering me [4, 3, 1, 1, 2].\n     - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 16 = 64\n     - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 12 = 36\n     - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 44 = 44\n     - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 50 = 50\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 8 = 16 \n     - Total value = 64 + 36 + 44 + 50 + 16 = 210\n   - **Comparison to outside offer**: The current offer values only 210, which is much lower than my guaranteed outside offer of 480.\n\n3) **Decision-making**:\n\n   - **Accept the current offer**: Not advisable since 210 < 480.\n   - **Walk away**: A consideration if no better offers are likely.\n   - **Propose a counteroffer**: I should aim to construct a counteroffer with a total value greater than my outside option (480).\n     - Proposal to keep a more favorable division: For example [2, 4, 3, 2, 4] for myself, offer the rest to Player 1.\n\n   If I make the counteroffer [4, 3, 1, 1, 1], my value would be: \n   - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 16 = 32\n   - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 12 = 48\n   - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 44 = 132\n   - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 50 = 100\n   - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 8 = 32\n   - Total value = 32 + 48 + 132 + 100 + 32 = 344, which is still under 480.\n\n   Reformulating the offer for better personal value:\n   - Keep [3, 4, 3, 2, 4] and give [3, 3, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1.\n\nMy own value evaluation:\n   - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 16 = 48\n   - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 12 = 48\n   - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 44 = 132\n   - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 50 = 100\n   - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 8 = 32\n   - Total value = 48 + 48 + 132 + 100 + 32 = 360 \n\nEven this fails to exceed my outside option.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on an action, I'll start by evaluating the current situation and potential outcomes:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer is valued at 315.\n- **My Values for the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 50\n  - Item 2: 6\n  - Item 3: 90\n  - Item 4: 14\n  - Item 5: 97\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is 0.9, which means the value of offers diminishes with more rounds. Since this is round 1, the discount factor does not apply yet.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Value of Current Offer [1, 2, 3, 1, 0]**:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n  - 0 unit of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 97 = 0\n\n  Total value = 50 + 12 + 270 + 14 = 346\n\n  Since 346 is greater than my outside offer of 315, accepting this offer would not be a mistake.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I want a division that maximizes my value without making a mistake. A counteroffer shouldn't be worse than the current one.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\n- The current offer gives me a higher value (346) than my outside offer (315).\n- Accepting the current proposal would avoid any mistakes.\n\nTherefore, the best decision at this moment is to:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

However, since we are in the first round, this factor has the least effect right now.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - Currently, there is no offer on the table.\n\n   - **Assess Potential Counteroffers:**\n     Let's determine what portion of the total pool gives me a value higher than my outside offer value of 44.\n\n     If I keep all items:\n     - Value from item 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n     - Value from item 2: 2 * 82 = 164\n     - Value from item 3: 4 * 13 = 52\n     - Value from item 4: 7 * 7 = 49\n     - Value from item 5: 6 * 71 = 426\n     - Total value = 77 + 164 + 52 + 49 + 426 = 768\n\n     Comparing these details, I must ensure any offer I accept or counter that allows me to retain a value greater than 44, without making any mistakes outlined, especially ensuring not to propose offers worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\n   Since I am starting the negotiation, I should make an initial counteroffer that maximizes my value while still leaving some items for Player 2, avoiding offering nothing or everything.\n\n   - Let me offer Player 2 a counteroffer which allows me to retain all of item 5 (which is most valuable for me), two units of item 2, and propose a distribution that is strategically advantageous based on my values.\n\n   Proposed Counteroffer:\n   - Offer Player 2 the following:\n     - 0 unit of item 1\n     - 0 unit of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 0 unit of item 5\n\n   **My retained value:**\n   - Retaining from item 1: 1 * 77 = 77\n   - Retaining from item 2: 2 * 82 = 164\n   - Retaining from item 3: 2 * 13 = 26\n   - Retaining from item 4: 3 * 7 = 21\n   - Retaining from item 5: 6 * 71 = 426\n   - Total retained value = 77 + 164 + 26 + 21 + 426 = 714\n\n   Given my outside offer is 44, I should ensure my retained value is much higher than this outside option.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Given my total possible value is 269, I should aim to keep at least 204/\"1\" (full round 1 value due to gamma).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nLet's calculate a plausible counteroffer, ensuring my share keeps me above my outside offer:\n\n- Example Proposed Division:\n  - **Offer to Player 2:**\n    - 1 unit of item 1\n    - 1 unit of item 2\n    - 2 units of item 3\n    - 2 units of item 4\n    - 0 units of item 5\n  - **My share:**\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n    - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n  - **Total Value to Me:**\n    - 39 + 9 + 28 + 63 + 52 = 191\n\nThe total value to me is 191, which is less than my outside offer of 204, so let's modify the offer to increase my share.\n\n- **Revised Offer to Player 2:**\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 0 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n- **My Revised Share:**\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 7 = 28\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 21 = 84\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n- **Revised Total Value to Me:**\n  - 39 + 18 + 28 + 84 + 52 = 221\n\nNow my revised share's value is 221, which is above my outside offer of 204.\n\n### Decision\n\nI will propose this offer that gives me a value of 221, which exceeds my outside offer of 204, thus maximizing my payoff under negotiation constraints.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 950. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's break down the steps as guided:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - My outside offer value: 950\n   - My values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 58\n     - Item 2: 26\n     - Item 3: 55\n     - Item 4: 75\n     - Item 5: 4\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - Item 1: 4 units\n     - Item 2: 3 units\n     - Item 3: 4 units\n     - Item 4: 6 units\n     - Item 5: 7 units\n   - Discount factor: The negotiation is in round 1, so the discount factor is \\( \\gamma^{(1-1)} = 1 \\). This means no discount is applied at this stage. \n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer by Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3]\n     - My share would be: [4, 3, 4, 3, 4]\n     - Calculating my total value for keeping these items:\n       - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78\n       - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 55 = 220\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n       - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n     - Total value with current offer = 232 + 78 + 220 + 225 + 16 = 771\n\n   - This total value of 771 is less than my outside offer (950), so accepting the current offer would not be beneficial.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\n   - Accepting the current offer would yield a payoff lower than my outside offer, hence it should be declined.\n   - Walking away is an option, but I should also explore possible counteroffers which might exceed my outside offer value.\n   - Let's consider offering Player 1 a division that retains maximum value for myself.\n\nConsidering the utility values, I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than 950.\n\nPotential Counteroffer:\n\nI could try keeping all items except making an appealing counterproposal to Player 1. Since I aim for a strategy to counter their current offer, I\u2019ll experiment by seeking a division prioritizing valuable items to me. For simplicity and effectiveness, I will attempt:\n- Keep all units of high-value items primarily, and offer lesser-value items in exchange to make it fair.\n\nCounteroffer:\n- Let's propose giving them [2, 3, 2, 2, 4] which will mean I keep [2, 0, 2, 4, 3]. \n\nLet's calculate quickly if this counteroffer is viable:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 55 = 110\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 \n\nTotal value using proposed counteroffer = 116 + 0 + 110 + 300 + 12 = 538\n\nUpon reconsidering this offer, it still undercuts my outside offer. Thus, it suggests a revision; perhaps it is better strategically walking away at a next stage and frankly counteroffering strongly won't easily cross my current option of 950, hence the best line foreseeably instead:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 617. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 504 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This affects the present value of accepting delayed agreements.\n\n2) **Value Assessment:**\n\n   - **Current Offer Value:**\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 31 = 62\n     - Total = 495\n\n   After applying the discount factor for round 2:\n   - Discounted Value = 495 * 0.9 = 445.5\n\n   Since 445.5 is significantly lower than my outside offer value of 1292, accepting the current offer is not beneficial.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:**\n\n     I need a counteroffer where my value would be higher than my outside offer (1292 after discount), or at least closer to it while still being plausible to negotiate with Player 2.\n\n     Let's consider keeping more units of higher value items, offering [1, 3, 1, 1, 0]:\n\n     - 8 units of item 1 = 8 \u00d7 28 = 224\n     - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 83 = 332\n     - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 22 = 110\n     - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 42 = 168\n     - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 31 = 155\n     - Total = 989\n\n     Applying the discount factor for round 2:\n     - Discounted Value = 989 * 0.9 = 890.1\n\n     This value is still lower than my outside offer of 1292. I need a more favorable offer.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n\n   To avoid making mistakes, especially Mistake 2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer), I can consider walking away if no better offer is feasible. \n\n   Given that potential counteroffers that I can visualize still remain lower than 1292 after the discount in this round, I conclude that walking away is the best decision to ensure I don\u2019t end worse off than my fallback position.\n\n   **Action:** {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This will reduce the value of any accepted offer in future rounds.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Currently, there is no offer to accept.\n   - I need to decide a potential initial offer to Player 2. The objective is to make an offer that is better than my outside offer value of 211.\n\nLet's calculate a few possible counteroffers and their total values:\n\nFor example, if I offer Player 2:\n- 0 units of Item 1, 0 units of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, 1 unit of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5 (i.e., [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]), I keep:\n  - 5 units of Item 1 = 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n  - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n  - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n  - 3 units of Item 5 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n  - Total value = 832\n\nThe offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 2] gives me a value of 832, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 211.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - Since this is the initial round, I should propose a counteroffer. The offer calculated above respects the constraints, as it is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following initial offer to Player 2:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

However, since we're in round 1, this calculation applies more to future rounds; right now, I compare directly to my outside offer.\n\n2) Assessing counteroffers:\n\nIf I make a counteroffer, it should maximize my value and be greater than 556. \n\nLet's see how many units I want to keep to maximize my value:\n- A possible counter where I keep all item 2 and item 5 could look like this:\n  My kept items: [5 (all of item 1), 2 (all of item 2), 2 (items 3), 0 (item 4), 3 (items 5)]\n\nCalculate the reserved value for a counteroffer where I give Player 1 items: [0, 0, 1, 2, 2]\n- Item 3: (2 units left for me) 2 \u00d7 75 = 150 (meaning I keep two items)\n- Item 4: (0 units left for me) 0 \u00d7 21 = 0\n- Item 5: (3 units left for me) 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (meaning I keep three items)\n\nThese keepings sum to keep an item value for me of 150 + 0 + 159 = 309 worth of value, which is still lower than 556. \n\nI might offer to give away more of item 3 and all of item 4, but let's ensure I keep a good amount of high-value item 5 for better consideration. I strategize for a counteroffer that secures a better sum.\n\n3) Decision:\n\nThe current offer gives me less than my outside offer, so I will make a COUNTEROFFER that keeps more valued items for myself and hopefully a lesser amount of item 4, trying:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 2, 1, 0]}\n\nIf this isn't acceptable or doesn't go through due to game mechanics, I risk the consideration for another better direct arrangement response from Player 1.",

It is important to keep this in mind to not hold out too long if a favorable offer is present.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n- **Current offer:** None (so there's no need to calculate any value for the current offer).\n- **Evaluate a potential counteroffer:** \n  To formulate an advantageous counteroffer, I want to ensure that the value I receive is greater than my outside offer of 34.\n\n#### Let's consider an offer that is advantageous for me:\n\n1. If I offer Player 2:\n   - 1 unit of item 1\n   - 0 units of item 2\n   - 3 units of item 3\n   - 1 unit of item 4\n   - 1 unit of item 5\n\n2. **Items I would receive:**\n   - 1 unit of item 1: \\(49 \\times 1 = 49\\)\n   - 4 units of item 3: \\(76 \\times 4 = 304\\)\n   - 1 unit of item 4: \\(16 \\times 1 = 16\\)\n   - 2 units of item 5: \\(40 \\times 2 = 80\\)\n\n   **Total value for me:** \\(49 + 304 + 16 + 80 = 449\\)\n\nThis value (449) is well above my outside offer of 34, making it a sound strategy. It ensures I secure a high value while allowing Player 2 to receive a significant portion of the items.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\nBased on the calculations and analysis:\n\n- I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my immediate value and is reasonable for Player 2.\n- My calculated value of 449 from the counteroffer is significantly better than my outside offer of 34.\n\nTherefore, I will propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

However, since it's currently round 1, the discount hasn't impacted yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] (amount of each item being offered to me)\n     - Value of 1 unit of Item 1: 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n     - Value of 0 units of Item 2: 0 \u00d7 47 = 0\n     - Value of 1 unit of Item 3: 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n     - Value of 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n     - Value of 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n     - Total value if I accept: 72 + 0 + 87 + 89 + 58 = 306\n\n   - **Compare with outside offer:** The total value of the current offer (306) is less than my outside offer (607). Therefore, accepting this offer would not be beneficial.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to construct a counteroffer where my value is greater than 607. One possibility would be to aim for approximately half of the high-value items or more.\n     - Example counteroffer: [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n       - Value for me:\n         - 2 units of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n         - 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n         - 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (4-1 = 3, as I keep 3 units)\n         - 3 units of Item 4: 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (4-1 = 3, as I keep 3 units)\n         - 2 units of Item 5: 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n         - Total value: 144 + 94 + 261 + 267 + 116 = 882\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - The current offer's value is much less than my outside offer. Walking away for that is not optimal.\n   - The example counteroffer holds a value of 882 to me, which is significantly better than my outside offer and satisfies my goal to receive more than 607 value.\n   - Walking away at this stage would not be strategic due to potential better outcomes.\n\nGiven this analysis, I choose to propose a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, I need to evaluate my situation including my private values for each item, the total available items, my outside offer, and the potential consequences of different actions including proposing a counteroffer. Let's walk through this step-by-step:\n\n### 1) Situation Analysis:\n\n- My outside offer value: **1656**\n- My values for each item:\n  - Item 1: **98**\n  - Item 2: **72**\n  - Item 3: **63**\n  - Item 4: **83**\n  - Item 5: **99**\n- Total available items:\n  - Item 1: **8 units**\n  - Item 2: **3 units**\n  - Item 3: **6 units**\n  - Item 4: **2 units**\n  - Item 5: **3 units**\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- Since there is no current offer from Player 2, I can only consider possible counteroffers.\n- I need to construct a counteroffer that is worth more than my outside offer value of **1656**.\n- Evaluating the total value of keeping all items to myself:\n  - Total value = (8 \u00d7 98) + (3 \u00d7 72) + (6 \u00d7 63) + (2 \u00d7 83) + (3 \u00d7 99) = 784 + 216 + 378 + 166 + 297 = **1841**\n\nSince I can't get any offer more valuable than keeping all items, I need to consider dividing them in a way where I keep enough value without falling below my outside offer value. My goal is to construct a counteroffer that gives me at least approximately **1656** in value after potential discounting.\n\n### Optimal Counteroffer Strategy:\n\nUsing a trial and incremental approach, I aim to give just enough to Player 2 to maintain a value above my outside offer for myself. Let's evaluate a proposed offer:\n\n- Offer [2, 1, 3, 1, 1] to Player 2 (meaning I keep [6, 2, 3, 1, 2]):\n  - My value = (6 \u00d7 98) + (2 \u00d7 72) + (3 \u00d7 63) + (1 \u00d7 83) + (2 \u00d7 99) = 588 + 144 + 189 + 83 + 198 = **1202**\n\n1202 is significantly less than my guaranteed outside offer. I need a higher-value distribution, or I will take no less-than-outside-offer actions like walking away or making an offer more favorable to me:\n\n- Offer [4, 2, 4, 1, 1] to Player 2 (meaning I keep [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]):\n  - My value = (4 \u00d7 98) + (1 \u00d7 72) + (2 \u00d7 63) + (1 \u00d7 83) + (2 \u00d7 99) = 392 + 72 + 126 + 83 + 198 = **871**\n\n871 is still too low. I must consider accepting my fallback or trying to keep all items if I can't propose an offer where I hold sufficient value to justify remaining in negotiations.\n\n### Decision:\n\nAfter testing different combinations, my best strategy here is to be extremely conservative with what I give to Player 2 and avoid making an unacceptable low value trade to myself, given my outside offer. If I couldn\u2019t find an offer that keeps my value past the round 1 reduction greater than my outside offer, WALK is optimal as further holds provide negative outcomes by probability and strategy.\n\n**Offer for strategic benefit that ensures future compliance or divide in logic:**\n\n- Offer [2, 1, 3, 1, 1] (attempt a negotiation stance albeit this actual situation doesn\u2019t reach greatest value though)\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 319. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 651 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 3, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 837. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 687 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 255. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 684 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, since it's round 1, I will consider the full value of potential offers without the discount affecting my immediate round decision.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer from the other player, I need to create an initial offer.\n   - My goal is to create a counteroffer that maximizes my value while exceeding my outside offer value of 118.\n\n3) **Evaluate potential counteroffers:**\n   - I will attempt to maximize my share of high-value items based on my item value perceptions.\n\n   Based on my private values, let's create a counteroffer:\n\n   - If I take:\n     - 4 units of item 1 (4 * 4) = 16\n     - 3 units of item 2 (3 * 58) = 174\n     - 1 unit of item 3 (1 * 25) = 25\n     - 3 units of item 4 (3 * 8) = 24\n     - 3 units of item 5 (3 * 8) = 24\n\n   The total value for keeping those units would be 16 + 174 + 25 + 24 + 24 = 263.\n\n   This ensures the value I attain is greater than my outside offer value of 118 and also aims to maximize my potential value from the negotiation.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n   - I will propose a counteroffer with fewer units of items 1, 3, 4, and 5 (likely perceived to be lower in value by Player 2) while securing more units of item 2, which is highly valuable to me.\n\nThus, I propose the following initial offer to Player 2:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 1, 3]}",

This reduces the value of accepting a deal now compared to if it would have been in the first round, but it also ensures the value is higher now than if it would be in the third round.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer (Offer on Table):** [3, 1, 5, 1, 2] given to me.\n  - Value Calculation:\n    - 3 units of item 1: \\(3 \\times 30 = 90\\)\n    - 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 70 = 70\\)\n    - 5 units of item 3: \\(5 \\times 18 = 90\\)\n    - 1 unit of item 4: \\(1 \\times 68 = 68\\)\n    - 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 50 = 100\\)\n    - Total Value: \\(90 + 70 + 90 + 68 + 100 = 418\\)\n  - Total Value adjusted by discount factor: \\(418 \\times 0.9 = 376.2\\)\n\n- **Compare values:**\n  - Current offer adjusted value: 376.2\n  - Outside offer value: 568\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- The current offer, after adjusting for the discount factor, gives me a value of 376.2, which is less than my outside offer value of 568.\n- Since 376.2 < 568, I should not accept this offer because it is worse than my outside offer (Mistake 4).\n- Should I propose a counteroffer? I need to aim for a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than or equal to 568.\n\n#### Counteroffer Evaluation:\nA beneficial counteroffer must give me items worth at least 568 or something close, considering future negotiations:\n\n1. **Counteroffer Proposal: [2, 0, 4, 0, 1] (leaving 5, 3, 7, 1, 5 for me):**\n   - Value Calculation for what I keep:\n     - 5 units of item 1: \\(5 \\times 30 = 150\\)\n     - 3 units of item 2: \\(3 \\times 70 = 210\\)\n     - 7 units of item 3: \\(7 \\times 18 = 126\\)\n     - 1 unit of item 4: \\(1 \\times 68 = 68\\)\n     - 5 units of item 5: \\(5 \\times 50 = 250\\)\n     - Total Value: \\(150 + 210 + 126 + 68 + 250 = 804\\)\n   - Adjusted Total Value: \\(804 \\times 0.9 = 723.6\\)\n\n723.6 is greater than my outside offer value of 568, so this is a reasonable counteroffer that maximizes my value without falling below the outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 4, 0, 1]}",

It's currently round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer [2, 0, 4, 0, 1]**:\n  - My value from the offer:\n    - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n    - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 86 = 0\n    - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\n    - 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 49 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n  - Total current offer value to me: 50 + 0 + 272 + 0 + 28 = 350\n\n- **Value Adjusted by Discount Factor**:\n  - Adjusted value of current offer: 350 \u00d7 0.9 = 315\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n  - Current offer value (315) is significantly lower than my outside offer (1067).\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n1. **Accept**: Current offer yields a value of 315 (after discount), which is much less than my outside offer of 1067.\n2. **Walk Away**: If no improved possibilities are present, taking the outside offer guarantees 1067. It's a secure, better option compared to the current offer.\n3. **Counteroffer**: I'll aim for a division of items that provides more value, while still considering an attractive offer for Player 1.\n\n### Counteroffer Calculation\n\nIf the other player accepts something that leaves me with a greater value, such as prioritizing high-value items for me:\n- Proposal: [1, 0, 3, 0, 0]\n  - My resulting items:\n    - 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 25 = 150\n    - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n    - 8 units of item 3: 8 \u00d7 68 = 544\n    - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n    - 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 28 = 168\n  - My total value from this scenario: 150 + 258 + 544 + 49 + 168 = 1169\n\n- **Adjusted by Discount**: \n  - 1169 \u00d7 0.9 = 1052.1, which is still slightly below my outside offer.\n\nThus, direct walking away may be more beneficial.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the current situation step-by-step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is valued at 657.\n  \n- **Values of the Items Involved:**  \n  - Item 1: 99 (but 0 units available, so irrelevant)  \n  - Item 2: 53  \n  - Item 3: 12  \n  - Item 4: 72  \n  - Item 5: 98  \n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**  \n  - Item 2: 2 units  \n  - Item 3: 6 units  \n  - Item 4: 6 units  \n  - Item 5: 3 units  \n\n- **Discount Factor Influence:**  \n  - In round 1, the discount factor is \\( \\gamma^{0} = 1 \\). Thus, the value of any agreement reached now is not discounted. It's in my best interest to push for a deal that maximizes value early rather than waiting, which reduces the payoff in subsequent rounds due to the discount factor.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:**\n  - No offer has been made yet.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**  \n  I need to offer items to Player 2 while maximizing the value of the items that I keep. Let's calculate potential offers and their values to me.\n\n  Here's a hypothetical counteroffer:\n  - Offer Player 2: [1 unit of Item 2, 2 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 1 unit of Item 5]\n\n    - My remaining items:\n      - Item 2: 1 unit worth \\(1 \\times 53 = 53\\)\n      - Item 3: 4 units worth \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\)\n      - Item 4: 3 units worth \\(3 \\times 72 = 216\\)\n      - Item 5: 2 units worth \\(2 \\times 98 = 196\\)\n\n  Total value to me = 53 + 48 + 216 + 196 = 513, which is less than my outside offer value of 657.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\nConsidering Mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer), I shouldn't propose an offer that gives me less than my outside offer value. Therefore, I need to make sure that my retained items offer a value greater than 657.\n\nThus, my action will be to make a more favorable counteroffer that allows me to retain a greater value:\n\n### Proposed Counteroffer\n- Offer Player 2: [0 units of Item 2, 4 units of Item 3, 5 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5]\n\nThis counteroffer leaves me with:\n- Item 2: 2 units worth \\(2 \\times 53 = 106\\)\n- Item 3: 2 units worth \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\)\n- Item 4: 1 unit worth \\(1 \\times 72 = 72\\)\n- Item 5: 1 unit worth \\(1 \\times 98 = 98\\)\n\nTotal value to me = 106 + 24 + 72 + 98 = 300, which is still less than my outside offer value of 657. I need to keep more of the high-value items, so let's revise again.\n\n### Revised Counteroffer\n- Offer Player 2: [0 units of Item 2, 6 units of Item 3, 4 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5]\n\nThis leaves me with:\n- Item 2: 2 units worth \\(2 \\times 53 = 106\\)\n- Item 4: 2 units worth \\(2 \\times 72 = 144\\)\n- Item 5: 1 unit worth \\(1 \\times 98 = 98\\)\n\nTotal value: 106 + 144 + 98 = 348, which is still less than the outside offer. It seems based on these calculations, no feasible offer appears to meet or exceed my outside offer. Thus, initially proposing a stringent counteroffer seems critical to reaching that value.\n\nTherefore, to prevent Mistake 2 and given the constraints, I will initially WALK. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This means that delaying an agreement will decrease the overall value in future rounds. It's important to find an agreeable solution sooner rather than later unless a strong offer is anticipated in the future.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nCurrently, there is no offer on the table. However, I can consider making a counteroffer.\n\nLet's consider different potential counteroffers to evaluate how much value we retain. The objective is to propose an offer that maximizes my value while still being above my outside offer of 342.\n\n#### Initial Proposal\nLet's propose an offer where I keep 3 units of each type of item except for Item 5, where I keep 1 unit. This distribution is chosen to maximize my value while still being reasonable:\n\n- Keeping 3 units of Item 1: \\(3 \\times 46 = 138\\)\n- Keeping 3 units of Item 2: \\(3 \\times 32 = 96\\)\n- Keeping 3 units of Item 3: \\(3 \\times 27 = 81\\)\n- Keeping 3 units of Item 4: \\(3 \\times 9 = 27\\)\n- Keeping 1 unit of Item 5: \\(1 \\times 55 = 55\\)\n\n**Total Value:** \\(138 + 96 + 81 + 27 + 55 = 397\\)\n\nThis offer gives me a total value of 397, which is greater than my outside offer of 342.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Offering Strategy**: Propose the counteroffer that allows me to keep 3 units of Items 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 1 unit of Item 5.\n- **Offer to Player 2**: That means offering 1 unit of Items 1, 2, 3 and 3 units of Item 4, plus 1 unit of Item 5.\n\nGiven this analysis, I decide to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

An alternative, strategic counteroffer still seeking to minimize gap while ensuring negotiation value:\n\n- Offer Player 1: [3, 3, 1, 2, 0].\n   - Item 1 (keeping 1 unit): 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n   - Item 2 (keeping 1 unit): 1 \u00d7 29 = 29\n   - Item 3 (keeping 3 units): 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n   - Item 4 (keeping 4 units): 4 \u00d7 36 = 144\n   - Item 5 (keeping 2 units): 2 \u00d7 73 = 146\n   - Total value = 29 + 29 + 147 + 144 + 146 = 495\n\nAlthough 495 still doesn't surpass 724, further adjustments seem limited by available units, aiming higher units of items beyond board suggestion offers diminishing valuation.

The longer I wait, the less valuable an agreement becomes, so it\u2019s important to secure a beneficial offer early if possible.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** None on the table currently, so my action is to propose an initial offer.\n   - **Potential counteroffers (my initial proposal):** \n     If I propose to keep items with the highest value for myself, I should aim to retain those with the highest unit values. Let's try to construct an offer:\n\n     To maximize my value, I prioritize keeping items 1, 2, and 3:\n\n     - Proposal: Keep all of item 1 (2 units), all of item 2 (4 units), and all of item 3 (4 units). Offer Player 2 all of item 4 (4 units) and 6 units of item 5.\n\n     - Value calculation:\n       - Item 1: 2 units \u00d7 76 = 152\n       - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 83 = 332\n       - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 85 = 340\n       - Total value = 152 + 332 + 340 = 824 \n\n     The value of my counteroffer (824) is much greater than my outside offer (283).\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - My offer provides me with a value of 824, which is well above my outside offer of 283, meaning it is a reasonable starting point.\n   - Offering items that are less valuable to me (item 4) and all of item 5 ensures I comply with the requirement of not proposing offers that are worse than my outside offer.\n\nHere's my counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 6]}\n```",

Considering the constraints and item values, let's calculate some potential distributions:\n\n  - One option could be offering the other player fewer units of high-value items and more of low-value ones, but it must still exceed 428 in my value retention.\n\nFor example, I could counter with:\n- Keep 3 of item 1\n- Keep 3 of item 2 (give 2 to Player 1)\n- Keep 5 of item 3 (give 1 to Player 1)\n- Keep 2 of item 4 (give 1 to Player 1)\n\nThis gives:\n  - Item 1: 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 value\n  - Item 2: 3 units \u2192 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 value\n  - Item 3: 5 units \u2192 5 \u00d7 61 = 305 value\n  - Item 4: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 value\n  - Item 5: 4 units \u2192 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 value\n  - **Total value** = 102 + 27 + 305 + 10 + 16 = 460\n\n### Step 3: Make a decision\n\n- Accepting the current offer gives me 149, which is less than my outside offer of 428. Thus, accepting is not viable.\n- My potential counteroffer, as shown, will give me a value of 460, which is better than my outside offer and better than the current proposal.\n- Walking away at this stage would only give me my outside offer value of 428.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best action is to make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

However, if the negotiation progresses to the next round, my payoff would be subject to a discount rate of 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I should propose a counteroffer that ensures my total value is at least 298. I must calculate the value of different possible divisions to ensure I achieve this. \n\n   To calculate my potential counteroffer, I will consider keeping a substantial portion of high-value items (items 2, 3, and 5) and some of the lower value items too. Let's consider a potential division where I aim for above my outside offer value while being fair. I'll make sure to cover my base value of 298:\n\n   Let's give 0 of item 3 to Player 2 (since it's most valuable), and 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 5, and split the rest to try ensuring higher value for myself:\n\n   - **Counteroffer Calculation:**\n     - Player 2 gets 0 units of item 1, so I get 3 units worth 45.\n     - Player 2 gets 1 unit of item 2, so I get 4 units worth 160.\n     - Player 2 gets 0 units of item 3, so I get 5 units worth 375.\n     - Player 2 gets 1 unit of item 4, so I get 2 units worth 66.\n     - Player 2 gets 1 unit of item 5, so I get 8 units worth 280.\n\n   - **Total Value to Me:** 45 + 160 + 375 + 66 + 280 = 926\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Since the counteroffer provides a total value (926) much greater than my outside offer (298), it is a reasonable initial offer.\n   - This counteroffer avoids all known mistakes (e.g., I'm not offering more than the value of my fallback, nor nothing to the opponent).\n\nGiven these considerations, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Keeping all item 2 and offering major in others or proposing to hold maximum from high multiplier sets can work. \n\nLet's rethink:\n\nOffer:\n- Item 1: 0\n- Item 2: 1 (I keep 4)\n- Item 3: 1 (I keep 4)\n- Item 4: 0 (I keep 3)\n- Item 5: 3 (I keep 6)\n\nNew assessment:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 90 = 360\n- Item 3: 4 \u00d7 15 = 60\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 48 = 144\n- Item 5: 6 \u00d7 60 = 360\n- Total = 39 + 360 + 60 + 144 + 360 = 963\n\nI should consider:\n- Adjust and revisit anew deciding on with realistic angle contemplating item units. Given the scope, cutting item allocation isn't ideal this pass. Hence, decision leads:\n\nTherefore, based on re-checked values, I'm leaning heavier on maintaining at minimum same weighted evaluations along efficient player 2 holdings here.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make an informed decision about my initial offer, I will first analyze the current situation:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation**:\n   - **My outside offer value**: 171\n   - **Values of the items involved**:\n     - Item 1: 21 per unit\n     - Item 2: 5 per unit\n     - Item 3: 72 per unit\n     - Item 4: 10 per unit\n     - Item 5: 16 per unit\n   - **Total pool of items**:\n     - 6 units of Item 1\n     - 6 units of Item 2\n     - 1 unit of Item 3\n     - 4 units of Item 4\n     - 6 units of Item 5\n   - **Discount factor influence**: We are in round 1, so the discount isn't applied yet, but future rounds would suffer from the 0.9 discount multiplier. Thus, a decision now has a higher immediate value than in subsequent rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of potential offers**:\n   - Since there is no current offer on the table, I need to propose an initial offer that ensures my value is at least equal to or better than my outside offer in case negotiations fail. I want to keep the maximum possible value without giving an inequitable offer that would cause immediate rejection by Player 2.\n\n3) **Make a decision**:\n   - For an initial offer, I need to calculate the value of various splits and choose one where what I keep has at least my outside offer value.\n   - Example calculation: If I offer Player 2 [3, 3, 0, 2, 3] \u2014 this means:\n     - I keep 3 of Item 1: 3 x 21 = 63\n     - I keep 3 of Item 2: 3 x 5 = 15\n     - I keep 1 of Item 3: 1 x 72 = 72\n     - I keep 2 of Item 4: 2 x 10 = 20\n     - I keep 3 of Item 5: 3 x 16 = 48\n     - Total value I retain = 63 + 15 + 72 + 20 + 48 = 218\n   \n   Since 218 is well above my outside offer value of 171, offering [3, 3, 0, 2, 3] maximizes what I retain while being likely reasonable enough for Player 2 to consider.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

To ensure my proposal is acceptable, it must maximize my value above my outside offer.\n\n- **Calculate My Total Value:**  \n  If I propose an offer I want to evaluate any suggested leftover values for me, which should be more than 678.\n\n### Potential Proposal for Counteroffer\n\nMy goal here is to secure more value than my fallback of 678. Here's a possible structure for maximizing it in a fair start:\n\nAssuming I give away what is potentially less valuable to me (including items that may be more valued to Player 2):\n\n- Retain valuable units based on my valuation.\n  - Keep fullest value chunks and give lesser.\n  \nProposal to give:\n- Item 1: 1 unit to Player 2\n- Item 2: 1 unit to Player 2\n- Item 3: 1 unit to Player 2\n- Item 4: 4 units to Player 2\n- Item 5: 3 units to Player 2\n\nLet\u2019s calculate my retained value if I offer this structure:\n  \n#### Items Retained for Me:\n- **Item 1:** 5 units, (5 * 65) = 325\n- **Item 2:** 2 units, (2 * 40) = 80\n- **Item 3:** 2 units, (2 * 81) = 162\n- **Item 4:** 6 units, (6 * 62) = 372\n- **Item 5:** 0 units, (0 * 1) = 0\n\nTotal Value to Me = 325 + 80 + 162 + 372 = 939\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThis retained value of 939 is significantly above my guaranteed fallback value of 678, and hence a better offer that maximizes my immediate payoff.\n\nTherefore, I will propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 4, 3]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 429. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 558 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

However, there's no current offer on the table, so it doesn't apply immediately.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Currently, there is no offer to evaluate for acceptance.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I will consider offering fewer of the high-value items and checking if what I keep has a value higher than 429 (my outside offer).\n   - I'll calculate possible splits to find a beneficial counteroffer.\n\n3. **Propose a counteroffer:**\n\n   To decide the counteroffer, I will calculate my total value based on what I keep:\n\n   Let's try offering Player 2:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 0 units of item 2\n   - 4 units of item 3\n   - 3 units of item 4\n   - 2 units of item 5\n\n   Calculating my total value with what I keep:\n   - Item 1: 3 x 65 = 195\n   - Item 2: 2 x 5 = 10\n   - Item 3: 4 x 68 = 272\n   - Item 4: 3 x 4 = 12\n   - Item 5: 4 x 44 = 176\n   - Total value = 195 + 10 + 272 + 12 + 176 = 665\n\n   The value of keeping these items (665) is greater than my outside offer (429), satisfying the condition for a valid counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 3, 2]}",

Let me try to improve this.\n\nAdjusting for a more favorable offer:\n\n- Offer 2 units of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n- **Retained Value Calculation:**\n  - Retain 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 70 = 280\n  - Retain 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n  - Retain 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n  - Retain 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n  - Retain 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n\n- **Total Retained Value:** 280 + 96 + 12 + 16 + 15 = 419\n\n419 is still lower than my outside offer. So, further adjust to ensure a retained value higher than the outside offer:\n\nFinally, let's consider offering 1 unit each of items 1 and 4 since these don't contribute as significantly individually:\n\n- Offer 1 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 to Player 2.\n- **Retain:**\n  - 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 70 = 350\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n  - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 15 = 15\n\n- **Total Retained Value:** 350 + 96 + 12 + 16 + 15 = 489\n\nUpon analysis, it appears that given the high value of items 1 and 2 to me, I need to offer even less of these to approach or exceed 582.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 639. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 813 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To decide on what action to take, let's evaluate the current situation by analyzing the steps:\n\n1) **Analyze Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 639.\n   - My private values per unit for each item are: Item 1: 26, Item 2: 99, Item 3: 58, Item 4: 68, Item 5: 20.\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) means if I wait until the next round, my value would multiply by 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the current values remain unchanged.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer: [3, 1, 4, 2, 0] offered to me, meaning I would receive:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 * 26 = 78\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 99 = 99\n     - 4 units of item 3: 4 * 58 = 232\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 68 = 136\n     - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 20 = 0\n     - Total Value = 78 + 99 + 232 + 136 + 0 = 545\n\n   - My total value from accepting this offer is 545, which is lower than my outside offer value of 639.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - I should not accept the current offer because it provides a lower value (545) compared to my outside offer (639).\n   - Walking away and taking my outside offer would give me a value of 639.\n   - I can counteroffer with a proposal that aims to secure at least or more than 639 in value.\n\nConsidering these points, I need to make a counteroffer that gives me as much value as possible, aiming for at least 639. One strategy could involve keeping items with high value to me like item 2.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer:\n- I\u2019ll offer Player 2: [2, 0, 3, 3, 1], which means I keep:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 26 = 52\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 99 = 99\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 58 = 58\n  - 1 unit of item 4: 1 * 68 = 68\n  - 0 units of item 5: 0 * 20 = 0\n  - Total Value = 52 + 99 + 58 + 68 + 0 = 277\n\nClearly, this offer is too low for me. Let's readjust this strategic split:\n- Offer Player 2: [2, 0, 3, 1, 1], resulting in:\n  - I keep: \n    - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 58 = 116\n    - 3 units of item 4: 3 * 68 = 204\n    - Total Value = 99 (item 2) + 116 (2 units item 3) + 204 (3 units item 4) = 419\n\nThis proposal again doesn't surpass 639, but due to the lightweight constraint of keeping round 3 proposition, it seems best to counter again. Let's propose offering him [2, 0, 3, 0, 1], ensuring the following:\n- I keep: [2, 1, 1, 4, 0]\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 * 26 = 52\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 * 99 = 99\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 * 58 = 58\n  - 4 units of item 4: 4 * 68 = 272\n  - Total Value = 52 + 99 + 58 + 272 + 0 = 481\n\nUnfortunately, any allocation scheme doesn't logical reach 639. I'll proceed with more advantageous counteroffers:\n\nOffer scheme [3, 0, 2, 1, 1], while ratcheting better values: \n - I keep: [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]\n   - Based value (52 + 99 + 116 + 204 = 471).\n\nAny current distribution exceeds secure attainment of 639 outside guarantee.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 352. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 486 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

We are currently in round 2, so any future offers will be discounted by gamma.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer from Player 2: [3, 0, 1, 2, 2] means I get:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 35 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n   - Total value of current offer to me = 171 + 0 + 64 + 172 + 102 = 509\n\nSince the discounted value is still compared without affecting this immediate choice (we see only round-end discount effects), and 509 is less than my outside offer of 1234, accepting this offer does not make sense.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would mean getting 509, which is significantly lower than my outside offer (1234). So, mistake 4 would occur if I accepted this.\n   - Walking away is currently my most secure option since my outside offer is guaranteed to provide 1234, which is higher than the value of the current offer.\n   - Counteroffering is an option but considering that we are in round 2 and the current value is far below our outside offer, walking may be more advantageous unless we propose a dramatically better division for ourselves.\n\nTo attempt better maximization, I should counteroffer, suggesting a division that aims for more equitable gain, potentially leveraging high-value items.\n\nReasonable attempt might involve securing more of item 4 due to its high value. Offers like [1, 0, 2, 1, 2] give me two units of item 4:\n\n- My counteroffer: [1, 0, 2, 1, 2] means I get:\n  - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 57 = 285\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 35 = 140\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 64 = 256\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 86 = 430\n  - 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 51 = 204\n\nTotal value = 285 + 140 + 256 + 430 + 204 = 1315, higher than the current offer and above my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should propose this new division with the actions available.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 862. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1167 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The value I receive from any outcome will be multiplied by this discount factor if the negotiation goes to the next round. Thus, waiting may reduce my effective value, making it crucial to weigh the potential decrease against potential gains from negotiating better terms.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer from Player 2.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose a division that provides me with a total value higher than my outside offer value of 804. Ideally, it should also account for maximizing my gain based on item values.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the entire pool of items:\n- 6 units of item 1 \u00d7 85 = 510\n- 7 units of item 2 \u00d7 94 = 658\n- 5 units of item 3 \u00d7 60 = 300\n- 3 units of item 4 \u00d7 56 = 168\n- 5 units of item 5 \u00d7 87 = 435\n- **Total potential value** = 510 + 658 + 300 + 168 + 435 = 2071\n\nNow, to exceed the outside offer value of 804, I'll craft an offer where I keep a majority but still propose a reasonable division for Player 2. Aiming to keep items with higher value per unit for myself optimizes my gain.\n\n### Drafting a Counteroffer:\nTo maximize my value, I'll prioritize keeping more of items 2, 1, and 5, which have the highest values for me. Let's propose:\n- Give 2 units of item 1\n- Give 3 units of item 2\n- Give 3 units of item 3\n- Give 1 unit of item 4\n- Give 2 units of item 5\n\n**Remaining for me:**\n- 4 units of item 1 \u00d7 85 = 340\n- 4 units of item 2 \u00d7 94 = 376\n- 2 units of item 3 \u00d7 60 = 120\n- 2 units of item 4 \u00d7 56 = 112\n- 3 units of item 5 \u00d7 87 = 261\n\n**Total value for me** = 340 + 376 + 120 + 112 + 261 = 1209\n\nThis proposed division offers a value higher than my outside offer of 804, making it a strategic first counteroffer.\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\nBased on the analysis, my first move will be to propose this counteroffer, as it gives me more value than my outside offer, while still providing reasonable terms for Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 924. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 897 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 3, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 924.\n   - The values of the items involved are:\n     - Item 1: 29 per unit\n     - Item 2: 63 per unit\n     - Item 3: 82 per unit\n     - Item 4: 44 per unit\n     - Item 5: 81 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is [6, 7, 5, 3, 5].\n   - The discount factor of 0.9 means that if I go to future rounds, my value outcome will be multiplied by 0.9 if it's in the next round, and 0.81 if it's two rounds later. Therefore, it's important to consider current versus future potential negotiations.\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer:\n   - Current offer from Player 1 to me is [2, 3, 3, 1, 2], meaning they keep [4, 4, 2, 2, 3].\n   - Calculate my value if I accept this offer:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n     - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 44 = 44\n     - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n     - Total value = 58 + 189 + 246 + 44 + 162 = 699\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - Accepting this offer gives me a value of 699, which is less than my outside offer value of 924.\n   - If I counteroffer with all items to myself, this will also not fit within the valid action format.\n   - An optimal counteroffer must be higher in value, so it\u2019s greater than my outside offer value.\n\nGiven that the current offer is less than my outside offer, I need to either make a counteroffer that might invite a higher payout or walk away. However, walking away now would mean immediately taking my outside offer without trying to maximize what I could gain. Considering the game structure, here\u2019s a rational counteroffer attempt:\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 a division where we ensure that we secure at least 924 in value:\n\nIf I keep:\n- 4 of item 1: 4 \u00d7 29 = 116\n- 4 of item 2: 4 \u00d7 63 = 252\n- 3 of item 3: 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n- 1 of item 4: 1 \u00d7 44 = 44\n- 3 of item 5: 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n\nTotal value = 116 + 252 + 164 + 44 + 243 = 819\n\nThis offer still undervalues my outside option slightly. Therefore, I should consider not proposing less than my outside value:\n\nInstead, consider a slightly different breakdown:\nKeep 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5:\n- 2 of item 1: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n- 2 of item 2: 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n- 3 of item 3: 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n- 2 of item 4: 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n- 3 of item 5: 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n\nTotal value = 761\n\nConsidering further tweaking is necessary to ensure greater than 924:\nOffer [4, 4, 2, 0, 3] to Player 1, I receive:\n- 2 of item 1: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n- 3 of item 2: 3 \u00d7 63 = 189\n- 3 of item 3: 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n- 2 of item 4: 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n- 2 of item 5: 2 \u00d7 81 = 162 \n\nTotal value = 743\n\nAny feasible allocation using less than, reiterate counter:\nOffer [2, 2, 1, 1, 2] I'd receive:\n- 4 of item 1 = 4 x 29 = 116\n- 5 of item 2 = 5 x 63 = 315\n- 4 of item 3 = 4 x 82 = 328\n- 2 of item 4 = 2 x 44 = 88\n- 3 of item 5 = 3 x 81 = 243 \n\nOverall sum: 116 + 315 + 328 + 88 + 243 = 1090\nValid over threshold try proposal. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To begin, let's tackle the analysis step by step:\n\n1) Current Situation Analysis:\n   - My outside offer value is 1200.\n   - My private values for the items are as follows:\n     - Item 1: 80\n     - Item 2: 92\n     - Item 3: 8\n     - Item 4: 70\n     - Item 5: 68\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 4 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor of 0.9 affects the value I would get from waiting for a future round rather than accepting or making a deal now. If the deal moves to further rounds, I would need to multiply my potential value by 0.9 to the power of (r-1), where r is the round number.\n\n2) Value Assessment of Offers:\n   Since there is no current offer from Player 2, let's consider what I can propose as a starting counteroffer. I need to ensure the value to me from any proposal I make is higher than 1200, otherwise, it would not be better than walking away with my outside offer.\n\n   Total value of all items if I keep everything (for comparison):\n   - (4 units of item 1 * 80) + (3 units of item 2 * 92) + (3 units of item 3 * 8) + (6 units of item 4 * 70) + (4 units of item 5 * 68)\n   - = 320 + 276 + 24 + 420 + 272\n   - = 1312\n\n   To avoid mistakes:\n   - I can't propose keeping less than 1200 worth of items.\n   - I should aim to retain at least 1200 from my proposals, considering different combinations.\n\n   Let's start with a proposal that keeps most of the valuable items to me, ensuring the retained total is above 1200. Let's try offering most of the lowest valued item (item 3), and some portions of items without highly affecting the accumulated value.\n\n3) Decision Making:\n   \n   A plausible initial offer can be:\n   - Offer Player 2: [2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5].\n   - This will leave me with: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\n   Ensure the value with this division:\n   - 2 units of item 1 * 80 = 160\n   - 1 unit of item 2 * 92 = 92\n   - 0 units of item 3 * 8 = 0\n   - 3 units of item 4 * 70 = 210\n   - 2 units of item 5 * 68 = 136\n\n   Total: 160 + 92 + 0 + 210 + 136 = 598\n   Clearly, this does not meet the necessary criteria as it's below my outside offer of 1200.\n\n   Let's swap to offering less and assess quickly. I need more high-value items:\n   \n   Revised Offer:\n   - Offer Player 2: [0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5].\n   - This leaves me: 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n   \n   Quick Calculation (self-check for 1200):\n   - 4 units of item 1 * 80 = 320\n   - 3 units of item 2 * 92 = 276\n   - 0 units of item 3 * 8 = 0\n   - 5 units of item 4 * 70 = 350\n   - 4 units of item 5 * 68 = 272\n\n   Total: 320 + 276 + 0 + 350 + 272 = 1218, which maintains value > 1200.\n\nThe proposed counteroffer is valid. Thus, the response is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\nSince accepting the current offer is not optimal, I must either walk away or make a counteroffer. Walking away guarantees me a value of 807. To make a counteroffer better for me than my outside offer, the retained item units must generate a value higher than 807. \n\n**Creating a Counteroffer:**\n\nI need to decide on a division where my received value exceeds 807.\n\n- If I propose to receive:\n  - 6 units of Item 1: 6 \u00d7 49 = 294\n  - 4 units of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 46 = 184\n  - 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n  - 4 units of Item 4: 4 \u00d7 18 = 72\n  - 3 units of Item 5: 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n  \n  Total = 294 + 184 + 45 + 72 + 168 = 763, which is still less than 807.\n\nLet's try:\n\n- 7 units of Item 1: 7 \u00d7 49 = 343\n- 5 units of Item 2: 5 \u00d7 46 = 230\n- 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n- 3 units of Item 4: 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n- 3 units of Item 5: 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n\nTotal = 343 + 230 + 45 + 54 + 168 = 840, which is greater than 807.\n\nCounteroffer: [1, 1, 2, 2, 1] to Player 1 (I keep [7, 5, 3, 3, 3]).\n\n### Action\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 2, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 3, 2, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, I'll evaluate the current offer, potential counteroffers, and compare them to my outside offer value of 485.\n\n1. **Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer:** 485\n   - **Values of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 6\n     - Item 2: 47\n     - Item 3: 35\n     - Item 4: 34\n     - Item 5: 67\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** 8 units of item 1, 6 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor:** We're in round 3, so if we agree now the value is not discounted. If we walk, we get the outside offer.\n\n2. **Evaluate Current Offer [3, 1, 2, 2, 0]:**\n   - For me (remaining quantities):\n     - Item 1: 5 units (5 \u00d7 6 = 30)\n     - Item 2: 5 units (5 \u00d7 47 = 235)\n     - Item 3: 3 units (3 \u00d7 35 = 105)\n     - Item 4: 3 units (3 \u00d7 34 = 102)\n     - Item 5: 4 units (4 \u00d7 67 = 268)\n   - Total Value = 740\n\n3. **Compare Values:**\n   - My Value from Current Offer: 740\n   - My Outside Offer: 485\n\nThe current offer provides a total value of 740, which is greater than my outside offer value of 485. Accepting this offer maximizes my outcome in comparison to the outside offer. \n\nGiven that this is the last round, I should aim to take an acceptable offer rather than risk getting no deal. Therefore, I should not walk away because it would be a mistake to walk away from a better offer (Mistake 5).\n\n4. **Decision:**\n\n- The current offer is clearly better than my outside offer.\n- There is no scope for more rounds, as this is the final round.\n\nThus, the most rational decision is to accept the current offer. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Given the values, item 2 and item 1 are most valuable to me, so I will favor retaining more units of them. \n\nLet's try the following division where I keep a high value for myself:\n\nOffer a distribution:\n- Offer 1 units of item 1 to Player 2, I keep 4 units.\n- Offer 2 units of item 2 to Player 2, I keep 5 units.\n- Offer 4 units of item 3 to Player 2, I keep 0 units.\n- Offer 6 units of item 4 to Player 2, I keep 1 unit.\n- Offer 3 units of item 5 to Player 2, I keep 2 units.\n\nMy value with this distribution:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 54 = 216\n- 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 56 = 280\n- 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n- 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n\nTotal value = 216 + 280 + 0 + 6 + 48 = 550\n\nThis distribution provides me with a total value of 550, which is above my outside offer of 445.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I should make a counteroffer with the division calculated above since it maximizes my payoff compared to my outside offer and adheres to the potential strategy for negotiation.\n\nHere is the proposed counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 4, 6, 3]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's go through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 501.\n   - Values of the items to me are:\n     - Item 1: 80\n     - Item 2: 31\n     - Item 3: 98\n     - Item 4: 49\n     - Item 5: 11\n   - The total pool of items:\n     - 2 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 2 units of item 4\n     - 5 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor is 0.9, which influences future rounds. The current value is not discounted because it's still within the second round without having to factor in the 0.9 exponentiation, meaning it works similarly to the first round. \n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n     - Value if accepted:\n       - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 80 = 80\n       - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n       - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 98 = 98\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n       - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n     - Total value = 80 + 31 + 98 + 49 + 22 = 280\n\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** The current offer value of 280 is significantly below my outside offer value of 501. Accepting the current offer would violate Mistake 4, accepting an offer worse than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is less valuable than my outside offer, so I should not accept it.\n   - Walking away guarantees me a value of 501 which is higher than the current offer.\n   - As it is round 2, I have an opportunity to make a counteroffer. I should aim to maximize my value while ensuring the division makes it worthwhile for Player 1 to consider the offer.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while being reasonable to see if it could entice Player 1 to accept it in the final round:\n\n- **Propose Counteroffer**: Offer all of item 5 and part of some other low-value items to Player 1.\n  - Giving: [0, 2, 0, 1, 5] makes me receive [2, 1, 2, 1, 0]\n  - My value calculation:\n    - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n    - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 98 = 196\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n    - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n  - Total value = 160 + 31 + 196 + 49 = 436, which is below the outside offer value.\n\nThe counter should be designed to go for a higher value gain without reducing what Player 1 might accept. However, all attempts prior yield below 501, so these counteroffers tempted do not exceed the outside offer satisfactorily at this step.\n\nFinal conclusion depends on this analysis and how I prioritize the unknown willingness of Player 1 and negotiation strategy. At this stage:\n- Any counteroffer below 501 does not strategically add valuable weight, while risking a misstep. Thus,\n- Secure the outside offer value.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

                    "response": "To determine my action, let's follow the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 879.\n   - Values of the items for me are:\n     - Item 1: 60\n     - Item 2: 24\n     - Item 3: 91\n     - Item 4: 29\n     - Item 5: 48\n   - Total pool of items available to divide:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, which affects value over rounds. Since this is round 1, the discount does not apply yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Calculate my value of all items: \n     - \\(4 \\times 60 + 2 \\times 24 + 4 \\times 91 + 6 \\times 29 + 3 \\times 48 = 240 + 48 + 364 + 174 + 144 = 970\\)\n   - My outside offer is 879, which means I need an alternative that values higher than this.\n   - Let's consider potential divisions that give me a value greater than 879.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - I will make an initial offer to Player 2 where I retain the majority of the high-value items. I aim to keep my offer attractive enough while securing a value exceeding my outside offer.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer:\n- I will offer Player 2:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 (worth 60 * 1 = 60)\n  - 1 unit of item 2 (worth 24 * 1 = 24)\n  - 1 unit of item 3 (worth 91 * 1 = 91)\n  - 3 units of item 4 (worth 29 * 3 = 87)\n  - 1 unit of item 5 (worth 48 * 1 = 48)\n  \nThe remaining value to me:\n- 3 units of item 1 (value: 180)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (value: 24)\n- 3 units of item 3 (value: 273)\n- 3 units of item 4 (value: 87)\n- 2 units of item 5 (value: 96)\n\nTotal value to me: \\(180 + 24 + 273 + 87 + 96 = 660\\)\n\nThis counteroffer leaves me with a value of 660, which is less than my outside offer (879). Thus, this offer isn't acceptable.\n\nAdjusting the offer to aim for a value exceeding 879, I'll reconsider how much to offer:\n\nI'll adjust to:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n  \nThe value of units offered:\n- 0 units of item 1 (worth 0)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (worth 24)\n- 0 units of item 3 (worth 0)\n- 3 units of item 4 (worth 87)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (worth 48)\nTotal: 159\n\nValue of remaining items:\n- 4 units of item 1 (value: 240)\n- 1 unit of item 2 (value: 24)\n- 4 units of item 3 (value: 364)\n- 3 units of item 4 (value: 87)\n- 2 units of item 5 (value: 96)\n\nNew total value to me: \\(240 + 24 + 364 + 87 + 96 = 811\\)\n\nNote that despite adjustments, this still is less than my outside offer. Counteroffer needs a strategy to reach a value over 879. Since restricting more doesn't help, and the discount value for subsequent rounds significantly effects negotiation, this attempt at altering to reach a comparative value is hard to project.\n\nGiven the above results and constraints, let's decide based on recurring protocol optimization strategies:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

It's a strong opening offer that keeps a significant majority of the items. It avoids giving away any high-value items entirely, preserving strong value while leaving some room for negotiation.\n\nConsidering the analysis, I will choose to make the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I'll walk through the step-by-step analysis and calculation process.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is **328**.\n   - The values of the items for me are:\n     - Item 1: 1\n     - Item 2: 20\n     - Item 3: 37\n     - Item 4: 38\n     - Item 5: 86\n   - Total pool of items to divide:\n     - 7 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 2 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the decision as it depreciates the present value of future offers by a factor of 0.9 for each round that passes.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   As the first player, I need to make an initial offer. I will calculate the value I receive from keeping a share of the items to see if a counteroffer is better than my outside offer.\n\n   - If I propose offering 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2, I'll keep:\n     - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n   - Total value I keep: 3 + 20 + 37 + 76 + 86 = **222**\n\n   Since 222 is less than my outside offer of 328, this counteroffer does not work. I will aim for a higher value for myself, without committing mistakes like offering all or no items.\n\n3) **Propose a specific counteroffer:**\n\n   I'll adjust my strategy to maximize my value close to, or above my outside offer of 328 while leaving a reasonable share to Player 2 for negotiations to be promising.\n\n   I'll try this division:\n   - 5 units of item 1 to Player 2, keeping 2 for myself\n   - 0 units of item 2 to Player 2, keeping 1 for myself\n   - 1 unit of item 3 to Player 2, keeping 1 for myself\n   - 2 units of item 4 to Player 2, keeping 2 for myself\n   - 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2, keeping 1 for myself\n\n   - My retained values will be calculated as follows:\n     - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n   - Total value I retain: 2 + 20 + 37 + 76 + 86 = **221**\n\n   I still need more value. I will instead correct my offer to match or exceed 328, the value of my outside offer.\n\nAdjusting further:\n\n   - 3 units of item 1 to Player 2, keeping 4\n   - 0 units of item 2 to Player 2, keeping 1\n   - 1 unit of item 3 to Player 2, keeping 1\n   - 2 units of item 4 to Player 2, keeping 2\n   - 0 units of item 5 to Player 2, keeping 2\n\n   Calculating my retained value:\n   - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 1 = 4\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n   - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 37 = 37\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n\n   Total value I retain = 4 + 20 + 37 + 76 + 172 = **309**\n\nActually, I still need to refine this further to adequately surpass 328, my fallback position. I need to adjust further:\n\n   - 5 units of item 1 to Player 2, keeping 2\n   - 0 units of item 2 to Player 2, keeping 1\n   - 0 units of item 3 to Player 2, keeping 2\n   - 1 units of item 4 to Player 2, keeping 3\n   - 0 units of item 5 to Player 2, keeping 2\n\nCalculating one more time:\n\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n   - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 37 = 74\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 38 = 114\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n     \nTotal value retained: 2 + 20 + 74 + 114 + 172 = **382**\n\nThis achieves a value greater than my fallback, therefore the counteroffer to propose would be:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 0, 0, 1, 0]}",

                    "response": "To make a proper decision, let's evaluate the current offer and compare it to my outside offer:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is **1022**.\n   - Values of items:\n     - Item 1: 36\n     - Item 2: 95\n     - Item 3: 50\n     - Item 4: 94\n     - Item 5: 76\n   - Total pool of items: [2, 5, 3, 2, 6]\n   - Discount factor influences value by reducing the value of a delayed outcome. In round 1, no discount is applied.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** [2, 0, 2, 1, 0] (my allocation from this offer)\n     - Total pool minus current offer: [0, 5, 1, 1, 6] for Player 1.\n     - My total value for current offer:\n       - Item 1: 2 * 36 = 72\n       - Item 2: 0 * 95 = 0\n       - Item 3: 2 * 50 = 100\n       - Item 4: 1 * 94 = 94\n       - Item 5: 0 * 76 = 0\n     - Total value of current offer to me = 72 + 0 + 100 + 94 + 0 = **266**\n\n   - **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n     - Current offer value is 266, which is much lower than my outside offer of 1022.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me a value of 266, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 1022. According to mistake #4, I must avoid accepting an offer that is worse than my outside offer.\n   - Making a counteroffer that gives me a total value more than 1022, considering the full value of the items I have (present and potential), might be wise. The challenge is ensuring Player 1 accepts this.\n   - Walking away ensures my fallback position of 1022, which is preferable if Player 1 is not amenable to my counteroffer.\n\nGiven the situation, it is clear that the current offer is unacceptable because it is worse than my outside offer. To aim for a better division, I will consider changes that maximize my value beyond 1022. If subsequent rounds allow negotiation, I might work towards this. However, in this immediate context, if a counteroffer with high value is not viable, I should secure my outside offer which is more favorable.\n\nTherefore, based on the evaluation, if making an optimal counteroffer is not feasible instantly, the prudent action is just to secure the fallback:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 894. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 894 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Given that we're in round 1, there's no discount factor applied yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer (what's offered to me): [3, 2, 1, 2, 0]**\n     - Value of 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 87 = 261\n     - Value of 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 55 = 110\n     - Value of 1 unit of item 3 = 1 * 85 = 85\n     - Value of 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 9 = 18\n     - Value of 0 units of item 5 = 0 * 62 = 0\n     - **Total value = 261 + 110 + 85 + 18 + 0 = 474**\n     \n   - **Comparison with outside offer:**\n     - My outside value is 894, which is greater than the 474 value from accepting the current offer.\n  \n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - **Should I accept the current offer?**\n     - No, because it offers significantly less value (474) than my outside offer of 894.\n   - **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n     - Potentially, but first, let's consider a counteroffer.\n   - **Propose a specific counteroffer:**\n     - I need to ensure that the counteroffer keeps my value above my outside offer, or it won't be beneficial. Let's attempt a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a bit more while ensuring high value for me.\n\nTo keep a high value for myself, I should aim to retain high-value items like item 1 and item 3, while I could give more of items 4 and 5 since their value is lower to me. Here is a calculated and balanced approach: \n\n**Counteroffer:**\n- Giving Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 3, 2] (which means I keep: [3, 2, 2, 2, 1])\n\nCalculation of my value for this counteroffer:\n- Value of 3 units of item 1 = 3 * 87 = 261\n- Value of 2 units of item 2 = 2 * 55 = 110\n- Value of 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 85 = 170\n- Value of 2 units of item 4 = 2 * 9 = 18\n- Value of 1 unit of item 5 = 1 * 62 = 62\n- **Total value = 261 + 110 + 170 + 18 + 62 = 621**, which is still below my outside offer, but potentially superior in future discounted offers.\n\nGiven the gamma factor will apply in subsequent rounds, a slight adjustment is necessary.\n\nLet's propose a more strategic counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 4, 2]}",

If I choose to give Player 1: \n     - [1, 0, 0, 3, 3], I receive: [3, 3, 2, 2, 0].\n     - Value calculation for me:\n       - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 85 = 170\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 62 = 0\n       - Total value = 261 + 165 + 170 + 18 + 0 = 614. This is still less than my outside offer.\n\nTo avoid making a suboptimal move and considering I cannot get a better current offer than my outside offer, my best decision is not to make a counteroffer with less value and instead guarantee my higher fallback.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

I may need to alter the offer minimally or offer fewer items to the opponent to increase my retained value.\n\nAdjust and balance the offer:\n- Offer fewer higher valued items.\n\nLet's make a more assertive offer:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units from Item 1 \n  - 1 unit from Item 2\n  - 1 unit from Item 3\n  - 1 unit from Item 4\n  - 1 unit from Item 5\n\nCalculating the retained value:\n- Retaining 6 units of Item 1: 6 * 60 = 360\n- Retaining 2 units of Item 2: 2 * 53 = 106\n- Retaining 3 units of Item 3: 3 * 95 = 285\n- Retaining 1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 6 = 6\n- Retaining 3 units of Item 5: 3 * 53 = 159\n- Total retained value: 360 + 106 + 285 + 6 + 159 = 916\n\nThis offer does not yet exceed my outside offer value when discounted through rounds. To ensure my retained value exceeds 1054, let's keep these adjustments:\n\nFinal offer:\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 0 units from Item 1 \n  - 0 units from Item 2\n  - 1 unit from Item 3\n  - 1 unit from Item 4\n  - 0 units from Item 5\n\nCalculating the retained value:\n- Retaining 6 units of Item 1: 6 * 60 = 360\n- Retaining 3 units of Item 2: 3 * 53 = 159\n- Retaining 3 units of Item 3: 3 * 95 = 285\n- Retaining 1 unit of Item 4: 1 * 6 = 6\n- Retaining 4 units of Item 5: 4 * 53 = 212\n- Total retained value: 360 + 159 + 285 + 6 + 212 = 1022\n\nThis offer allows for negotiation flexibility in subsequent rounds while maximizing my value.\n\nLet's make the final counteroffer action:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

However, quantities could be adjusted to still propose.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer which provides me a bit more leverage:\n\nLet's create a higher value:\n- Avoid touching on high-value item 3 entirely for me, but propose a bit more elsewhere.\n\n**Let's re-adjust: [2, 0, 0, 0, 4]**\n- Leaves with:\n  - Item 1: 4 units = 240\n  - Item 2: 3 units = 159\n  - Item 3: 4 units = 380\n  - Item 4: 2 units = 12\n  - Item 5: 0 units = 0\n- Total Value: 791 \u00d7 0.9 (round 2 discount) = 711.9\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer. If it were round 3, another counteroffer would be risky, so another iteration should try to reach it optimally.\n\nGiven the complexity, the calculated reach isn't yet exceeding:\n\nUltimately, a likely strategy rounds around preserving complete high value minimally enough with \u201chere try this\u201d framework:\n\nBut seeing we exceed outside driven considerations better give config focus per round flexibility grasp bettering full utility.\n\nAfter considering these options and recalculating offer scenarios logically, here\u2019s:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n\n---\n\nHowever, walking away at current present better foreseeable means before next counter strike (but presentation reason holds decisions stated counterintuitive nuance rather than purely optimal).",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 30. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

I need to keep more valuable items.\n\nTo make an offer that provides a high enough value, let's revise my offer:\n\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 1 (keeping 3 units for ourselves)\n- Offer 0 units of Item 2 (keeping 2 units for ourselves)\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 3 (keeping 2 units for ourselves)\n- Offer 0 units of Item 4 (keeping 1 unit for ourselves)\n- Offer 0 units of Item 5 (keeping 1 unit for ourselves)\n\nCalculating again:\n- Kept 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n- Kept 2 units of Item 2: 2 \u00d7 94 = 188\n- Kept 2 units of Item 3: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n- Kept 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n- Kept 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n\nTotal value for me = 171 + 188 + 124 + 25 + 96 = 604\n\nEven this offer is not high enough, but we might need to risk getting as close to the outside offer as possible (going below is not optimal but may lead to better offers from Player 2). \n\nRevising again, using another balance:\n\n- Offer 1 unit of Item 2 (keeping 1 unit for ourselves for more value).\n  \n- Kept 3 units of Item 1: 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n- Kept 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n- Kept 2 units of Item 3: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n- Kept 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n- Kept 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 96 = 96\n\nTotal value for me = 171 + 94 + 124 + 25 + 96 = 510\n\nThus, given our setups of units that lead to a calculative offer maybe only slightly improved, my best approach is adjusting these perceptions, ultimately focusing on leveraging key items. \n\nHence, positioning optimally and attracting counter-negotiation maneuvers here, a slightly soft offer is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]}\n```\nI offer Player 2: 1 unit of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of Item 3, and none of Item 4 and 5. The rest I keep, banking potential future resolution improvement factor (in terms of units' carrying strategic allocation) or more attractive engagement response from Player 2.",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - **My Outside Offer Value:** 470\n   - **Values of Items Involved:**\n     - Item 1: 81 per unit \n     - Item 2: 45 per unit \n     - Item 3: 38 per unit \n     - Item 4: 32 per unit \n     - Item 5: 44 per unit \n   - **Total Pool of Items:** \n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 1 unit of item 5\n   - **Discount Factor Influence:** \n     - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) has not come into play for calculations if the negotiation doesn't extend to the next rounds since we are evaluating end-of-round outcomes in round 2.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Value of Current Offer: [1, 2, 1, 1, 0] (items to me):**\n     - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 81 = 81\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n     - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n     - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 44 = 0\n     - Total value = 81 + 90 + 38 + 32 + 0 = 241\n\n   The value of the current offer, 241, is significantly less than my outside offer value of 470. \n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n\n   - **Accept the Current Offer?** \n     - The current offer gives me a total value of 241, which is much lower than my outside offer of 470. Accepting this would be mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse for me than my outside offer).\n     \n   - **Walk Away?**\n     - Walking away guarantees me 470, more than the offer on the table.\n   \n   - **Propose a Counteroffer?**\n     - I should consider a counteroffer that could potentially be more aligned with my outside offer. I'll propose a counteroffer and calculate its value to ensure its viability.\n\n   **Potential Counteroffer Calculation:**\n   - Consider offering Player 1: [2, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n   - This means I would receive the following:\n     - Player 2 receives (not offered to Player 1):\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 81 = 162\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n       - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 44 = 44\n     - Total calculated value = 162 + 90 + 76 + 32 + 44 = 404\n\n   The value of my proposed division (404) is lower than my outside offer (470), which makes rejecting the current offer still preferable to this proposed offer. Therefore, a different attempt is needed. I should consider walking away, ensuring I don't make mistake 5 (walking away from a better offer than getting nothing). However, if I can manage a different offer to increase the benefit, it would be wise.\n\nGiven the potential that a better counteroffer might not materialize, and keeping in mind the rule that this proposal, if lower than my outside offer, wouldn't be beneficial; from what's been examined, walking to secure at least value of 470 seems strategically sound.\n\nTaking all factors into consideration, including ensuring here is no mistake in proposal:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's break down the current situation based on the steps:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 258.\n   - **Values of the items involved:** \n     - Item 1: 48\n     - Item 2: 28\n     - Item 3: 45\n     - Item 4: 35\n     - Item 5: 28\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - Item 1: 3 units\n     - Item 2: 4 units\n     - Item 3: 1 unit\n     - Item 4: 6 units\n     - Item 5: 4 units\n   - **Discount factor:** The discount factor is 0.9 per round. Since we are in round 1, it doesn\u2019t affect our value yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer from Player 1:** [1, 2, 0, 3, 2]\n     - My share of the items will be: \n       - Item 1: 2 units (worth 2 * 48 = 96)\n       - Item 2: 2 units (worth 2 * 28 = 56)\n       - Item 3: 1 unit (worth 1 * 45 = 45)\n       - Item 4: 3 units (worth 3 * 35 = 105)\n       - Item 5: 2 units (worth 2 * 28 = 56)\n     - Total value = 96 + 56 + 45 + 105 + 56 = 358\n\n   - **Compare to outside offer:** 358 is greater than my outside offer of 258.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer from Player 1 gives me a value of 358, which is higher than my outside offer of 258. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of losing value in future rounds due to discounting and secures a higher value than my guaranteed fallback.\n\nTherefore, accepting the current offer is a good decision. \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
