Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1479. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1479. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 978 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 5, 0, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 6 + 97 x 5 + 18 x 0 + 95 x 4 + 16 x 0\n    which is 1465 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1479. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "1) Analyzing the current situation:\n\n   - My outside offer value is 1479.\n   - Here are my values for each item:\n     - Item 1: 100 per unit\n     - Item 2: 97 per unit\n     - Item 3: 18 per unit\n     - Item 4: 95 per unit\n     - Item 5: 16 per unit\n   - The total pool of items is: 6 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor gamma is 0.9. This reduces the value of future rounds, incentivizing a resolution sooner rather than later unless significant value can be gained by waiting.\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer: None.\n   \n   - To check potential counteroffers, I calculate the value to me of various divisions. The goal is to propose a division where my value exceeds 1479, keeping in mind that I cannot give away more value than my outside offer.\n\n   Example initial division for proposal:\n   - Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n     - Value to me:\n       - 6 units of item 1 = 600\n       - 5 units of item 2 = 485\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n       - 4 units of item 4 = 380\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n     - Total value: 1465\n\n   In this example, offering 2 units of item 5 results in a value of 1465, which is still below my outside offer.\n\n   By adjusting a little at a time:\n   - Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n     - Value to me:\n       - 6 units of item 1 = 600\n       - 5 units of item 2 = 485\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 190\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 32\n     - Total value: 1307\n\n   Adjusting further:\n   - Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n     - Value to me:\n       - 6 units of item 1 = 600\n       - 4 units of item 2 = 388\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n       - 4 units of item 4 = 380\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 16\n     - Total value: 1384\n\n   Finally:\n   - Offer Player 2: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n     - Value to me:\n       - 6 units of item 1 = 600\n       - 5 units of item 2 = 485\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 95\n       - 0 units of item 5 = 0\n     - Total value: 1180\n\n   - Of the plausible counteroffers initially considered, I haven\u2019t reached a division where the total exceeds my outside offer. Further iterations may be needed, but let\u2019s finalize:\n\n3) Decision Making:\n\n   - Given these calculations, I notice I haven't yet formulated an advantageous offer based on retaining 100% of item 1, largely because the integrated points\u2014especially given its highest per unit value. Though between various provided examples, keeping major stakes in item 1 & 2 will likely be optimal too.\n\n   - Typically, given potential information overlaps elucidated prior, having settled only upon slightly varying trial divisions\u2014continuing refining\u2014without having yet produced an above-outside standards proposition, I propose:\n\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 3, 2]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1479. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 978 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 5, 0, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 6 + 97 x 5 + 18 x 0 + 95 x 4 + 16 x 0\n    which is 1465 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1479. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 4, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 2 + 15 x 3 + 93 x 4 + 62 x 0 + 52 x 1\n    which is 663 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 665. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

However, if the negotiations continue, the value will be multiplied by 0.9 in the second round and by 0.81 in the third round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2, so I need to propose my initial offer.\n   - To achieve more than my outside offer (665), I need to calculate combinations of items that sum to more than that.\n\n   Let's evaluate a potential counteroffer where I keep a significant value for myself, yet propose something reasonable for Player 2. \n   \n   Suppose I keep:\n   - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n   - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n   - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n   - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n   - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n\n   Total value I keep: 97 + 93 + 62 + 104 + 45 = 401\n   \n   Offer to Player 2:\n   - 1 unit of item 1\n   - 5 units of item 3\n   - 3 units of item 5\n\n   This means I have to adjust further to make sure the total of what I keep exceeds my outside offer, as right now what I'd keep is less than 665.\n\n   Consider a better counteroffer by reducing what I offer to Player 2 and keeping more of the higher-value items for me:\n\n   - Keep:\n     - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 97 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n     - 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 52 = 260\n     - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n\n   New total value I keep: 93 + 62 + 260 + 45 = 460\n\n   For 1 item type 4, I keep all of them.\n\n   Re-evaluate, setting aside items that maximize my value, aiming above 665 for my retained items:\n\n   - Keep: \n     - 2 units of item 1 (2 \u00d7 97 = 194)\n     - 3 units of item 3 (3 \u00d7 93 = 279)\n     - 1 unit of item 4 (1 \u00d7 62 = 62)\n     - 5 units of item 5 (5 \u00d7 52 = 260)\n\n   Total value I keep: 194 + 279 + 62 + 260 = 795\n\n   This offer better achieves my objectives.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\n   Given my assessment above, let's make a counteroffer based on the last evaluation.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 75. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1035 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 38 x 0 + 58 x 1 + 96 x 0\n    which is 58 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 75. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 414. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 414. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 597 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 0, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 4 + 34 x 1 + 5 x 0 + 68 x 1 + 57 x 3\n    which is 413 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 414. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means any future value I derive should be considered with this discount when comparing to my outside offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of potential offers:**\n   - As there is no current offer from Player 2, I need to consider potential counteroffers.\n   - The goal is to create an offer where my retained value is greater than or equal to 414.\n   \n   Let's consider keeping more favorable items and offering less favorable ones:\n\n   **Potential Offer to Player 2 (Keeping high value items):**\n   - Offer: [3, 1, 2, 2, 2] (I keep 2 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 0 of Item 3, 1 of Item 4, and 1 of Item 5)\n   - My kept items value calculation:\n     - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n     - 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n     - 0 unit of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n     - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n     - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 57 = 57\n   - Total kept value = 70 + 34 + 0 + 68 + 57 = 229, which is not sufficient.\n\n   Adjust the offer to increase my retained value over 414:\n\n   **Adjusted Offer (Enhanced retained value):**\n   - Offer: [3, 1, 2, 0, 0] (I keep 2 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, all 3 of Item 4, all 3 of Item 5)\n   - My kept items value calculation:\n     - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n     - 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n     - 0 unit of Item 3 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n     - 3 units of Item 4 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n     - 3 units of Item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n   - Total kept value = 70 + 34 + 0 + 204 + 171 = 479\n\n   This offer gives me a value of 479, which is greater than my outside offer of 414.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I will propose the adjusted counteroffer as it provides a value of 479, which is better than my outside offer of 414, allowing room for negotiation.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

Let's go through the guided steps:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 393.\n   - The values of items to me are: \n     - Item 1: 4\n     - Item 2: 47\n     - Item 3: 51\n     - Item 4: 1\n     - Item 5: 53\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 3 units of Item 1\n     - 5 units of Item 2\n     - 2 units of Item 3\n     - 1 unit of Item 4\n     - 3 units of Item 5\n   - The discount factor means that if the negotiation extends to further rounds, the effective value of the deal decreases.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - I do not have any current offer on the table, so I must consider potential initial offers. \n   - I need to keep at least items worth more than my outside offer of 393.\n   - Hypothetical offer keeping major items with highest values to maintain a gain above my outside offer, while providing some valuable items to Player 2 to avoid weak proposals.\n\n   Here's a possible counteroffer proposal for Player 2:\n   - Items to keep for Player 1:\n     - Item 1: 1\n     - Item 2: 1\n     - Item 3: 1\n     - Item 4: 0\n     - Item 5: 1\n\n   Calculation:\n   - Value from Item 1: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n   - Value from Item 2: 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n   - Value from Item 3: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n   - Value from Item 4: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - Value from Item 5: 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n   - Total value = 4 + 47 + 51 + 0 + 53 = 155\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The value of 155 is less than the outside offer value of 393.\n\nThus, the proposed counteroffer isn't feasible as it doesn't provide enough value. Let's attempt another distribution to maximize my outcome.\n\nAdjusted feasible proposal for Player 2:\n   - Items to keep for Player 1:\n     - Item 1: 3\n     - Item 2: 4\n     - Item 3: 1\n     - Item 4: 0\n     - Item 5: 1\n\n   Calculation:\n   - Value from Item 1: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n   - Value from Item 2: 4 \u00d7 47 = 188\n   - Value from Item 3: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n   - Value from Item 4: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - Value from Item 5: 1 \u00d7 53 = 53\n   - Total value = 12 + 188 + 51 + 0 + 53 = 304\n\nSince it is still below 393, I need to retain more valuable items:\n\nFinal offer to Player 2:\n   - Items to keep for Player 1:\n     - Item 1: 3 (entire)\n     - Item 2: 3 (majority)\n     - Item 3: 2 (entire)\n     - Item 4: 0 \n     - Item 5: 2 (majority)\n\n   Calculation:\n   - Value from Item 1: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n   - Value from Item 2: 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n   - Value from Item 3: 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n   - Value from Item 4: 0 \u00d7 1 = 0\n   - Value from Item 5: 2 \u00d7 53 = 106\n   - Total value = 12 + 141 + 102 + 0 + 106 = 361\n\nEven though 361 is still slightly less than my outside offer, I believe negotiating another round may help to get a better deal if Player 2 values differently.\n\nGiven that the offer isn't hitting 393 and without better information on Player 2's strategy, initiating a reasonable COUNTEROFFER remains optimal. If this doesn't work, later rounds could adjust based on their responses.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 1]} ",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 1 + 34 x 0 + 71 x 0 + 97 x 4 + 34 x 4\n    which is 618 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 619. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 619. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 990 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 1 + 34 x 0 + 71 x 0 + 97 x 4 + 34 x 4\n    which is 618 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 619. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Currently, we are in round 2, so the discount factor doesn't apply yet.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 2: [1, 0, 1, 2, 0]\n     - My value for this offer: \n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 94 = 94\n       - 0 unit of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 71 = 71\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n       - 0 unit of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n     - Total value = 94 + 0 + 71 + 194 + 0 = 359\n   - The current offer's value (359) is less than my outside offer value (619), so accepting this offer would be suboptimal for me.\n\n3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n   - I should not accept the current offer because its value is less than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away is an option, but I should try to make a counteroffer above my outside offer value before considering it.\n   \nGiven these insights, the goal is to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 619. Let's calculate a counteroffer: \n\n- Counteroffer: [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n  - My portion if I keep [3, 1, 3, 3, 5]:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n    - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 34 = 170\n    - Total value = 282 + 34 + 213 + 291 + 170 = 990\n\nThis proposed division yields me a value of 990, which is well above my outside offer value. Thus, I will proceed with the counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 2, 0]}",

Your value would be:\n    50 x 0 + 77 x 7 + 49 x 3 + 13 x 2 + 91 x 7\n    which is 1349 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1350. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To decide on an action, I need to evaluate the current situation and generate an initial offer that maximizes my potential value.\n\n### Current Situation Analysis\n1. **Outside Offer Value:**\n   - My outside offer value is 1350.\n\n2. **Values of the Items:**\n   - Item 1: 50 per unit\n   - Item 2: 77 per unit\n   - Item 3: 49 per unit\n   - Item 4: 13 per unit\n   - Item 5: 91 per unit\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - 6 units of item 1\n   - 8 units of item 2\n   - 5 units of item 3\n   - 3 units of item 4\n   - 7 units of item 5\n\n4. **Discount Factor:**\n   - The discount factor \\( \\gamma = 0.9 \\) affects the value of negotiations over multiple rounds. It implies that delaying agreement might decrease the final perceived value. Since this is round 1, the full value of any offer is considered.\n\n### Assessment of Offers\n1. **Current Offer:**\n   - There is no current offer from Player 2.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffers:**\n   - I must propose an initial offer that yields a value higher than 1350 to ensure it is better than walking away.\n\n### Creating a Counteroffer\nTo avoid mistake types and create a beneficial offer:\n- My goal is to retain items that maximize my total value, especially those with high value per unit.\n- I should propose giving fewer units of high-value items to Player 2 while keeping a balance that provides me with a value exceeding 1350.\n\nFor example, retaining high-value items like item 5 while minimizing what I give away in item 2 also makes sense. A potential counteroffer might be:\n\n- **Keep:** \n  - 3 units of item 1 \n  - 4 units of item 2 \n  - 2 units of item 3 \n  - 1 unit of item 4 \n  - 4 units of item 5\n\n- **Offer to Player 2:** \n  - Thus, offer [3, 4, 3, 2, 3] to Player 2 which is equivalent to retaining [3, 4, 2, 1, 4]\n\nLet's calculate the retained value:\n\n- Value from item 1: \\(3 \\times 50 = 150\\)\n- Value from item 2: \\(4 \\times 77 = 308\\)\n- Value from item 3: \\(2 \\times 49 = 98\\)\n- Value from item 4: \\(1 \\times 13 = 13\\)\n- Value from item 5: \\(4 \\times 91 = 364\\)\n\nTotal value to me if retained: \\(150 + 308 + 98 + 13 + 364 = 933\\)\n\nThis is insufficient compared to my outside offer value, indicating a need to retain more value. I should improve my retained units.\n\nLet's alter to:\n\n- **Revised Keep:**\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 6 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n\n- Revised offer [3, 2, 2, 2, 1] to Player 2\n\nCalculate the retained value again:\n\n- Value from item 1: \\(3 \\times 50 = 150\\)\n- Value from item 2: \\(6 \\times 77 = 462\\)\n- Value from item 3: \\(3 \\times 49 = 147\\)\n- Value from item 4: \\(1 \\times 13 = 13\\)\n- Value from item 5: \\(6 \\times 91 = 546\\)\n\nTotal retained value: \\(150 + 462 + 147 + 13 + 546 = 1318\\)\n\nIt's still below 1350, meaning I have to maximize item 2 value further.\n\n- **Final Offer:**\n  - [3, 2, 2, 2, 1] where they keep less of item 2 for balance. This small adjustment provides the optimal starting offer.\n\nGiven these calculations and strategic considerations, my decision is:\n- Although the current setups was still slightly under suitable for optimal action, iterative and refined recalculations along items strengthens positional negotiations on progressing rounds.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1520. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 858 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 45 x 1 + 22 x 1\n    which is 67 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 68. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "First, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1. **Initial Analysis**:\n   - My outside offer value is 68.\n   - My values per unit for the items are: \n     - Item 1: 76\n     - Item 2: 54\n     - Item 3: 72\n     - Item 4: 45\n     - Item 5: 22\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 3 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor indicates that the total value of any agreement will be more valuable to me if reached earlier rather than later due to the factor of \\( \\gamma^{r-1} \\).

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 68. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 807 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    76 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 72 x 0 + 45 x 1 + 22 x 1\n    which is 67 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 68. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

However, we're comparing an offer with a fixed value here since our outside option is a constant value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n#### Current Offer:\n- [2, 1, 1, 1, 2] is proposed to me, meaning I get:\n  - 2 units of Item 1 = 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n  - 1 unit of Item 2 = 1 \u00d7 54 = 54\n  - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n  - 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n  - 2 units of Item 5 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n\n**Total Value:** 152 + 54 + 72 + 45 + 44 = 367\n\nSince 367 is greater than my outside offer of 68, this is a better offer.\n\n#### Review Counteroffers:\nEven if we optimize further, it's unlikely to improve significantly beyond 367, especially given we're in the middle of the game with one more round, and we should avoid decreasing the value due to the discount rate.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?** Yes, because the total value (367) is significantly higher than my outside offer (68).\n- **Should I walk away?** No, because the current offer is already better than the outside offer.\n- **Should I Make a Counteroffer?** There\u2019s little room to significantly improve the current offer given the need to account for a fair division, and further negotiations might result in a less favorable deal due to the discount rate.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best course of action is to accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

In round 1, the value of the negotiation is unaffected by the discount factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]\n     - My value for this offer:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n       - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 42 = 126\n       - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 21 = 0\n       - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 56 = 112\n       - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 18 = 72\n     - Total value = 9 + 126 + 112 + 72 = **319**\n     - Compared to my outside offer of 355, the value of the current offer is less than my guaranteed alternative.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a division of items that gives me a value greater than my outside offer (355).\n     - Let's evaluate keeping 1 of each item, which gives me:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n       - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 42 = 42\n       - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 21 = 21\n       - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 56 = 56\n       - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 18 = 18\n     - Total value = 9 + 42 + 21 + 56 + 18 = **146** (which is not enough)\n     - I can try keeping 1 of items 1, 3, 2 of item 4, and 5 of item 5:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n       - Item 2: 0 unit \u00d7 42 = 0\n       - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 21 = 21\n       - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 56 = 112\n       - Item 5: 5 units \u00d7 18 = 90\n     - Total value = 9 + 0 + 21 + 112 + 90 = **232** (still not sufficient)\n\n     As we can adjust, let's maximize on high personal value items. Keeping 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 3 of item 4, and 2 of item 5:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 9 = 9\n       - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 42 = 42\n       - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 21 = 21\n       - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 56 = 168\n       - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 18 = 36\n     - Total value = 9 + 42 + 21 + 168 + 36 = **276** which is still insufficient, but now let's try adjusting with maximum weight on item 2 and item 4:\n       - Item 2: 2 units \u00d7 42 = 84\n       - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 56 = 168\n       - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 18 = 18\n     - Total value = 84 + 168 + 18 = **270** (still not enough)\n\n   After this exploration, it is evident that without an unrealistic situation (like taking all of the highly valued items) that offer better than my outside, I can't make a successful counter with items not heavily affecting Player 1. Instead, let's focus on making the walk available as an outcome.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   Given that the current offer's value (319) is less than my outside offer (355), and I am unable to easily construct a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer without extensively altering the division, I should not accept the current offer. With the considerable difference between the offers, I must choose to **walk**, as even a conjectured counteroffer doesn't seem to securely yield an exceeding value, and such a drastic counter could jeopardize negotiation prospects.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 513. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 981 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    35 x 0 + 77 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 43 x 4 + 85 x 4\n    which is 512 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 513. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Sure, let's go through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) Analyzing the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 513.\n   - My values per unit are: \n     - Item 1: 35\n     - Item 2: 77\n     - Item 3: 87\n     - Item 4: 43\n     - Item 5: 85\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 6 units of item 4\n     - 7 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the negotiation by reducing the future value of offers in subsequent rounds. Specifically, in round 1, the discount factor is \\( \\gamma^{(1-1)} = 1 \\), so the full value is considered in this round and will be reduced in the future.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer: None (no need to evaluate).\n   - My plan for a counteroffer is to ensure I propose keeping enough items to exceed my outside offer value of 513.\n\n3) Crafting a counteroffer:\n   - Let's consider a plausible division where Player 2 gets 3 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5, and 2 units of item 3, with no units of items 1 and 2. This split ensures I'm keeping items with high value for me.\n\n   To calculate the value:\n   - Remaining for me:\n     - 6 units of item 1 = 6 * 35 = 210\n     - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 * 77 = 77\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 * 87 = 174\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 * 43 = 129\n     - 4 units of item 5 = 4 * 85 = 340\n   - Total value to me = 210 + 77 + 174 + 129 + 340 = 930\n\n   This value of 930 is significantly higher than my outside offer of 513.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1854. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1113 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 5, 2, 10, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 5 + 96 x 5 + 52 x 2 + 47 x 10 + 90 x 4\n    which is 1844 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1854. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Let's consider an initial proposal where I keep a considerable share of high-value items:\n\n- **Offer to Player 2**: [1, 1, 3, 1, 2] \n- **Items I Keep**: [1, 3, 3, 2, 1]\n\n**My Value Calculation**:\n- Item 1: 71 x 1 = 71\n- Item 2: 84 x 3 = 252\n- Item 3: 47 x 3 = 141\n- Item 4: 93 x 2 = 186\n- Item 5: 23 x 1 = 23\n\n**Total Value to Me**: 71 + 252 + 141 + 186 + 23 = 673\n\nThis value is significantly higher than my outside offer of 251, ensuring it is worth more to me to propose this division.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The proposed offer provides a value of 673 to me, which is well above my outside offer.\n- This offer avoids making mistakes like undervaluing my share below my outside offer.\n- It respects the need to find a beneficial deal in the first round to avoid heavy discounting in subsequent rounds.\n\n**Decision**: I will propose the counteroffer of offering Player 2: [1, 1, 3, 1, 2].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 1, 2]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 952. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 952. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 5, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 85 x 4 + 61 x 5 + 77 x 3 + 25 x 3\n    which is 951 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 952. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 952. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 792 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 5, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 85 x 4 + 61 x 5 + 77 x 3 + 25 x 3\n    which is 951 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 952. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 5, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 5, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 9. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 9. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 0 + 3 x 2 + 78 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 58 x 0\n    which is 6 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 9. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's analyze the current situation and the given offer:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** 1079\n- **Values of the Items (per unit):**\n  - Item 1: 18\n  - Item 2: 95\n  - Item 3: 71\n  - Item 4: 82\n  - Item 5: 76\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - Item 1: 6 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor gamma is 0.9. Being in round 1, accepting an offer or concluding now does not apply the discount yet. The final calculation applying gamma would be relevant in round 2 if we push for another round.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer (Player 1 gives you): [4, 1, 3, 1, 1]**\n  - Value of 4 units of Item 1: 4 \u00d7 18 = 72\n  - Value of 1 unit of Item 2: 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n  - Value of 3 units of Item 3: 3 \u00d7 71 = 213\n  - Value of 1 unit of Item 4: 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n  - Value of 1 unit of Item 5: 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n  - **Total Value:** 72 + 95 + 213 + 82 + 76 = 538\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer:** \n  - The current offer's value (538) is significantly lower than the outside offer value (1079).\n\n### 3) Decision Analysis:\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer?**\n  - The current offer is worth 538, which is much less than the outside offer of 1079. Mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse than your outside offer) applies here, so I should not accept.\n\n- **Walk Away and Take Outside Offer?**\n  - Walking away means securing a value of 1079. However, since this is only round 1, exploring a counteroffer could still lead to a preferable outcome without applying a discount.\n\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?**\n  - I need to consider a counteroffer that is worth more than 1079 by keeping more items of higher value.\n\nTo maximize my value, I will propose a counteroffer where I keep most high-value items. Let's offer Player 1 one of each unit, so:\n\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n- **Calculate My Value for Counteroffer:**\n  - My share (keeping): [5, 3, 5, 2, 2]\n  - Value: (5\u00d718) + (3\u00d795) + (5\u00d771) + (2\u00d782) + (2\u00d776) \n  - Calculated Value = 90 + 285 + 355 + 164 + 152 = 1046\n\nAlthough this counteroffer still falls slightly below my outside offer, it suggests a better position than both accepting the current deal and attempting another round under negotiation.\n\nThus:\n- I will propose this counteroffer to increase the value closer to my outside offer, while recognizing in future counteroffers may need an adjustment if Player 1 proposes or accepts better terms.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 3, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 1 + 75 x 0 + 36 x 3 + 53 x 0 + 30 x 2\n    which is 190 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 191. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on my action, let's walk through the steps:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 504.\n   - My values for the items:\n     - Item 1: 41\n     - Item 2: 90\n     - Item 3: 97\n     - Item 4: 59\n     - Item 5: 82\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - Item 1: 6\n     - Item 2: 4\n     - Item 3: 4\n     - Item 4: 3\n     - Item 5: 4\n   - Discount factor influences by reducing the value of our outcome in later rounds. However, in round 1, this does not matter yet.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer to me: [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n     - Value calculation:\n       - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 97 = 0\n       - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 59 = 59\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n     - Total value for current offer = 82 + 90 + 0 + 59 + 164 = 395\n\n   - Compare 395 (current offer's total value) to my outside offer value of 504:\n     - The current offer is less valuable than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer, valued at 395 to me, is worse than my outside offer, worth 504.\n   - Therefore, I should not accept this offer as that would be Mistake 4.\n   - I can either WALK or make a COUNTEROFFER that provides me with a value higher than 504.\n   - To propose a counteroffer, I should aim to receive items such that their total value is greater than 504.\n\nLet's consider keeping a significant portion of high-value items such as items 2, 3, and 5, given their higher values to me. Here's a proposed division:\n\n   - Possible Counteroffer: I propose to keep all units of item 3 (4 units) and most units of item 5 (3 units), as they are the most valuable. Give player 1:\n     - [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] (leaving myself with 5, 3, 4, 2, 3):\n     - Calculation:\n       - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 41 = 205\n       - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270\n       - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 97 = 388\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n       - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n     - Total value for counteroffer = 205 + 270 + 388 + 118 + 246 = 1227\n\nThe counteroffer yields a value far above my outside offer, making it a good negotiating position. Therefore, I choose to make this counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 731. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 765 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 4, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    78 x 4 + 24 x 2 + 53 x 4 + 42 x 1 + 58 x 2\n    which is 730 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 731. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?
