Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 226. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 226. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 462 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 18 x 0 + 2 x 0 + 72 x 2 + 40 x 2\n    which is 224 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 226. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 48. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 870 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 90 x 0 + 31 x 1 + 91 x 0 + 14 x 1\n    which is 45 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 48. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation, calculate our possible offers, and evaluate our best course of action.\n\n### 1) Analyzing the Current Situation:\n- **My outside offer value:** 48\n- **My values per unit of each item:**\n  - Item 1: 64\n  - Item 2: 90\n  - Item 3: 31\n  - Item 4: 91\n  - Item 5: 14\n- **The total pool of items available to divide:**\n  - Item 1: 4 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 7 units\n  - Item 4: 0 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units \n- **Discount factor effect:** Applying the discount factor (\\(\\gamma = 0.9\\)) matters in later rounds since the value of any deal will be reduced. A deal made in this round will not be affected by the discount.\n\n### 2) Assessing the Value of Offers:\nSince there's no current offer, let's consider potential counteroffers.\n\n#### My Full Value for Keeping All Items:\n- \\(4 \\times 64 = 256\\) for item 1\n- \\(3 \\times 90 = 270\\) for item 2\n- \\(7 \\times 31 = 217\\) for item 3\n- \\(0 \\times 91 = 0\\) for item 4\n- \\(2 \\times 14 = 28\\) for item 5\n- **Total value if I keep all:** \\(256 + 270 + 217 + 0 + 28 = 771\\)\n\n#### Example Counteroffer Calculation:\nLet's offer a division that allows me to get more than 48 in value and leaves some for Player 2.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 704. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 693 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 1, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 36 x 3 + 72 x 5 + 32 x 1 + 29 x 7\n    which is 703 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 704. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on my action, I'll follow the provided step-by-step strategy:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 704\n   - Values of items to me:\n     - Item 1: 62\n     - Item 2: 36\n     - Item 3: 72\n     - Item 4: 32\n     - Item 5: 29\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 4 units\n     - Item 3: 5 units\n     - Item 4: 2 units\n     - Item 5: 8 units\n   - The discount factor influences the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers by reducing the present value of later offers. However, since we're in the first round, committing to a strong initial offer can set a beneficial tone for the negotiation.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - There is no current offer on the table, so I will craft an initial offer.\n   - I need to create a counteroffer that ensures my value from the division is at least 704 or higher.\n   - To ensure this, I'll calculate potential offers until I find a satisfactory one:\n\n     - Assume I propose offering Player 2: [1, 2, 3, 1, 4] (i.e., keep [1, 2, 2, 1, 4] for myself)\n     - My value:\n       - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n       - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 32 = 32\n       - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 29 = 116\n     - Total value = 426\n\n     This is significantly below my outside offer of 704. I'll make adjustments to balance it.\n\n     - Assume I offer Player 2: [0, 1, 2, 0, 3] (i.e., keep [2, 3, 3, 2, 5] for myself)\n     - My value:\n       - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n       - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n       - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n       - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 29 = 145\n     - Total value = 657\n\n     Again, this is below my outside offer.\n\n     - Assume I offer Player 2: [0, 1, 1, 0, 3] (i.e., keep [2, 3, 4, 2, 5] for myself)\n     - My value:\n       - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n       - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n       - Item 3: 4 \u00d7 72 = 288\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n       - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 29 = 145\n     - Total value = 729\n\n     This value is greater than my outside offer of 704. Therefore, this division is acceptable.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n\n   Given my analysis, I should propose a counteroffer with a division that gives me a value greater than my outside offer, such as [0, 1, 1, 0, 3].\n\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]}",

My highest value items are:\n- Item 4: 77 per unit (2 total units)\n- Item 1: 74 per unit (2 total units)\n- Item 5: 51 per unit (8 total units)\n- Item 3: 22 per unit (5 total units)\n- Item 2: 4 per unit (4 total units)\n\nIdeally, I want to keep most of the high-value items for myself. \n\nLet me try a counteroffer where I keep all of item 1, item 4, most of item 5, and give Player 1 most of the low-value items:\n\nMy counteroffer (what I give to Player 1):\n[0, 4, 3, 0, 2]\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 4 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n- 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 51 = 306\n\nTotal value to me: 652\n\nWith the discount factor for round 2 (0.9), this would be worth 652 \u00d7 0.9 = 586.8, which is better than my outside offer of 389.\n\nHowever, since we are already in round 2, if Player 1 rejects this offer and we move to round 3, any deal would be further discounted.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 1, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 36 x 3 + 72 x 5 + 32 x 1 + 29 x 7\n    which is 703 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 704. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 0, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 3, 2, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 4, 3, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 4, 3, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's try adjusting the initial hypothetical offer:\n\nLet's adjust it to:\n- Give Player 2: \n  - Item 1: 0 units\n  - Item 2: 0 units\n  - Item 3: 2 units\n  - Item 4: 1 unit\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n\n**My share would be:**\n- Item 1: 2 units\n- Item 3: 6 units\n- Item 4: 3 units\n- Item 5: 6 units\n\nValue Calculation:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- Item 3: 6 \u00d7 75 = 450\n- Item 4: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n- Item 5: 6 \u00d7 80 = 480\n\n**Total value for me:** 6 + 450 + 153 + 480 = 1089\n\nWith this division, my value exceeds my outside offer of 1027.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 1, 3]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 3, 9] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 1 + 27 x 0 + 75 x 2 + 51 x 3 + 80 x 9\n    which is 1026 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1027. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In Round 2, the value is multiplied by 1 (0.9^1), meaning no discount has yet been applied to the current or any accepted offer at this stage.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer Value:** For the current offer of [0, 0, 2, 3, 8] (offered to me):\n     - Item 1: 0 units = 0 x 3 = 0\n     - Item 2: 0 units = 0 x 27 = 0\n     - Item 3: 2 units = 2 x 75 = 150\n     - Item 4: 3 units = 3 x 51 = 153\n     - Item 5: 8 units = 8 x 80 = 640\n     - Total Value = 0 + 0 + 150 + 153 + 640 = 943\n     - Discounted Value = 943 x 0.9 = 848.7\n\n   - **Comparing Current Offer with Outside Offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (848.7) is less than my outside offer (1027).\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - **Accept the Current Offer?** No, since the current offer (848.7) is less valuable than my outside offer (1027).\n   - **Walk Away?** This would secure my outside offer value of 1027.\n   - **Propose a Counteroffer?** I want to propose a counteroffer that maximizes my outcome without making the mistakes mentioned. \n\nTo craft a counteroffer, I should aim to retain a combination of items such that my total value exceeds 1027.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 98. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 648 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 15 x 0 + 68 x 1 + 51 x 0 + 29 x 1\n    which is 97 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 98. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Therefore, I need to propose an initial offer.\n   - I need to ensure any offer I propose has a value to me greater than 98, which is my outside offer value.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since there is no current offer, walking away is not optimal without first proposing an offer better than my outside offer.\n   - I will propose an offer that maximizes my value while still being reasonable.\n\nLet's calculate a reasonable counteroffer:\n\nAssuming I keep most items and calculate the values:\n\n- Offer Player 2:\n  - 3 units of item 1 (keeping 4 for myself)\n  - 2 units of item 2 (keeping 2 for myself)\n  - 2 units of item 3 (keeping 3 for myself)\n  - 0 units of item 4 (keeping 1 for myself)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (keeping 3 for myself)\n\nValue to me for what I keep:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 53 = 212\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 15 = 30\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 68 = 204\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n\nTotal value to me = 584, which is greater than my outside offer value of 98.\n\nThus, I will propose this division to ensure I maximize my value, avoiding mistakes such as offering less value than the outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 2, 2, 0, 3]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 511. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 4, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 1 + 89 x 0 + 75 x 1 + 36 x 4 + 39 x 7\n    which is 510 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 511. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I'll go through the step-by-step analysis as suggested. \n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n- **Outside offer value**: 511\n- **Values of the items involved**:\n  - Item 1: 18\n  - Item 2: 89\n  - Item 3: 75\n  - Item 4: 36\n  - Item 5: 39\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 8 units of item 5\n- **Discount factor influence**: Because no offer has been made, the discount factor does not currently apply. However, as the rounds progress, the value of any negotiated outcome will be multiplied by gamma^(r-1), where r is the round number. Since this is round 1, there's no discount yet.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\nSince there is no current offer, I'll need to consider potential counteroffers.\n \nI'll need to make an offer that provides me a value higher than my outside offer (511). To do this, I'll consider some allocations:\n\nLet's try a simple division:\n- Offer most of the less valued items and keep a larger share of items that add value for me. For instance, an offer where I keep a greater number of high personal value items (like item 2, given its highest value per unit of 89, and item 3 with value 75).\n\n#### Proposed offer to Player 2:\n- Offering Player 2: [1, 4, 1, 2, 4]\n\n#### Calculate my value if I keep: [3, 1, 1, 2, 4]\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n  - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n  - **Total Value** = 54 + 89 + 75 + 72 + 156 = 446\n\nSince this allocation gives me a total value of 446, which is less than 511, I should adjust my offer.\n\n#### Try another offer to further improve my allocation: Exchange a more balanced number of items to enhance return above 511.\n- Offer Player 2: [2, 3, 1, 2, 4]\n\n#### Calculate my value if I keep: [2, 2, 1, 2, 4]\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n  - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n  - **Total Value** = 36 + 178 + 75 + 72 + 156 = 517\n\nNow, my proposal brings me a total value of 517, which is greater than my outside offer of 511.\n\n### 3) Decision:\n- Since this offer mitigates the risk of falling below 511 and positions me favorably with a value greater than my fallback, I will proceed with this counteroffer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 2, 4]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 4, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 1 + 89 x 0 + 75 x 1 + 36 x 4 + 39 x 7\n    which is 510 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 511. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 26 x 0 + 29 x 0 + 16 x 1 + 6 x 1\n    which is 22 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 26. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 3, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

The value of any agreement is multiplied by \\(\\gamma^{r-1}\\), where \\(r\\) is the round number. In this case, it's round 1, so \\(\\gamma^0 = 1\\). Therefore, there is no reduction currently.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**: There's no current offer to evaluate.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to make an initial offer that maximizes my value and exceeds my outside offer.\n\n    Let's evaluate a few possible counteroffers:\n\n    - **Keep Everything** (`offer`: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] - You offer nothing to Player 2):\n      - Value = \\(5 \\times 82 + 7 \\times 24 + 3 \\times 79 + 5 \\times 54 = 1085\\)\n      - This value is far better than the outside offer. However, it is likely not acceptable to Player 2.\n\nLet's try another reasonable offer:\n\n- **Offer Example** (`keeping [3, 4, 2, 3, 0]` - Giving [2, 3, 1, 2, 0] to Player 2):\n  - My Value (keeping [3, 4, 2, 3, 0]):\n    - \\(3 \\times 82 + 4 \\times 24 + 2 \\times 79 + 3 \\times 54 + 0 \\times 13 = 840\\)\n\nThis offer of keeping [3, 4, 2, 3, 0] results in a value of 840, which is better than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- **Action**: I should propose a counteroffer that gives Plaer 2 a few items but still secures me more value than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, the action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 2, 0]}\n```\n\nThis offer ensures that my value of 840 is higher than my outside offer while providing Player 2 with items.",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 3, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 2 + 24 x 5 + 79 x 3 + 54 x 4 + 13 x 0\n    which is 737 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 738. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 4, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 738. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 756 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 5, 3, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    82 x 2 + 24 x 5 + 79 x 3 + 54 x 4 + 13 x 0\n    which is 737 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 738. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 4, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer value is 358.\n   - **Values of the items involved:**\n     - Item 1: 3 units value per each\n     - Item 2: 13 units value per each\n     - Item 3: 37 units value per each\n     - Item 4: 60 units value per each\n     - Item 5: 8 units value per each\n     \n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - 8 units of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 6 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n     \n   - **Discount factor:** With gamma = 0.9, the value of any deal is multiplied by gamma^(r-1). Since this is round 1, gamma^(1-1) = 1, so the discount does not affect my decision in the first round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of potential offers:**\n\n   Since there is no current offer from Player 2, my task is to create a counteroffer that ensures my total value meets or exceeds my outside offer value of 358.\n\n   - I need to calculate various offers to see what allocations meet or exceed this value.\n  \n   For instance:\n   - Let's assume I keep all items, which gives me a value of:\n     - 8 x 3 + 3 x 13 + 6 x 37 + 1 x 60 + 3 x 8\n     - Total value = 24 + 39 + 222 + 60 + 24 = 369\n\n   Since I can get the full value of 369 by keeping everything (which I wouldn't offer as it's mistake 3), let's test slightly different distributions.\n\n   - If I consider keeping 7 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5:\n     - Value = 7 x 3 + 2 x 13 + 5 x 37 + 1 x 60 + 2 x 8\n     - Value = 21 + 26 + 185 + 60 + 16 = 308\n\n   This would be too low since 308 < 358. Let's adjust the distribution further.\n\n   - If I try keeping 8 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5:\n     - Value = 8 x 3 + 3 x 13 + 4 x 37 + 1 x 60 + 2 x 8\n     - Value = 24 + 39 + 148 + 60 + 16 = 287\n\n   Still too low. Let's modify it again.\n\n   - If I try keeping 8 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5:\n     - Value = 8 x 3 + 3 x 13 + 5 x 37 + 1 x 60 + 1 x 8\n     - Value = 24 + 39 + 185 + 60 + 8 = 316 \n\n   Still not enough.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 358. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 363 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 3, 6, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    3 x 4 + 13 x 3 + 37 x 6 + 60 x 1 + 8 x 3\n    which is 357 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 358. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 660. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 76 x 2 + 93 x 2 + 77 x 4 + 2 x 1\n    which is 659 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 660. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Therefore, obtaining a favorable agreement sooner rather than later is advantageous.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\nSince there is no current offer from the other player, we'll explore potential offers.\n\nI need to construct an offer ensuring that my retained items' value exceeds my outside offer of 660.\n\nLet's consider different potential divisions and calculate their values:\n\n1. **Proposal**: Offer Player 2 one unit of each item.\n   - **Retained by Me**:\n     - Item 1: 3 units \u00d7 11 = 33\n     - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 76 = 304\n     - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 93 = 93\n     - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 77 = 231\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 2 = 2\n   - **Total Value for Me**: 33 + 304 + 93 + 231 + 2 = 663\n\nThis division results in a value of 663 for me, which is slightly more than my outside offer of 660.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- Since there is no current offer to accept, and WALK is not optimal because I can exceed my outside offer, the best course of action is to propose the calculated counteroffer above.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```\n\nThis counteroffer gives one unit of each item to Player 2 while retaining a total value of 663 for myself, which is higher than my outside offer of 660.",

                    "response": "Let's go through the analysis step-by-step to determine the best action to take in this negotiation.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 660.\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 11 per unit\n  - Item 2: 76 per unit\n  - Item 3: 93 per unit\n  - Item 4: 77 per unit\n  - Item 5: 2 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 5 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 4 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. Since we are in round 2, the value of any accepted offer would be multiplied by \\(0.9^{(2-1)} = 0.9\\). \n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer:** [1, 4, 2, 2, 0]\n  - For me, this effectively means I would end up with:\n    - 3 units of item 1\n    - 1 unit of item 2\n    - 0 units of item 3 \n    - 2 units of item 4\n    - 2 units of item 5\n  - My total value for this offer:\n    - Value from items:\n      - Item 1: 3 x 11 = 33\n      - Item 2: 1 x 76 = 76\n      - Item 3: 0 x 93 = 0\n      - Item 4: 2 x 77 = 154\n      - Item 5: 2 x 2 = 4\n    - Total value without discount: 33 + 76 + 0 + 154 + 4 = 267\n    - Discounted value: 267 x 0.9 = 240.3\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:** My outside offer is 660. Accepting the current offer provides 240.3, which is much less than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Current Offer:** The current offer gives me 240.3, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 660. Therefore, accepting it would be mistake 4.\n- **Walk Away:** If I walk away, I secure the value of my outside offer, 660.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer:**\n  - My goal is to get a value greater than 660, ideally above my outside offer after accounting for future rounds' discounting.\n  - Assuming I offer a counteroffer like [1, 0, 0, 0, 2], I keep:\n    - 3 units of item 1: 3 x 11 = 33\n    - 5 units of item 2: 5 x 76 = 380\n    - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 93 = 186\n    - 4 units of item 4: 4 x 77 = 308\n    - 0 units of item 5: 0 x 2 = 0\n    - Total value without discount = 33 + 380 + 186 + 308 + 0 = 907\n    - Discounted value: 907 x 0.9 = 816.3\n\nThis counteroffer gives me a discounted value of 816.3, which is greater than my outside offer. Therefore, it is a valid and better option.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 2]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 2, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 76 x 2 + 93 x 2 + 77 x 4 + 2 x 1\n    which is 659 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 660. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Here's a potential allocation:\n\n  1. Keep: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 unit of item 5\n     - Value: \n       - Item 1: 2 x 25 = 50\n       - Item 2: 2 x 73 = 146\n       - Item 3: 2 x 98 = 196\n       - Item 4: 1 x 93 = 93\n       - Item 5: 3 x 11 = 33\n     - Total value: 50 + 146 + 196 + 93 + 33 = 518\n\n  This offer gives me a total value of 518, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 406.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on the analysis, I should make an initial counteroffer that ensures my total value exceeds my outside offer. The distribution above is a fair start, providing me with a high enough value without causing Player 2 to walk away immediately in their first action. \n\nGiven the information, my action is to propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 2]}\n```\n\nThis offer indicates that I'm giving 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 to Player 2.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 1 + 73 x 1 + 98 x 3 + 93 x 0 + 11 x 1\n    which is 403 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 406. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 406. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 900 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 1 + 73 x 1 + 98 x 3 + 93 x 0 + 11 x 1\n    which is 403 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 406. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** 406\n- **Item Values:** \n  - Item 1: 25 per unit\n  - Item 2: 73 per unit\n  - Item 3: 98 per unit\n  - Item 4: 93 per unit\n  - Item 5: 11 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** Since it's round 3, accepting an offer now gives full value multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{r-1} = 0.9^2 = 0.81 \\).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer:** [2, 1, 0, 0, 3]\n  - Value if I accept it: \n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 73 = 73\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 98 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 93 = 0\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n  - Total value = 50 + 73 + 0 + 0 + 33 = 156\n  - Discounted value = 156 \u00d7 0.81 = 126.36\n\n- **Compare to Outside Offer:** The discounted value of accepting is 126.36, which is less than my outside offer of 406. Therefore, accepting it would be worse than my outside offer.\n\n- **Considerations for Counteroffer:** Any counteroffer I propose should yield me more than 406.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\nTo avoid mistakes, I need to ensure:\n- My offer is worth more than my outside offer (406).\n- The offer doesn't result in a scenario worse than previously proposed options.\n\nAssume I try to keep the optimal distribution for maximum value:\n- **Proposed Counteroffer:** [1, 1, 3, 0, 3] for Player 2 (this is what I give to them)\n  - Items I keep: [2, 3, 0, 1, 2]\n  - Value for me:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 98 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n  - Total value = 50 + 219 + 0 + 93 + 22 = 384\n  - Discounted value = 384 \u00d7 0.81 = 310.56\n\nThis is less than my outside offer, so I need a plan that doesn't compromise my outcome. It seems making any reasonable offer within the specific rounds and discounting results in values less than 406 due to the lower rounds and gamma factor.\n\nGiven all this, **walking away** will secure me the highest confirmed value based on current calculations.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 5, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 2 + 60 x 2 + 99 x 5 + 62 x 3 + 61 x 2\n    which is 933 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 934. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 4, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 8, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 8, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Given that it's round 2, the value of the outcome is adjusted by gamma^1 (gamma to the power of (r-1)).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n**Current Offer Evaluation**:\n- Current offer: [1, 1, 8, 2, 1]\n  - Value to me: \n    - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 5 = 5\n    - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 60 = 60\n    - Item 3: 8 units \u00d7 99 = 792\n    - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 62 = 124\n    - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 61 = 61\n  - Total value: 5 + 60 + 792 + 124 + 61 = 1042\n\n**Discounted Value in Round 2**: \n- Discounted total value = 1042 \u00d7 0.9 = 937.8\n\n**Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n- My outside offer is 934. Since the discounted total value of accepting the current offer (937.8) is greater than my outside offer (934), accepting gives me a higher payoff.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- The current offer yields a discounted value of 937.8, which is higher than the outside offer of 934.\n- Given that accepting the current offer provides a higher value compared to the outside offer, and considering the potential diminishing returns with further discounts in subsequent rounds, it is beneficial to accept the current offer.\n\nTherefore, the optimal action to maximize my payoff is to accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 7, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 3 + 46 x 3 + 60 x 7 + 94 x 2 + 82 x 5\n    which is 1435 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1436. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 5, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 4, 6, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 6, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Right now, we're in the second round, so no discount is applied to the offer.\n\n2) Assessing the Value of Offers:\n   - Value of the current offer being given to me: [2, 4, 6, 2, 1]\n     - Item 1: 2 units x 93 = 186\n     - Item 2: 4 units x 46 = 184\n     - Item 3: 6 units x 60 = 360\n     - Item 4: 2 units x 94 = 188\n     - Item 5: 1 unit x 82 = 82\n     - Total value = 186 + 184 + 360 + 188 + 82 = 1000\n   - Compare to my outside offer: 1000 is less than 1436.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 87. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 87. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 930 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    83 x 1 + 81 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 3 x 1 + 78 x 0\n    which is 86 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 87. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's break down the analysis step-by-step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer is 87.\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 83 per unit\n  - Item 2: 81 per unit\n  - Item 3: 65 per unit\n  - Item 4: 3 per unit\n  - Item 5: 78 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 3 units of Item 1\n  - 4 units of Item 2\n  - 3 units of Item 3\n  - 2 units of Item 4\n  - 1 unit of Item 5\n- **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9, which means if negotiations extend, the present value of the deal is decreased. Therefore, securing a favorable deal earlier is advantageous to retain as much value as possible.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer:** None at the moment.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - I need to propose offers where the value I receive is greater than my outside offer of 87.\n\n#### Calculating My Values for Different Divisions:\n1. **Keep Most Valuable Items:**\n   - **Offer [0, 0, 1, 2, 0] to Player 2:**\n   - I keep [3, 4, 2, 0, 1].\n     - Value = \\(3 \\times 83 + 4 \\times 81 + 2 \\times 65 + 0 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 78 = 249 + 324 + 130 + 0 + 78 = 781\\)\n\n2. **Balancing Offer:**\n   - **Offer [1, 2, 2, 2, 0] to Player 2:**\n   - I keep [2, 2, 1, 0, 1].\n     - Value = \\(2 \\times 83 + 2 \\times 81 + 1 \\times 65 + 0 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 78 = 166 + 162 + 65 + 0 + 78 = 471\\)\n\nIn both cases, the values I receive are much greater than my outside offer of 87. Avoiding a mistake, I should propose a counteroffer that aligns with my objective, ensuring I claim a majority share of high-value items.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n- Since I have no current offer to evaluate, I need to propose an initial offer taking into account the value breakdowns.\n\nGiven that I must propose a counteroffer that guarantees me more than my outside offer and avoids mistakes mentioned in the instructions, I will make an initial offer where I keep the items weighted by my utility, ensuring a high value for myself, but reasonable enough to continue negotiation.\n\n**Proposed Action:**\n- I will offer the following to Player 2, aiming to maximize my value while ensuring the offer is better than my outside offer. I will keep a large portion for me to ensure that it is high enough.\n \n**Counteroffer:** Offer [0, 2, 3, 2, 0] to Player 2 (I keep [3, 2, 0, 0, 1]).\n\nThe value I receive with this offer:\n- My units: [3, 2, 0, 0, 1]\n- Value = \\(3 \\times 83 + 2 \\times 81 + 0 \\times 65 + 0 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 78 = 249 + 162 + 0 + 0 + 78 = 489\\).\n\nSince my value (489) is greater than my outside offer (87), this proposed division is a strong opening offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 2, 0]}\n```",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, I need to carefully evaluate the situation using the step-by-step analysis provided.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 383.\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 21 per unit\n  - Item 2: 87 per unit\n  - Item 3: 44 per unit\n  - Item 4: 2 per unit\n  - Item 5: 37 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 9 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) means any value realized in future rounds will be less attractive compared to the current round. Thus, earlier agreements generally provide higher net value due to the absence of discounting effects.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer Value:** There is no offer on the table yet.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - I need to find a division where the value to me exceeds or equals my outside offer of 383.\n  - Let's calculate potential divisions:\n  \n#### Potential Offer 1:\n- Keep [1, 1, 3, 5, 2], Offer [2, 1, 2, 4, 3] to Player 2:\n  - Value to me: \n    - (1 x 21) + (1 x 87) + (3 x 44) + (5 x 2) + (2 x 37)\n    - = 21 + 87 + 132 + 10 + 74\n    - = 324, which is less than 383.\n\n#### Potential Offer 2:\n- Keep [2, 1, 3, 7, 4], Offer [1, 1, 2, 2, 1] to Player 2:\n  - Value to me:\n    - (2 x 21) + (1 x 87) + (3 x 44) + (7 x 2) + (4 x 37)\n    - = 42 + 87 + 132 + 14 + 148\n    - = 423, which is more than 383.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- Since I want to maximize my value and the value of this potential offer (423) is greater than my outside offer (383), it is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It also avoids the mistakes outlined, as it is more valuable than walking away and doesn't give away more items than necessary.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the best action is to propose a counteroffer like Potential Offer 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 7, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 44 x 5 + 2 x 7 + 37 x 4\n    which is 382 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 383. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 18 x 1 + 29 x 0 + 14 x 4 + 72 x 1\n    which is 146 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 147. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's consider an allocation where I retain as many high-value items as possible:\n\n- I keep 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n- Offer to Player 2:  [1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5]\n\nLet's calculate the value based on the units I proposed keeping:\n- For myself:\n  - Item 1: 6 \u00d7 89 = 534\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n  - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n  - Item 4: 8 \u00d7 23 = 184\n  - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n\nTotal value = 534 + 60 + 126 + 184 + 150 = 1054\n\nSince 1054 is substantially higher than 590, this offer satisfies my need to achieve greater value than my outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 7, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 1 + 83 x 5 + 80 x 7 + 72 x 2 + 81 x 1\n    which is 1237 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1238. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 3, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 3, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1238. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1238. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1059 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 5, 7, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    37 x 1 + 83 x 5 + 80 x 7 + 72 x 2 + 81 x 1\n    which is 1237 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1238. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 3, 3, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 2, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 2, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 445. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 445. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 1, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 3 + 64 x 0 + 34 x 1 + 97 x 2 + 70 x 3\n    which is 444 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 445. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To make a well-informed decision, let's go through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation**:\n   - My outside offer value is **824**.\n   - My values for the items involved are:\n     - Item 1: 47\n     - Item 2: 97\n     - Item 3: 90\n     - Item 4: 8\n     - Item 5: 12\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 4 units of item 1,\n     - 7 units of item 2,\n     - 3 units of item 3,\n     - 3 units of item 4,\n     - 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor gamma = 0.9 influences the decision because if the negotiation takes multiple rounds (r), the outcome is multiplied by \\(\\gamma^{(r-1)}\\). Hence, a quick favorable outcome is more valuable than a delayed one.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers**:\n   - Currently, there is no offer to accept.\n   - Given the lack of an offer, I'll need to consider potential counteroffers. The goal is to ensure that any proposal I make results in a value that exceeds my outside offer of 824.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis**:\n   - With no offer on the table, it's my role to make an initial proposal that exceeds my outside offer. Let's calculate a few potential offers and their values to me.\n\nExample potential offers I could propose:\n   - Keeping more valuable items and offering lesser-valued ones.\n\nLet's calculate the value to me if I keep 2 units of items with higher value to me (items 2 and 3) and offer the remaining to Player 2:\n\n- [2, 5, 2, 3, 3]:\n  - Value to me = (2 \u00d7 47) + (2 \u00d7 97) + (1 \u00d7 90) + (0 \u00d7 8) + (0 \u00d7 12)\n               = 94 + 194 + 90 + 0 + 0\n               = 378 (which is less than 824)\n\nThis allocation does not give me 824, so further iteration is needed. Let's try a more balanced proposal:\n\n- [3, 4, 2, 3, 1]:\n  - Value to me = (1 \u00d7 47) + (3 \u00d7 97) + (1 \u00d7 90) + (0 \u00d7 8) + (2 \u00d7 12)\n               = 47 + 291 + 90 + 0 + 24\n               = 452 (still less than 824)\n\nAnother attempt:\n\n- [1, 3, 0, 2, 2]:\n  - Value to me = (3 \u00d7 47) + (4 \u00d7 97) + (3 \u00d7 90) + (1 \u00d7 8) + (1 \u00d7 12)\n               = 141 + 388 + 270 + 8 + 12\n               = 819 (very close to 824)\n\nHowever, another round could slightly tweak this:\n\n- [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]:\n  - Value to me = (3 \u00d7 47) + (5 \u00d7 97) + (3 \u00d7 90) + (1 \u00d7 8) + (2 \u00d7 12)\n               = 141 + 485 + 270 + 8 + 12\n               = 916 (which exceeds 824)\n\nThis proposal clearly exceeds my outside option and would be a suitable offer that maximizes my value given the constraints.\n\n**Decision**:\n\nI will make the counteroffer where I keep enough of the valuable items to exceed my outside offer while still leaving room for negotiation.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 4, 3, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 3 + 97 x 4 + 90 x 3 + 8 x 0 + 12 x 2\n    which is 823 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 824. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n- **Outside Offer Value**: I have an outside offer of 824.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 47 per unit\n  - Item 2: 97 per unit\n  - Item 3: 90 per unit\n  - Item 4: 8 per unit\n  - Item 5: 12 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 7 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: Gamma is 0.9. As we're in round 2, my value for an accepted offer will be multiplied by 0.9.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Value of the Current Offer**: \n  - If I accept Player 2's offer of [2, 3, 2, 2, 1], my allocation is the remaining items:\n    - Item 1: 2 units (2 remain for me as 4 - 2 = 2)\n    - Item 2: 4 units (7 - 3 = 4)\n    - Item 3: 1 unit (3 - 2 = 1)\n    - Item 4: 1 unit (3 - 2 = 1)\n    - Item 5: 2 units (3 - 1 = 2)\n  - Value if accepting: \n    - 2 * 47 (Item 1) = 94\n    - 4 * 97 (Item 2) = 388\n    - 1 * 90 (Item 3) = 90\n    - 1 * 8 (Item 4) = 8\n    - 2 * 12 (Item 5) = 24\n  - Total Value = 604 \n  - Discounted Value: 604 * 0.9 = 543.6\n\n  Since 543.6 is less than my outside offer of 824, accepting this offer is worse than walking away.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose a division of items that results in a value greater than 824. \n\n  I need to find allocations that yield my value above 824 without significantly losing any major item, especially item 2, which I value the most. \n\n  I should aim to get at least a significant share of the high-value items. I'll try to get 3 or 4 units of item 2 given its high value to me, while trying not to go below necessary thresholds for other valuable items.\n\n- **Potential Counter Offer Calculation**:\n\n  Let's propose:\n  - Offering Player 2, [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n  - This means keeping [3, 4, 2, 2, 2] for myself.\n\n  - Calculate:\n    - 3 * 47 (Item 1) = 141\n    - 4 * 97 (Item 2) = 388\n    - 2 * 90 (Item 3) = 180\n    - 2 * 8 (Item 4) = 16\n    - 2 * 12 (Item 5) = 24\n  - Total Value = 749\n\n  - Discounted Value for round 1 = 749 * 0.9 = 674.1\n\n  The total value is still lower than my outside offer of 824. So, I'll need to adjust further to a proposal like [3, 4, 2, 0, 3].\n\n  Let's calculate:\n\n  - Calculate:\n    - 3 * 47 (Item 1) = 141\n    - 4 * 97 (Item 2) = 388\n    - 2 * 90 (Item 3) = 180\n    - 0 * 8 (Item 4) = 0\n    - 3 * 12 (Item 5) = 36\n  - Total Value = 745\n\n  - Discounted Value for round 1 = 745 * 0.9 = 670.5\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nNone of the calculated counteroffers surpass 824 after accounting for the discount factor, and modifying but retaining item 2 as a key element did not yield a better result.\n\nTherefore, my best action is to Walk Away since none of my computations have demonstrated a value exceeding my guaranteed fallback of 824. Implementing another strategy of rearranging items would not suffice either without sufficient conviction on observing opponent values.\n\n**Decision**:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```\n",
