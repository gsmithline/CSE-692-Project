Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1005. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1005. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1038 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 6, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 71 x 4 + 64 x 6 + 33 x 2 + 90 x 3\n    which is 1004 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1005. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 674.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 53, item 2 = 31, item 3 = 55, item 4 = 59, item 5 = 81.\n*   The total pool of items is: 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 4 of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means an offer accepted in a later round is worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n*   The current offer is [0, 0, 0, 1, 4]. This means I receive 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 4 of item 5. Player 1 receives the remaining items.\n*   My value if I accept this offer:\n    *   Item 1: (2 - 0) * 53 = 106\n    *   Item 2: (4 - 0) * 31 = 124\n    *   Item 3: (2 - 0) * 55 = 110\n    *   Item 4: (4 - 1) * 59 = 177\n    *   Item 5: (4 - 4) * 81 = 0\n    *   Total value = 106 + 124 + 110 + 177 + 0 = 517\n*   517 is less than my outside offer of 674.\n\n3) **Assess potential counteroffers:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth less than my outside offer, I should not accept it. I need to determine a counteroffer that provides me with a value greater than 674. I will start by evaluating the extreme counteroffers.\nIf I offer player 1 nothing and keep everything, the value would be:\n*   Item 1: 2 * 53 = 106\n*   Item 2: 4 * 31 = 124\n*   Item 3: 2 * 55 = 110\n*   Item 4: 4 * 59 = 236\n*   Item 5: 4 * 81 = 324\n    Total value = 106 + 124 + 110 + 236 + 324 = 900\nThis is much better than my outside offer. However, offering Player 1 nothing is unlikely to be accepted. I will try to construct a more reasonable offer. I will start by giving Player 1 a little of each item.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 1, 1].\n*   Item 1: (2 - 0) * 53 = 106\n*   Item 2: (4 - 1) * 31 = 93\n*   Item 3: (2 - 0) * 55 = 110\n*   Item 4: (4 - 1) * 59 = 177\n*   Item 5: (4 - 1) * 81 = 243\n    Total value = 106 + 93 + 110 + 177 + 243 = 729\nThis is greater than my outside offer.\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\n\nSince I am in round 1, and I can make a counteroffer, I will make a counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Therefore, I should not accept it.\n   - Let's consider a few potential counteroffers. I need to keep enough items to get a value greater than 748.88\n      - Let's try to give Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]: My holdings will be [2, 3, 2, 3, 3] which has value 2*53 + 3*31 + 2*55 + 3*59 + 3*81 = 106 + 93 + 110 + 177 + 243 = 729.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 200. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 200. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 924 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 0 + 61 x 2 + 76 x 1 + 64 x 0 + 17 x 0\n    which is 198 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 200. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 1 + 50 x 1 + 47 x 3 + 89 x 1 + 91 x 1\n    which is 424 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 426. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since accepting the current offer yields only 91, a counteroffer or walking seems more strategic.\n\n     - Assess potential divisions:\n       - Let's consider [1, 0, 3, 1, 2] (giving [1, 2, 0, 0, 4] to Player 2):\n         - Value to me = (1 * 53) + (0 * 50) + (3 * 47) + (1 * 89) + (2 * 91) = 53 + 0 + 141 + 89 + 182 = 465\n\n   - The value of 465 is higher than my outside offer of 426.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\n   - The current offer is significantly below my outside offer (91 < 426), so I should not ACCEPT it.\n   - Walking away leads to a certain value of 426, but a counteroffer with a value of 465 increases my payoff.\n   - Therefore, I should make a counteroffer while ensuring not to violate any strategic mistakes.\n\nThus, the best choice is to make a counteroffer that secures a value greater than my current outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 0, 4]}\n```",

This means if we accept an offer in later rounds, its effective value to us will be reduced.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Since there is no current offer from Player 2, we must make an initial offer.\n   - To maximize my outcome, I need a counteroffer where the resulting value is greater than my outside offer of 562.\n\n3) Create a counteroffer:\n   - I will first determine the distribution where I maximize my value while offering Player 2 enough items to keep the submitted proposal reasonable.\n   - Let's assume a distribution and calculate:\n\n   Proposal: Keep [3, 2, 4, 3, 0] units for myself, and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n   Calculating my total value from this distribution:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n   - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 26 = 52\n   - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   Total value = 216 + 52 + 104 + 186 + 0 = 558\n\n   - The resulting value (558) is less than my outside offer (562). Thus, this isn't satisfactory.\n\n   Let's try to adjust it so that I get more value by revising the number of item 2 I keep, and adjusting further:\n   \n   Proposal: Keep [3, 1, 5, 3, 0] units for myself, and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n   Calculating my total value from this distribution:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n   - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 26 = 130\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   Total value = 216 + 26 + 130 + 186 + 0 = 558\n\n   Still 558 which is lower than the outside. Let's try a further shift,\n\n   Proposal: Keep [3, 0, 6, 3, 0] units for myself, and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n   Calculating my value:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n   - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n   - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 26 = 156\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   Total value = 216 + 0 + 156 + 186 + 0 = 558\n\n   Again resulting in 558. Let's favor a profitable offer:\n\n   Proposal: Keep [3, 0, 7, 2, 0] units for myself, and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n   Calculating my value:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n   - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n   - 7 units of item 3: 7 \u00d7 26 = 182 \n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   Total value = 216 + 0 + 182 + 124 + 0 = 522\n   \n   Proposal still short, adjusting,\n   \n   Proposal: Keep [3, 0, 6, 2, 0] units for myself, and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n   Calculating my value:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\n   - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n   - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 26 = 156\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   Total value = 216 + 0 + 156 + 124 + 0 = 496\n   \n   Therefore,\n   \n   Proposal: Keep [2, 0, 6, 3, 0] units for myself, and offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n   Calculating my value:\n   - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n   - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 26 = 0\n   - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 26 = 156\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n   - 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 2 = 0\n   Total value = 144 + 0 + 156 + 186 + 0 = 486\n   \n   Finally:\n   \n   Proposal: Keep [3, 0, 5, 3, 0] units for myself and offer the rest to Player 2.\n   \n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 x 72 = 216\n   - 0 units of item 2:  0 x 26 = 0\n   - 5 units of item 3:  5 x 26 = 130\n   - 3 units of item 4:  3 x 62 = 186\n   - 0 units of item 5:  0 x 2 = 0\n   Total value = 216 + 0 + 130 + 186 + 0 = 532\n\nThe adjustments allow an adequate offer I will propose.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 3, 2, 6]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 347. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 4 x 1 + 97 x 0 + 67 x 4 + 74 x 1\n    which is 346 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 347. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 3, 2, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 3, 2, 6]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 361. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 357 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 1, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 3 + 8 x 2 + 11 x 1 + 32 x 4 + 19 x 3\n    which is 359 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 361. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]. This means I keep:\n      - item 1: 3 units\n      - item 2: 2 units\n      - item 3: 1 unit\n      - item 4: 4 units (6-2)\n      - item 5: 2 units (3-1)\n\n   - Value of current offer to me:\n      - 3 * 49 + 2 * 8 + 1 * 11 + 4 * 32 + 2 * 19 = 147 + 16 + 11 + 128 + 38 = 340\n   - This value (340) is LESS than my outside offer (361).\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - Accepting the current offer would give me 340, which is worse than my outside offer of 361.\n   - Walking away would give me 361.\n   - I should make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 361.\n\nLet's try to construct a counteroffer. Let's start by trying to keep as much item 1 as possible, as it has the highest value for me. I want to receive a value greater than 361, so, I will try keeping all item 1, all item 3, and some items 4 and 5 while giving the others to player 1.\nIf I keep all of item 1, item 3, and at least one of the remaining items.\n\nLet's start with the initial allocation:\n- I keep: [3, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n- I give to Player 1: [0, 2, 0, 6, 3]\nThe value for me will be 3 * 49 + 1 * 11 = 147 + 11 = 158. This is lower than 361, so not a good offer for me.\n\nLet's try a counteroffer that offers Player 1 the least valuable items for me.\nI give to Player 1: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nThis means I keep [3, 0, 1, 6, 3]\nThe value for me is 3 * 49 + 1 * 11 + 6 * 32 + 3 * 19 = 147 + 11 + 192 + 57 = 407\nThis is greater than 361.

My value for this offer is:\n    (0 * 49) + (2 * 8) + (0 * 11) + (2 * 32) + (1 * 19) = 0 + 16 + 0 + 64 + 19 = 99\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 99 * 0.9 = 89.1\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (89.1) is significantly less than my outside offer (361).\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that yields a value greater than my outside offer when discounted. Let's consider some scenarios:\n\n    *   Keeping everything: (3 * 49) + (2 * 8) + (1 * 11) + (6 * 32) + (3 * 19) = 147 + 16 + 11 + 192 + 57 = 423. Discounted value = 423 * 0.9 = 380.7\n    *   Giving away item 2 only: offer = [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. My value = 423 - (2 * 8) = 423 - 16 = 407.  Discounted value = 407 * 0.9 = 366.3\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not a good idea, as it is much worse than my outside offer.\n*   Walking away would give me 361.\n*   A counteroffer is the best option, and I need to ensure that I am giving the other player an offer that they are likely to accept.\n*   I will give up only the item that I value least (item 2).\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer that gives player 1 2 units of item 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    11 x 1 + 13 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 20 x 3 + 42 x 0\n    which is 71 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 72. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Instead, I need to consider potential counteroffers. I must propose a division that gives me more than my outside offer value of 72.\n\n#### Possible Allocation Calculation\nTo propose a counteroffer, I need to calculate the value I retain from different possible allocations:\n\n- **Example Counteroffer 1**: \n  - Keep [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] for myself\n  - Offer [0, 2, 1, 5, 3] to Player 2\n  - My Value: \n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 11 \u00d7 1 = 11\n    - 0 units of item 2 = 13 \u00d7 0 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 3 = 68 \u00d7 0 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 20 \u00d7 1 = 20\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 42 \u00d7 1 = 42\n  - Total Value = 11 + 0 + 0 + 20 + 42 = 73\n\nThis allocation gives me a value of 73, which is slightly above my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- The calculated counteroffer gives me a total value of 73, which is better than my outside offer of 72.\n- Therefore, I will propose this as a counteroffer, ensuring it maximizes my payoff relative to my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 5, 3]}\n```",

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of what it would be worth in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of what it would be worth in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am being offered [0, 2, 1, 5, 3]. This means I keep: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]. The value to me is: (1 * 57) + (0 * 68) + (0 * 47) + (1 * 41) + (1 * 62) = 57 + 0 + 0 + 41 + 62 = 160.\n   - This value (160) is significantly less than my outside offer (667).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the current offer is worth 160 to me, which is much less than my outside offer of 667, I should definitely not accept it.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer. I need to keep enough items to make the value greater than 667.\n\nLet's try keeping all the items for myself. My value would be: (1 * 57) + (2 * 68) + (1 * 47) + (6 * 41) + (4 * 62) = 57 + 136 + 47 + 246 + 248 = 734.\n\nSo, I can give away some items.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 667. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 825 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 1, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 1 + 68 x 1 + 47 x 1 + 41 x 6 + 62 x 4\n    which is 666 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 667. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 5, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 667\n*   My item values: item 1 = 57, item 2 = 68, item 3 = 47, item 4 = 41, item 5 = 62\n*   Total items: item 1 = 1, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 1, item 4 = 6, item 5 = 4\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 1, 2, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 2 = 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n    *   Item 4: 6 - 2 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    Value of current offer: (1 * 57) + (0 * 68) + (0 * 47) + (4 * 41) + (2 * 62) = 57 + 0 + 0 + 164 + 124 = 345\n*   Value of current offer * discount factor: 345 * 0.9 = 310.5\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (345) is much worse than my outside offer (667). The discounted value is even worse (310.5).\n\nNow, let's consider potential counteroffers. I need to ensure the value I retain is greater than 667.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items to me:\n(1 * 57) + (2 * 68) + (1 * 47) + (6 * 41) + (4 * 62) = 57 + 136 + 47 + 246 + 248 = 734\n\nTherefore, a counteroffer where Player 1 gets nothing would yield me a value of 734.\n\nLet's consider giving Player 1 one unit of item 5. That leaves me with 1 item 1, 2 item 2, 1 item 3, 6 item 4, and 3 item 5\nValue to me: (1 * 57) + (2 * 68) + (1 * 47) + (6 * 41) + (3 * 62) = 57 + 136 + 47 + 246 + 186 = 672\n\nNow, let's try an offer where I keep [1, 1, 1, 6, 4]\nValue: 57 x 1 + 68 x 1 + 47 x 1 + 41 x 6 + 62 x 4 = 57 + 68 + 47 + 246 + 248 = 666. This is worse than my outside offer.\nThe offer to Player 1 would be [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLet's try keeping all of item 1, item 2, item 3 and item 4, and giving Player 1 one unit of item 5. The offer to player 1 would be [0,0,0,0,1].\nValue to me would be (1 * 57) + (2 * 68) + (1 * 47) + (6 * 41) + (3 * 62) = 57 + 136 + 47 + 246 + 186 = 672. This is better than my outside offer of 667.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. I need to make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 a little something while still ensuring I get more than my outside offer value.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

This means I get 0 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5. My value for this offer is (0 * 57) + (0 * 68) + (0 * 47) + (1 * 41) + (1 * 62) = 103. Since this is round 3, the discounted value is 103 * (0.9)^(3-1) = 103 * 0.81 = 83.43. This is much lower than my outside offer of 667.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than or equal to 667. Let's see what I have if I keep everything: (1 * 57) + (2 * 68) + (1 * 47) + (6 * 41) + (4 * 62) = 57 + 136 + 47 + 246 + 248 = 734.\n\nSince this is the last round, making a counteroffer is equivalent to walking away. Therefore, I need to compare my outside offer with the current offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer yields a value of 83.43, which is significantly lower than my outside offer of 667.\n*   Walking away guarantees me 667.\n*   A counteroffer in the last round is equivalent to walking away.\n\nGiven that the discounted value of the current offer is much lower than my outside offer, and it's the last round, the optimal action is to WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 74 x 4 + 32 x 5 + 12 x 5\n    which is 516 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 517. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's go through the steps systematically:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 517\n- **Values of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 48\n  - Item 2: 76\n  - Item 3: 74\n  - Item 4: 32\n  - Item 5: 12\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 5 units\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 7 units\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor of 0.9 suggests that the value of the deal decreases over rounds. Therefore, it is beneficial to make decisions that are better than the outside offer sooner rather than later to maximize the discounted present value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n#### Counteroffer Analysis:\nTo start, let's avoid Mistake 2 by ensuring any counteroffer gives us a value higher than our outside offer of 517.\n\n#### Example Calculation:\n1. Keep [2, 2, 5, 4, 5] for ourselves (offering [3, 3, 1, 1, 2] to Player 2):\n   - Value calculation:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n     - 5 units of item 3 = 5 \u00d7 74 = 370\n     - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 32 = 128\n     - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 12 = 60\n   - Total value = 96 + 152 + 370 + 128 + 60 = 806\n\nThis offer ensures a value of 806 for us, which is notably higher than our outside offer of 517.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Accept the current offer?** No offer is currently on the table.\n- **Walk away?** It isn't advantageous since we can propose a counteroffer with higher value than the outside offer.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer?** Yes, I will propose an offer that brings us a value of 806.\n\n### Action\nGiven the analysis, the most sensible action is to make a counteroffer that provides us with a value higher than our outside option. Hence, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 1, 1, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 5, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 74 x 4 + 32 x 5 + 12 x 5\n    which is 516 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 517. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",

In round 2, the value of any outcome would be multiplied by gamma to the power of (2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) Assessing the value of offers:\n   - Value of accepting the current offer = 74 * 0.9 = 66.6 (adjusted by discount factor)\n   - My outside offer is worth 517, so accepting the current offer is worse than walking away, not reaching this minimal threshold.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I must ensure what I keep is worth more than 517. \n\n   Let's evaluate a potential counteroffer where I keep what's necessary to exceed my outside offer:\n\n   For example, if I offer [0, 0, 0, 3, 5], I keep [5, 5, 6, 2, 2]\n   - Value to me:\n     - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 48 = 240\n     - 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 76 = 380\n     - 6 units of item 3 = 6 \u00d7 74 = 444\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n   - Total = 1152\n\n   1152 is far greater than necessary to surpass the 517 mark.\n\n3) Making a decision:\n   - The current offer is significantly lower in value (66.6) than my outside offer (517), so accepting the current offer would mean accepting a loss.\n   - Walking away gives me my guaranteed fallback value of 517, which is better than the current offer.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer where I keep high-value items ensures I exceed my outside offer.\n\nGiven these considerations, I should propose a counteroffer to maximize my benefits beyond my outside offer. I'll propose the counteroffer that retains value above 517, optimizing my outcome:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 3, 5]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 0 + 51 x 2 + 85 x 0 + 84 x 0 + 35 x 2\n    which is 172 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 174.

I should refrain from proposing a division that results in less value than the outside offer.\n\n   Example division I could consider:\n\n   Offer: [0, 1, 1, 2, 2] (meaning Player 2 gets 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, etc.)\n   \n   Value to me:\n   - Item 1: 2 units (all) \u2192 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n   - Item 2: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n   - Item 3: 1 unit \u2192 1 \u00d7 85 = 85\n   - Item 4: 1 unit \u2192 1 \u00d7 84 = 84\n   - Item 5: 2 units \u2192 2 \u00d7 35 = 70\n\n   Total value = 28 + 102 + 85 + 84 + 70 = 369\n\n   This counteroffer should be greater than my outside offer of 174 and represents a good starting point for negotiation since it maximizes my value while leaving something on the table for the opponent.\n\n3. **Make a Decision**:\n   - I should propose a counteroffer because my calculated potential value (369) is much greater than my outside offer (174), adhering to the five highlighted mistakes criteria.\n\nHere is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 719\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 89, Item 3: 48, Item 4: 74, Item 5: 40\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 3, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]  (This is what Player 1 is offering *me*)\n    *   This means I would get:\n        *   Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n        *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n        *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n        *   Item 4: 3 - 2 = 1 unit\n        *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   My value for this offer is: (2 * 6) + (2 * 89) + (1 * 48) + (1 * 74) + (2 * 40) = 12 + 178 + 48 + 74 + 80 = 392\n    *   Since 392 < 719, accepting the current offer would be worse than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that gives me a value greater than 719. Let's start by considering keeping everything, and then offering small amounts of certain items. This is just an illustrative example, as keeping everything and giving nothing is Mistake 3.\n    *Keeping all items*:\n        *   Item 1: 2 * 6 = 12\n        *   Item 2: 3 * 89 = 267\n        *   Item 3: 2 * 48 = 96\n        *   Item 4: 3 * 74 = 222\n        *   Item 5: 4 * 40 = 160\n        *   Total: 12 + 267 + 96 + 222 + 160 = 757\n\nSince keeping all items is worth 757, let's try and create a valid counteroffer that gives Player 1 some items, but still yields me a value above my outside offer of 719. Item 2 has the highest value for me, so let's avoid giving that away. Let's try an offer of [1, 0, 1, 1, 2].\n\n* Counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 1, 2] (This is what I am offering Player 1)\n    * This means I would get:\n        * Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n        * Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n        * Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n        * Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n        * Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    * My value for this offer is: (1 * 6) + (3 * 89) + (1 * 48) + (2 * 74) + (2 * 40) = 6 + 267 + 48 + 148 + 80 = 549\n    * Since 549 < 719, this offer is not good for me\n\nLet's try another offer. I need to offer less in Item 4 and Item 5.\n\n* Counteroffer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] (This is what I am offering Player 1)\n    * This means I would get:\n        * Item 1: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n        * Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n        * Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n        * Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n        * Item 5: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n    * My value for this offer is: (1 * 6) + (3 * 89) + (2 * 48) + (3 * 74) + (4 * 40) = 6 + 267 + 96 + 222 + 160 = 751\n    * Since 751 > 719, this is a better offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 392, which is less than my outside offer of 719. The counteroffer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] is worth 751, which is greater than my outside offer of 719.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 0 + 51 x 2 + 85 x 0 + 84 x 0 + 35 x 2\n    which is 172 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 174. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value: 719\n   - Values of the items: item 1 = 6, item 2 = 89, item 3 = 48, item 4 = 74, item 5 = 40\n   - Total pool of items: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 4 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer earlier.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 1, 0, 1].  This means they are giving me 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n     - My value for this offer is: (0 * 6) + (2 * 89) + (1 * 48) + (0 * 74) + (1 * 40) = 0 + 178 + 48 + 0 + 40 = 266.\n\n     - Since this is round 2, if I accept this offer, my value is discounted by a factor of 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. Thus, my discounted value if I accept the current offer is 266 * 0.9 = 239.4.  This is much less than my outside offer of 719.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to ensure that the value of what I keep is greater than my outside offer of 719.\n\n     - Let's calculate the value of keeping all the items for myself:\n       (2 * 6) + (3 * 89) + (2 * 48) + (3 * 74) + (4 * 40) = 12 + 267 + 96 + 222 + 160 = 757.\n\n     - Now, let's try to find a division that is acceptable. I need to give enough to player 1 so that a deal is made. First, I must keep at least value 719, and then give them at least a little so they don't walk.\n    \n       I could try offering [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] to player 1. This means I keep [2, 3, 2, 2, 4].  My value is: (2*6) + (3*89) + (2*48) + (2*74) + (4*40) = 12 + 267 + 96 + 148 + 160 = 683. This is worse than my outside option.\n       \n       What about [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This gives me [2, 3, 2, 3, 3]. My value is 12+267+96+222+120=717. This is still worse than my outside option.\n\n       Let's try offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1. I keep [2, 3, 1, 3, 4]. My value is 12+267+48+222+160=709. This is worse than my outside option.\n\n       What if I offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]? This means I keep [2, 2, 2, 3, 4]. My value is: 12+178+96+222+160=668. Worse than my outside offer.\n\n       Offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Keep [1, 3, 2, 3, 4]. My value is 6+267+96+222+160=751.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - The current offer is very bad (239.4 < 719).\n   - I want to propose a counteroffer which gives me more than 719.\n   - I can offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] which gives me 751 > 719.\n\n   Since it is round 2, if the next round goes to the end, I get 0.9*Outside Offer.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 719. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 719. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 771 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 2, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 2 + 89 x 3 + 48 x 2 + 74 x 3 + 40 x 3\n    which is 717 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 719. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 3: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n    - My outside offer value: 748\n    - My item values: item 1 = 77, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 12, item 4 = 84, item 5 = 29\n    - Total items: 6 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 4 of item 5\n    - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - **Current offer:** I am being offered [2, 3, 0, 0, 1]. This means I keep:\n        - Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4\n        - Item 2: 5 - 3 = 2\n        - Item 3: 1 - 0 = 1\n        - Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n        - Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\n    My value if I accept the current offer:\n        (4 * 77) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 12) + (2 * 84) + (3 * 29) = 308 + 4 + 12 + 168 + 87 = 579\n    Comparing this to my outside offer, 579 < 748.\n    - Since the current offer gives me 579, which is less than my outside offer of 748, accepting would be a mistake.\n\n3) **Consider a potential counteroffer:** I need to ensure my counteroffer yields a value greater than 748. Let's explore some options:\n    - I will keep most of the item 4 because it has high value (84). And also item 1.\n\n    - **Trying to keep [6, 0, 0, 2, 0]:** The value is 6*77 + 0*2 + 0*12 + 2*84 + 0*29 = 462 + 168 = 630.  This is less than my outside offer. So not good.\n    - **Trying to keep [6, 0, 1, 2, 0]:** The value is 6*77 + 0*2 + 1*12 + 2*84 + 0*29 = 462 + 12 + 168 = 642. This is less than my outside offer.\n    - **Trying to keep [6, 0, 0, 2, 4]:** The value is 6*77 + 0*2 + 0*12 + 2*84 + 4*29 = 462 + 168 + 116 = 746. This is less than my outside offer.\n    - **Trying to keep [6, 0, 1, 2, 4]:** The value is 6*77 + 0*2 + 1*12 + 2*84 + 4*29 = 462 + 12 + 168 + 116 = 758. This is greater than my outside offer.\n\n    - This means giving the other player [0, 5, 0, 0, 0].\n    - **Trying a more even split focusing on item 1 and 4:**\n    - **Offer [3, 2, 0, 1, 2]:** This means I keep [3, 3, 1, 1, 2].\n    - My value: 3*77 + 3*2 + 1*12 + 1*84 + 2*29 = 231 + 6 + 12 + 84 + 58 = 391. This is less than my outside offer. So not good.\n\n    - **Walk is an option, but let's find a counteroffer:** I can try giving away minimal amounts of item 1 and 4:\n    **Trying to keep [5, 0, 1, 1, 4]:** This gives me a value of 5*77 + 0*2 + 1*12 + 1*84 + 4*29 = 385 + 12 + 84 + 116 = 597.\n\nBased on the above and aiming to get as much as possible above my walkaway I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 5, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 888. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 1, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 4 + 38 x 5 + 22 x 1 + 61 x 2 + 63 x 4\n    which is 886 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 888. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting the same offer in earlier rounds.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** [0, 2, 1, 1, 2] (items offered to me)\n    *   Item 1: 0 * 48 = 0\n    *   Item 2: 2 * 59 = 118\n    *   Item 3: 1 * 89 = 89\n    *   Item 4: 1 * 9 = 9\n    *   Item 5: 2 * 41 = 82\n    *   Total value of current offer = 0 + 118 + 89 + 9 + 82 = 298\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (298) is significantly less than my outside offer (611). Accepting would be Mistake 4.\n\nNow let's consider a potential counteroffer. My goal is to obtain a value greater than 611. Let's start by exploring a division where I keep a majority of the most valuable items (items 3, 2, 1). I want to calculate a potential counteroffer to Player 1. Let's aim for a split where I get a value exceeding my outside offer. Let's try offering Player 1 a smaller amount and see if it benefits me more.\n\nHere's a potential counteroffer where I give Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n*   **Items I keep:** Item 1: 2, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 4\n*   **Value of items I keep:**\n    *   Item 1: 2 * 48 = 96\n    *   Item 2: 4 * 59 = 236\n    *   Item 3: 2 * 89 = 178\n    *   Item 4: 2 * 9 = 18\n    *   Item 5: 4 * 41 = 164\n    *   Total value = 96 + 236 + 178 + 18 + 164 = 692\n\nThis counteroffer (692) is greater than my outside offer (611).\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable.  The counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] gives me a value higher than my outside offer. Therefore, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 611.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 48, item 2 = 59, item 3 = 89, item 4 = 9, item 5 = 41.\n*   Total pool of items: 3 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value to me. An offer in round 3 will be worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]. This means I would receive 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. My value for this offer is: (1 * 48) + (3 * 59) + (1 * 89) + (1 * 9) + (2 * 41) = 48 + 177 + 89 + 9 + 82 = 405.  Since this is round 2, the discounted value of this offer is 405 * 0.9 = 364.5. This is much less than my outside offer of 611.\n\n*   **Previous offer:** Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 2] in Round 1. This means I get 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. So the value of this offer to me is: (3 * 48) + (3 * 59) + (1 * 89) + (2 * 9) + (3 * 41) = 144 + 177 + 89 + 18 + 123 = 551. Since this offer was in round 1, we discount by 0.  The discounted value is 551 * 1 = 551 which is still lower than my outside offer.\n\n*   **My Round 1 Counteroffer:** I offered Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]. This means I kept 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. So the value of this offer to me is: (2 * 48) + (4 * 59) + (2 * 89) + (2 * 9) + (4 * 41) = 96 + 236 + 178 + 18 + 164 = 692.\n    The discounted value is 692 * 1 = 692, which is greater than my outside offer of 611.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer when discounted. Let's consider some possibilities:\n    * I keep [2, 4, 2, 2, 4]. My offer to player 1 would be [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] which would give me a value of (2*48)+(4*59)+(2*89)+(2*9)+(4*41)= 692 as before. Discounted value = 692 * 0.9 = 622.8.\n    * I keep [2, 5, 2, 3, 5]. My offer to player 1 would be [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] which would give me a value of (2*48)+(5*59)+(2*89)+(3*9)+(5*41)= 96+295+178+27+205 = 801. Discounted value = 801*0.9 = 720.9.\n    * I keep [3, 5, 2, 3, 5]. My offer to player 1 would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] which is Mistake 3.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is very bad, even worse than the previous offer. Accepting would be a Mistake 4. Walking away would not be wise, because the value is close to my outside offer.\nMy round 1 offer yields a discounted value of 622.8, which is better than my outside option. So, I should propose a counteroffer that is no worse than my round 1 offer. The counteroffer [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] gives me the most value so far.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 285. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 285. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 588 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 1 + 4 x 4 + 54 x 1 + 9 x 1 + 76 x 2\n    which is 284 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 285. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 727\n*   My item values: Item 1: 100, Item 2: 8, Item 3: 100, Item 4: 51, Item 5: 55\n*   Total items: Item 1: 4, Item 2: 1, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means any deal made in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and any deal made in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit, value = 1 * 100 = 100\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit, value = 1 * 8 = 8\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit, value = 1 * 100 = 100\n    *   Item 4: 1 unit, value = 1 * 51 = 51\n    *   Item 5: 1 unit, value = 1 * 55 = 55\n    *   Total value = 100 + 8 + 100 + 51 + 55 = 314.\n    *   Since it is round 1, the discount factor is 0.9^(1-1) = 1, so the value remains 314.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer (314) is significantly less than my outside offer (727). Therefore, accepting the current offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 727. I will start by calculating the value of keeping all the items for myself.\n\n    *   Item 1: 4 units, value = 4 * 100 = 400\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit, value = 1 * 8 = 8\n    *   Item 3: 4 units, value = 4 * 100 = 400\n    *   Item 4: 4 units, value = 4 * 51 = 204\n    *   Item 5: 5 units, value = 5 * 55 = 275\n    *   Total value = 400 + 8 + 400 + 204 + 275 = 1287\n\n    Since the total value is 1287, I can potentially give some items to Player 1 and still maintain a value greater than 727. I will start by offering player 1 a fairly small amount of the high value items and see how this compares.\n    I'll try offering Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then the total value to me is the value of all the items = 1287\n    If I offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 1], then I get to keep [3, 1, 3, 3, 4], and the value is 3*100 + 1*8 + 3*100 + 3*51 + 4*55 = 300 + 8 + 300 + 153 + 220 = 981\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is unacceptable. I need to make a counteroffer that benefits me more than my outside offer. A good starting point is to make a somewhat aggressive counteroffer that secures a larger share of the items for myself.\nI will counteroffer with [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 656. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 4 + 82 x 2 + 63 x 1 + 50 x 4 + 32 x 2\n    which is 655 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 656. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 656\n*   **My values of the items:** 41 for item 1, 82 for item 2, 63 for item 3, 50 for item 4, 32 for item 5.\n*   **Total pool of items:** 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in later rounds is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [2, 1, 2, 2, 2]. This means they are asking for: 6-2=4 of item 1, 2-1=1 of item 2, 6-2=4 of item 3, 6-2=4 of item 4 and 2-2=0 of item 5.  This means I get [2, 1, 2, 2, 2].\n    *   Value of current offer: (2 * 41) + (1 * 82) + (2 * 63) + (2 * 50) + (2 * 32) = 82 + 82 + 126 + 100 + 64 = 454\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 454 < 656. Accepting this offer would give me less value than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Consider potential counteroffers:**\n\nI need to find an offer (what I give to Player 1) that leaves me with a value greater than 656. Let's calculate my total possible value from all the items:\n(6 * 41) + (2 * 82) + (6 * 63) + (6 * 50) + (2 * 32) = 246 + 164 + 378 + 300 + 64 = 1152\n\nNow, let's try to keep different amounts for myself to exceed the outside offer. I need to give away a combination of items that will leave me with more than 656 value. My objective is to maximize my value. Let's start by thinking about giving the smallest possible offer:\nLet's say I offer nothing to player 1, so offer = [0,0,0,0,0]. This means I keep all the items and my value is 1152. This is better than my outside offer. The other extreme is giving player 1 everything which is the current opposite of what I have.\n\nTo construct a valid counteroffer, I must ensure the quantities offered sum to the total quantities available.\n\nGiven the current round and the current offer, and that the value of the current offer is less than the outside offer, I want to propose a counteroffer. I should offer a more even split of the resources that would be beneficial for me.\n\nFor a simple offer let's try offering player 1 exactly half of what is available, rounding if needed (or even 0 if half is fractional).\nitem 1: 6 units / 2 = 3 units\nitem 2: 2 units / 2 = 1 unit\nitem 3: 6 units / 2 = 3 units\nitem 4: 6 units / 2 = 3 units\nitem 5: 2 units / 2 = 1 unit\nCounteroffer = [3, 1, 3, 3, 1]\n\nValue to me if I propose the counteroffer [3, 1, 3, 3, 1]:\n\nI keep:\nitem 1: 6 - 3 = 3\nitem 2: 2 - 1 = 1\nitem 3: 6 - 3 = 3\nitem 4: 6 - 3 = 3\nitem 5: 2 - 1 = 1\n\nMy value = (3 * 41) + (1 * 82) + (3 * 63) + (3 * 50) + (1 * 32) = 123 + 82 + 189 + 150 + 32 = 576.\n576 < 656\n\nNow to propose an alternative one, where I get more. Let's offer to player 1 only: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0].\nI keep:\nitem 1: 6 - 1 = 5\nitem 2: 2 - 0 = 2\nitem 3: 6 - 1 = 5\nitem 4: 6 - 1 = 5\nitem 5: 2 - 0 = 2\n\nMy value = (5 * 41) + (2 * 82) + (5 * 63) + (5 * 50) + (2 * 32) = 205 + 164 + 315 + 250 + 64 = 998. 998 > 656\n\n4) **Make a decision:**\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept. I've computed the value of my outside offer.\nSince I computed that if I offer the counteroffer [1, 0, 1, 1, 0], my value is greater than the outside offer, this is a reasonable option.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 3 + 56 x 2 + 78 x 0 + 98 x 0 + 10 x 2\n    which is 261 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 262. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 433. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1017 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 433\n*   **Values of the items:**\n    *   Item 1: 44\n    *   Item 2: 97\n    *   Item 3: 97\n    *   Item 4: 79\n    *   Item 5: 22\n*   **Total pool of items:**\n    *   Item 1: 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 0 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 units\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer in round 2 gives me 0.9 times the value of that offer, and round 3 would give me 0.9^2 times the value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This means I would receive:\n    *   1 unit of item 1: 1 * 44 = 44\n    *   1 unit of item 2: 1 * 97 = 97\n    *   1 unit of item 3: 1 * 97 = 97\n    *   0 units of item 4: 0 * 79 = 0\n    *   0 units of item 5: 0 * 22 = 0\n    *   Total value: 44 + 97 + 97 + 0 + 0 = 238\n    *   Discounted value: 238 * 0.9 = 214.2\n    *   This value is significantly lower than my outside offer of 433, so I should not accept this offer.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider offers that give me a value greater than 433.  Let's consider a few scenarios.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** Keep all items. The value is 3*44 + 2*97 + 3*97 + 0*79 + 3*22 = 132 + 194 + 291 + 0 + 66 = 683. If I keep everything, the other player gets nothing, which is generally not a good strategy.\n    *   **Scenario 2:** Give Player 1 only 1 unit of Item 5, keeping the rest. The offer would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. My value would be 683 - 22 = 661.\n    *   **Scenario 3:** Give Player 1 1 unit each of items 1, 2, and 3, keeping the rest. This is the current offer from Player 1.\n    *   **Scenario 4:** A more \"fair\" split. The total value is 683. If the other player has a smaller value than I do, they should get less items than me.\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** I need to find a counteroffer that, when discounted, is greater than 433. If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], the discounted value is 661 * 0.9 = 594.9, so it's a valid counteroffer. Let's explore other counteroffers.\n\n    *   Offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]. This means I keep [2, 2, 3, 0, 2]. Value = 2*44 + 2*97 + 3*97 + 0*79 + 2*22 = 88 + 194 + 291 + 0 + 44 = 617. Discounted value = 617*0.9 = 555.3\n    *   Offer Player 1 [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. This means I keep [2, 1, 3, 0, 2]. Value = 2*44 + 1*97 + 3*97 + 0*79 + 2*22 = 88 + 97 + 291 + 0 + 44 = 520. Discounted value = 520*0.9 = 468\n    *   Offer Player 1 [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]. This means I keep [2, 1, 2, 0, 2]. Value = 2*44 + 1*97 + 2*97 + 0*79 + 2*22 = 88 + 97 + 194 + 0 + 44 = 423. Discounted value = 423 * 0.9 = 380.7 < 433.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is bad (214.2 < 433), and the value to me is 683, so let's try a different approach. Let's offer something to the player so that I get a good value from it. My strategy is to offer the least valuable item to the player and keep all other items.\n\nOffering [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] to the player 1 will result in me keeping the rest. That means my value is equal to 683 - (1 * 22) = 661. Discounted value in round 2 is 661 * 0.9 = 594.9. This is greater than 433.\n\nOffering [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to the player 1 will result in me keeping the rest. That means my value is equal to 683 - (1 * 44) = 639. Discounted value in round 2 is 639 * 0.9 = 575.1. This is also greater than 433.\n\nOffering [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] to the player 1 will result in me keeping the rest. That means my value is equal to 683 - (1 * 97) = 586. Discounted value in round 2 is 586 * 0.9 = 527.4. This is also greater than 433.\n\nOffering [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] to the player 1 will result in me keeping the rest. That means my value is equal to 683 - (1 * 97) = 586. Discounted value in round 2 is 586 * 0.9 = 527.4. This is also greater than 433.\n\nConsidering the above options I will select the offer that will benefit me the most which is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 396. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 396. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 456 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 3 + 20 x 2 + 26 x 2 + 6 x 0 + 68 x 3\n    which is 392 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 396. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 244. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    99 x 0 + 25 x 0 + 66 x 1 + 63 x 0 + 59 x 3\n    which is 243 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 244. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 244.\n*   My item values are: item 1 = 99, item 2 = 25, item 3 = 66, item 4 = 63, item 5 = 59.\n*   The total pool of items is: 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 1, 0, 2, 0].  This means I get 1 unit of item 2 and 2 units of item 4.\n    My value for this offer is (1 * 25) + (2 * 63) = 25 + 126 = 151.\n    Since 151 is less than my outside offer of 244, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 244.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 only 1 unit of item 1.\nMy value for that offer:\n(6 * 99) + (3 * 25) + (2 * 66) + (5 * 63) + (5 * 59)\n= 594 + 75 + 132 + 315 + 295 = 1411\nwhich is much greater than my outside option.\nI am offering [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1 only 2 units of item 1.\nMy value for that offer:\n(5 * 99) + (3 * 25) + (2 * 66) + (5 * 63) + (5 * 59)\n= 495 + 75 + 132 + 315 + 295 = 1312\nwhich is still much greater than my outside option.\nI am offering [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\nLet's consider a counteroffer where I offer Player 1: [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]. This seems more fair than giving away less than 2 units of items 1.\nI would get to keep:\n5 units of item 1\n2 units of item 2\n1 units of item 3\n3 units of item 4\n3 units of item 5\n5 * 99 + 2 * 25 + 1 * 66 + 3 * 63 + 3 * 59\n= 495 + 50 + 66 + 189 + 177\n= 977 which is a lot more than 244.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worth 151 to me, which is less than my outside offer of 244. Therefore, I should not accept.\n*   I will make a counteroffer.  I will offer [2, 1, 1, 2, 2] to player 1.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 244\n*   My item values: item 1 = 99, item 2 = 25, item 3 = 66, item 4 = 63, item 5 = 59\n*   Total items: 7 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 5 of item 5\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means accepting an offer now is worth more than the same offer next round because of the time value of money (or, in this case, the present value of negotiation).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [6, 1, 1, 3, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 7 - 6 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n\n    Value of current offer to me: (1 * 99) + (2 * 25) + (1 * 66) + (2 * 63) + (3 * 59) = 99 + 50 + 66 + 126 + 177 = 518\n\n    Since 518 > 244, accepting the current offer is better than walking away immediately.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider if a counteroffer is better than accepting the current offer, taking into account the discount factor.\n\n    If I accept now, my value is 518. If I make a counteroffer and it gets accepted next round (round 3), my value would be 0.9 * (value of accepted offer). If I walk away after my counteroffer is rejected, my value is 244.\n    \n    Consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 [7, 2, 1, 5, 4]. Then I would get [0, 1, 1, 0, 1], so my value is:\n    (0 * 99) + (1 * 25) + (1 * 66) + (0 * 63) + (1 * 59) = 25 + 66 + 59 = 150\n    150 * 0.9 = 135. This is less than my outside offer of 244, so it is not worth offering.\n    \n    Consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 [5, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then I would get [2, 3, 2, 5, 5], so my value is:\n    (2 * 99) + (3 * 25) + (2 * 66) + (5 * 63) + (5 * 59) = 198 + 75 + 132 + 315 + 295 = 1015\n    1015 * 0.9 = 913.5. This is greater than accepting the current offer.\n    \n    Since it's round 2, if I make a counteroffer it will be a WALK anyway, because the game ends on round 3 if Player 2 makes a counteroffer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 518 to me, which is greater than my outside offer of 244. Since any counteroffer I make will be treated as a WALK, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 0 + 67 x 4 + 42 x 0 + 62 x 1 + 93 x 0\n    which is 330 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 331. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

I need to keep enough items to make that happen.\n    Let's start by keeping everything and then giving away small amounts to Player 1.\n\n    Let's try keeping:\n    *   2 units of item 1\n    *   4 units of item 2\n    *   4 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   3 units of item 5\n    This means offering Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

So the offer is [1, 2, 2, 0, 1].\n    *   That means I keep one unit of item 1, two units of item 2, two units of item 3, one unit of item 4 and two units of item 5. My value would be (1 * 57) + (2 * 37) + (2 * 42) + (1 * 70) + (2 * 92) = 57 + 74 + 84 + 70 + 184 = 469. This is significantly less than my outside offer.\n\n    To get a value above 709, I will make an offer such that I offer only small amounts of the items to the other agent. \n\n    Let me offer the other agent [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n    This leaves me with [2, 3, 3, 1, 3].\n\n    My value is (2 * 57) + (3 * 37) + (3 * 42) + (1 * 70) + (3 * 92) = 114 + 111 + 126 + 70 + 276 = 697.\n    This is less than 709. So it will not work.\n\n    Let me offer the other agent [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n    This leaves me with [2, 4, 3, 1, 3].\n\n    My value is (2 * 57) + (4 * 37) + (3 * 42) + (1 * 70) + (3 * 92) = 114 + 148 + 126 + 70 + 276 = 734.\n    This is greater than 709.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 331. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 846 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 0 + 67 x 4 + 42 x 0 + 62 x 1 + 93 x 0\n    which is 330 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 331. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

We need the value of the items I keep to be greater than 85.\n\n  #### Scenario: Proposal [0, 0, 1, 3, 3] (meaning I give away 3 units of Item 1 and keep the rest):\n  - Item 1: 0 units = 0 \u00d7 11 = 0\n  - Item 2: 0 units = 0 \u00d7 97 = 0\n  - Item 3: 1 units = 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n  - Item 4: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n  - Item 5: 3 units = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - Total value to me = 0 + 0 + 28 + 72 + 15 = 115, which is higher than 85.\n\nThis keeps my total value of kept items above the outside offer (115 vs. 85).\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n \n- Accept?

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 1 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 98 for item 1, 2 for item 2, 53 for item 3, 45 for item 4, 70 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 800. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 787. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 787. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 1, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 3 + 2 x 1 + 53 x 3 + 45 x 2 + 70 x 3\n    which is 755 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 787. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 270. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 0 + 28 x 1 + 73 x 1 + 13 x 3 + 43 x 3\n    which is 269 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 270. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

The discount factor will influence the value of future offers.\n\n2.  **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\n    *   Current offer to me: [0, 2, 2, 3, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me 0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    *   My value if I accept: (0 \\* 17) + (2 \\* 93) + (2 \\* 88) + (3 \\* 87) + (0 \\* 55) = 0 + 186 + 176 + 261 + 0 = 623\n\n    Since 623 is greater than my outside offer of 86, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *if* Player 1 will follow through on the ACCEPT. However, there is likely a better offer for me.\n\n3. **Assess potential counteroffers:**\n\nTo avoid Mistake 3 (Offering no items or all items), a good starting point is to aim for a more even distribution of items, keeping in mind my higher values for items 2, 3, and 4. To avoid Mistake 2 (Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer), I need to ensure my remaining items are worth at least 86. Also, I should avoid Mistake 1 (Making an offer worse than your previous offer).\n\nLet's try a counteroffer that is more balanced. I currently have 4 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. The player 1 has [0, 2, 2, 3, 0].\nTotal units of each item are 4, 2, 2, 3, 4\n\nCounteroffer: [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nThis leaves me with:\n(4-2) item 1 = 2\n(2-1) item 2 = 1\n(2-1) item 3 = 1\n(3-2) item 4 = 1\n(4-2) item 5 = 2\n\nValue: 2 * 17 + 1 * 93 + 1 * 88 + 1 * 87 + 2 * 55 = 34 + 93 + 88 + 87 + 110 = 412\n412 > 86, so this is valid.\nThis likely increases Player 1's value, because they are receiving items 2,3, and 4, which they value much less.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is good, but probably not the best I can get, and this offer is greater than my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    17 x 1 + 93 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 87 x 0 + 55 x 1\n    which is 72 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 86. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 2, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 0, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the current situation and determine the best action for Player 2.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 86\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 17, Item 2: 93, Item 3: 88, Item 4: 87, Item 5: 55\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 2, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9.  This means that accepting a deal in round 2 yields 0.9 times the value of the items, and in round 3 it yields 0.81 times the value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 0, 0, 3, 2]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 0 units\n    *   Item 3: 0 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 2 units\n    My value for this offer is: (1 * 17) + (0 * 93) + (0 * 88) + (3 * 87) + (2 * 55) = 17 + 0 + 0 + 261 + 110 = 388\n    Since this is round 2, the discounted value is 388 * 0.9 = 349.2\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 349.2 > 86. Accepting the current offer is significantly better than walking away.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Let's consider a few potential counteroffers to ensure we're not leaving value on the table. Remember that if the game goes to round 3, the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by 0.81. If I make a counteroffer in round 3 it is treated as a WALK. So making a very aggressive offer might lead to a better outcome.\n\n    Since item 2 and item 3 have the highest value for me (93, 88) it would make sense to get those items.\n    I would want to keep 2 units of item 2 and 2 units of item 3. And try to get as much of item 4 and 5 as I can. Item 1 has the lowest value for me.\n\n    What if I offered [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]?  This means I keep 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.  This is worth (1 * 17) + (2 * 93) + (2 * 88) + (3 * 87) + (4 * 55) = 17 + 186 + 176 + 261 + 220 = 860\n    With the discount it would be 860*0.9 = 774\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nAccepting the current offer yields a discounted value of 349.2. Making a counteroffer of [3, 0, 0, 0, 0] yields a discounted value of 774. I should make the counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

However, in this round, the discount factor hasn't impacted yet.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to evaluate.\n   - For potential counteroffers, I need to determine a division that provides a total value greater than my outside offer value of 2276.\n\n   To maximize my value, I need to keep a significant number of high-value items.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 428. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 399 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 5, 6, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    41 x 0 + 8 x 5 + 63 x 5 + 12 x 6 + 9 x 0\n    which is 427 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 428. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 5, 2, 4, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 5, 2, 4, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

I currently have: Item 1: 4, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 7, Item 5: 3.\n   - If I reject Player 1's offer, I will keep 4 - 1 = 3 units of item 1, 7 - 5 = 2 units of item 2, 5 - 2 = 3 units of item 3, 7 - 4 = 3 units of item 4, 3 - 2 = 1 unit of item 5.

The corresponding values are: 3*41 + 2*8 + 3*63 + 3*12 + 1*9 = 123 + 16 + 189 + 36 + 9 = 373\n   - My value if I reject the current offer and make no counteroffer: 373\n   - My target for a beneficial outcome: 428.\n\nI should make a counteroffer.

This means I would get:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n    *   Item 2: 7 - 6 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 0 = 5 units\n    *   Item 4: 7 - 3 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n\n    Total value of current offer: (4 \\* 41) + (1 \\* 8) + (5 \\* 63) + (4 \\* 12) + (2 \\* 9) = 164 + 8 + 315 + 48 + 18 = 553\n\n    Since it is round 2, the discounted value of the current offer is 553 * 0.9^(2-1) = 553 * 0.9 = 497.7\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The discounted value of the current offer (497.7) is greater than my outside offer (428). Therefore, accepting the current offer is better than walking away right now.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Now, let's consider some possible counteroffers. Since I want to maximize my value, I need to give away as little as possible while still enticing Player 1 to accept. It needs to be better than their outside offer.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1:** Offering slightly more than Player 1 initially offered in round 1: [1, 6, 1, 3, 1]\n        I would get [3, 1, 4, 4, 2]\n        My value would be: (3 \\* 41) + (1 \\* 8) + (4 \\* 63) + (4 \\* 12) + (2 \\* 9) = 123 + 8 + 252 + 48 + 18 = 449\n        Discounted value: 449 * 0.9 = 404.1 This is less than the current discounted value of 497.7\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 2:** Lets try offering the original round 1 offer: [1, 4, 1, 1, 2]\n        I would get [3, 3, 4, 6, 1]\n        My value would be: (3 \\* 41) + (3 \\* 8) + (4 \\* 63) + (6 \\* 12) + (1 \\* 9) = 123 + 24 + 252 + 72 + 9 = 480\n        Discounted value: 480 * 0.9 = 432 This is still less than the current discounted value of 497.7\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer is higher than my outside offer and also higher than possible counter offers that I have considered, I should accept the current offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 345. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 717 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 345\n- **Values of the Items to Me:**\n  - Item 1: 65\n  - Item 2: 12\n  - Item 3: 32\n  - Item 4: 78\n  - Item 5: 52\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 6 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 6 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** We are in round 2. Since the discount factor gamma = 0.9, if this offer goes to another round, the value to each player will be multiplied by gamma^(r-1), which is gamma^1 = 0.9.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Current Offer to Me: [2, 3, 2, 3, 1]\n- My value from this offer:\n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n  - Item 2: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n  - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n- Total value if I accept = 130 + 36 + 64 + 234 + 52 = 516\n- Discounted value = 516 \u00d7 0.9 = 464.4\n\n#### Comparing Values\n- My outside offer is 345. Currently, 464.4 is greater than 345. Thus, accepting the current offer is better than walking away.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n- Mistake avoidance:\n  - **Mistake 4:** This is accepting an offer worse than the outside offer. The current offer (464.4) is better than my outside offer (345).\n  - **Mistake 5:** Walking away when better offers exist. The current offer yields a higher payoff than my fallback outside offer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best decision is to accept the current offer, as it provides a higher value than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",
