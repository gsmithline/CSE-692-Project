Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 565. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 565. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 603 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 6, 1, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 2 + 8 x 6 + 18 x 1 + 76 x 3 + 72 x 3\n    which is 564 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 565. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

An offer in round 3 is worth 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 3]. This means I would receive 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5. Player 2 would receive the rest. My valuation of this offer is:\n    *   0 * 27 + 0 * 8 + 0 * 18 + 1 * 76 + 3 * 72 = 76 + 216 = 292.\n    *   Discounted value: 292 * 0.9 = 262.8. This is much less than my outside offer of 565.\n\n*   **Round 1 Offer:** Player 1 (me) offered [1, 3, 1, 0, 0] in round 1. This means player 2 receives 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. I would keep: 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5. My valuation would have been:\n    * 3 * 27 + 3 * 8 + 2 * 18 + 3 * 76 + 3 * 72 = 81 + 24 + 36 + 228 + 216 = 585\n    * Discounted value: 585 * 1 = 585.\n\n*   **Consider a different offer:** Let's say I offer Player 2 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]. I keep 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5. My valuation would be: 4 * 27 + 4 * 8 + 3 * 18 + 3 * 76 + 3 * 72 = 108 + 32 + 54 + 228 + 216 = 638. Discounted value 638 * 0.9 = 574.2\nThis is higher than my outside offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n\nThe current offer is terrible. Accepting would give me a discounted value of only 262.8, which is far below my outside offer of 565.\nWalking away gives me 565.\nMaking a counteroffer of [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] yields a discounted value of 574.2, which is higher than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make a counteroffer of [0, 2, 0, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1322. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1322. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1023 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 6, 3, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 4 + 90 x 6 + 52 x 3 + 75 x 3 + 24 x 0\n    which is 1321 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1322. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's keep all of items 1 and 2 to start with and adjust the rest.\n\n- Proposal: Give away [0, 0, 1, 3, 3].

I need to keep reevaluating the division. \n\nIf I keep [4, 6, 2, 3, 3], then I offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]:\n\nThe value of this:\n  - 4 units of item 1 \u00d7 100 = 400\n  - 6 units of item 2 \u00d7 90 = 540\n  - 2 units of item 3 \u00d7 52 = 104\n  - 3 units of item 4 \u00d7 75 = 225\n  - 3 units of item 5 \u00d7 24 = 72\n\n  - **Total value**: 1341\n\nDiscounted by gamma:\n  - 0.9 \u00d7 1341 = 1206.9\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer, suggesting the benefit of walking.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1128. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1140 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 5, 1, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    90 x 3 + 90 x 5 + 92 x 1 + 99 x 3 + 9 x 2\n    which is 1127 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1128. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 124. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 873 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party.

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer.\n   - I need to formulate a counteroffer. To avoid mistake 2, my offer must yield me a value greater than my outside offer of 414.\n\nLet's consider a possible counteroffer where I keep the following: 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 and offer the rest to player 2.\nThat means I'm offering player 2: 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5.\nThe value of this to me would be:\n2 * 72 + 3 * 42 + 2 * 17 + 2 * 29 + 1 * 91 = 144 + 126 + 34 + 58 + 91 = 453.\n\nThis is greater than 414.\n\nLet's try another offer, giving the other player more. Say I offer Player 2 half of everything.\nThat means I offer Player 2 2 units of item 1, 2.5 units of item 2, 1.5 units of item 3, 1.5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5. Since we can only deal with integer units, I will change the 2.5 to 2 and give myself the extra unit.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 414. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 753 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 42 x 4 + 17 x 2 + 29 x 1 + 91 x 2\n    which is 413 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 414. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 414\n*   **My item values:** item 1: 72, item 2: 42, item 3: 17, item 4: 29, item 5: 91\n*   **Total items:** 4 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 2 is offering me [1, 3, 0, 0, 1]. This means I would get:\n    *   1 unit of item 1\n    *   3 units of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   0 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    * My total value for this offer is (1 * 72) + (3 * 42) + (0 * 17) + (0 * 29) + (1 * 91) = 72 + 126 + 0 + 0 + 91 = 289.  Since this is round 2, we need to discount this value by 0.9: 289 * 0.9 = 260.1\n    *   Compared to my outside offer of 414, this is much worse (260.1 < 414). Therefore, accepting this is not a good idea.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to construct a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer, considering the discount factor. Let's aim to make an offer that leaves me with a value of at least 414 / 0.9 = 460 at the start of the round.\n\n    *   Before constructing a counteroffer, let's quickly assess the previous offer made by Player 1 [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]. This means Player 1 would keep:\n        *   2 units of item 1\n        *   3 units of item 2\n        *   2 units of item 3\n        *   2 units of item 4\n        *   1 unit of item 5\n        *   My total value for this offer is (2 * 72) + (3 * 42) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 29) + (1 * 91) = 144 + 126 + 34 + 58 + 91 = 453.  Discounted, this value is 453 * 0.9 = 407.7, which is worse than my outside offer. This confirms that Player 1's first offer was a mistake, as it would leave them worse off than walking away.\n    *   Let's see if I can find a split better than my outside offer, discounted.\n        * keeping [4, 5, 3, 3, 2] would be my optimal amount and has a value of 818. Discounted, that value is 736.2. Since my outside offer is less than that, then I can offer the other agent some items.\n        * Keeping [2, 3, 1, 1, 1] would give me (2 * 72) + (3 * 42) + (1 * 17) + (1 * 29) + (1 * 91) = 144 + 126 + 17 + 29 + 91 = 407. This is not good, so the offer to them would be [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n        * Keeping [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] would give me (1 * 72) + (2 * 42) + (1 * 17) + (1 * 29) + (1 * 91) = 72 + 84 + 17 + 29 + 91 = 293.\n        * Keeping [3, 4, 2, 2, 1] would give me (3 * 72) + (4 * 42) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 29) + (1 * 91) = 216 + 168 + 34 + 58 + 91 = 567, or 510.3 with discounting. This is a promising option.\n        * So offering them [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] seems reasonable.\n\n**3) Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n*   A counteroffer of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] results in a discounted value above my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 414. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 753 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 2, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 0 + 42 x 4 + 17 x 2 + 29 x 1 + 91 x 2\n    which is 413 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 414. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 3, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best action for Player 1 in Round 3.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   *   My outside offer value: 414\n   *   My item values: Item 1 = 72, Item 2 = 42, Item 3 = 17, Item 4 = 29, Item 5 = 91\n   *   Total items: 4 units of Item 1, 5 units of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 3 units of Item 4, 2 units of Item 5\n   *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9\n   *   Current offer on the table: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (what Player 2 is offering me)\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   *   **Current offer (ACCEPT):** I receive [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This means Player 2 gets:\n        *   Item 1: 4 - 1 = 3\n        *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n        *   Item 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n        *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2\n        *   Item 5: 2 - 1 = 1\n        My value from accepting the current offer is: (1 * 72) + (1 * 42) + (1 * 17) + (1 * 29) + (1 * 91) = 251. Since this is round 3, we need to discount this by (0.9)^(3-1) = 0.81.  So the discounted value is 251 * 0.81 = 203.31\n   *   **WALK:** My value is my outside offer of 414, discounted by (0.9)^2 = 0.81, resulting in 414 * 0.81 = 335.34\n\n   *   **Counteroffers:** Since this is the last round, any counteroffer from Player 2 will be treated as a WALK. I need to make sure that the amount I keep in my counteroffer is worth at least 414 / 0.81 = 511.11 to make it better than walking away.\n        *   My total value of all the items is (4 * 72) + (5 * 42) + (3 * 17) + (3 * 29) + (2 * 91) = 288 + 210 + 51 + 87 + 182 = 818\n\n        Let's consider a counteroffer. I need to keep enough items such that their value is greater than 511.11 to be better than walking away.\n        *   If I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I keep all items, my value is 818. This is way better than my discounted outside offer.\n        *   If I offer [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], meaning I keep [4, 4, 3, 3, 2], my value is (4 * 72) + (4 * 42) + (3 * 17) + (3 * 29) + (2 * 91) = 288 + 168 + 51 + 87 + 182 = 776. This is better than my discounted outside offer.\n        *   If I offer [1, 2, 1, 1, 1], meaning I keep [3, 3, 2, 2, 1], my value is (3 * 72) + (3 * 42) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 29) + (1 * 91) = 216 + 126 + 34 + 58 + 91 = 525. This is also better than my discounted outside offer.\n\n3.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    *   Accepting the current offer gives me a discounted value of 203.31.\n    *   Walking away gives me a discounted value of 335.34.\n    *   A counteroffer like [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] yields a value of 525, which is higher than walking away and higher than accepting.\n\nTherefore, I should make a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means waiting for a later round reduces the value of any deal.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer, so there's nothing to accept.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:**  I need to figure out a counteroffer that is better than my outside option and potentially attractive to Player 2. I want to keep as much of the valuable items (1, 2, and 3) as possible, while offering enough to entice Player 2.\n\n3) **Making a decision:**\nSince there is no offer to accept, I have a choice between making an offer and walking away. I don't want to walk away immediately since I'm in round 1 and I have a chance to negotiate a better outcome. I want to find an initial offer that's reasonably fair and better than my outside offer if I kept the remaining items for myself. I need to calculate the value of potential offers for myself before committing to one.\n\nLet's start by considering giving half of each item to Player 2, which is a good starting point. Since we can't split items we'll have to round.\n* Item 1: offer 2, keep 3, Value = 3 * 65 = 195\n* Item 2: offer 3, keep 4, Value = 4 * 54 = 216\n* Item 3: offer 1, keep 1, Value = 1 * 88 = 88\n* Item 4: offer 2, keep 2, Value = 2 * 1 = 2\n* Item 5: offer 0, keep 0, Value = 0 * 28 = 0\n* Total value = 195 + 216 + 88 + 2 + 0 = 501\nThis looks good as it is greater than my outside offer of 374 and is a reasonable initial offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 3, 1, 2, 0]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 0 + 87 x 7 + 57 x 2 + 82 x 3 + 89 x 0\n    which is 969 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 971. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 7, 2, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    54 x 0 + 87 x 7 + 57 x 2 + 82 x 3 + 89 x 0\n    which is 969 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 971. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To make an informed decision, I will follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 971.\n   - My values per unit for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 54\n     - Item 2: 87\n     - Item 3: 57\n     - Item 4: 82\n     - Item 5: 89\n   - The total pool of items is [5, 7, 2, 4, 0].\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) means that if an outcome is reached in this round (round 2), the value is multiplied by 0.9. However, comparing values achieved now with the outside offer doesn't need gamma adjustment since the outside offer is unaffected by the discount.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer to me: [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n     - Value for me = 1\u00d754 + 2\u00d787 + 0\u00d757 + 2\u00d782 + 0\u00d789 = 54 + 174 + 0 + 164 + 0 = 392\n   - Compare 392 to my outside offer of 971. The current offer is significantly less valuable than my outside offer.\n   \n   Assessing potential counteroffers:\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer where the remaining items are worth more than 971 to me.\n   - Example potential offer: giving the other player [2, 3, 1, 0, 0], keeping [3, 4, 1, 4, 0] for myself:\n     - Value = 3\u00d754 + 4\u00d787 + 1\u00d757 + 4\u00d782 + 0\u00d789\n     - Value = 162 + 348 + 57 + 328 + 0 = 895\n     - 895 is still less than 971, so I need to adjust further.\n\n   Another example offer: giving the other player [4, 3, 0, 0, 0], keeping [1, 4, 2, 4, 0] for myself:\n     - Value = 1\u00d754 + 4\u00d787 + 2\u00d757 + 4\u00d782 + 0\u00d789\n     - Value = 54 + 348 + 114 + 328 + 0 = 844\n     - 844 is still less than 971.\n\n   I'll try another offer to maximize my gain:\n   - Give the other player [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], keeping [3, 5, 2, 4, 0] for myself:\n     - Value = 3\u00d754 + 5\u00d787 + 2\u00d757 + 4\u00d782 + 0\u00d789\n     - Value = 162 + 435 + 114 + 328 + 0 = 1039\n     - 1039 is greater than my outside offer of 971.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - The current offer's value (392) is less than my outside offer (971), so I should not accept it.\n   - Walking away gives me 971, but creating a counteroffer that gives me 1039 is better.\n   - Propose a counteroffer where I keep enough value to exceed my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, my decision is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

To avoid mistake 3, I should not offer all the items or no items.\n*   Let's try to offer a \"fair\" split initially, something that gives both players a reasonable amount, and see how the other player responds. We know that the maximum combined value is unknown since the other player's values are private.\n*   I am going to offer Player 2 the following \\[2, 1, 1, 1, 2].

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 0 + 40 x 3 + 35 x 2 + 4 x 0 + 60 x 3\n    which is 370 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 372. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

The current offer yields a value of 219, which is significantly lower than my outside offer.\n   \n   - Exploring potential counteroffers: Let's evaluate what could be better than walking away:\n     - If I keep all items: \n       - Value = 4\u00d710 + 3\u00d740 + 2\u00d735 + 2\u00d74 + 4\u00d760 = 40 + 120 + 70 + 8 + 240 = 478\n     - To propose a valid counteroffer, it should be better than my outside offer of 372.\n\n     A counteroffer where I can maintain a value greater than 372 could be dividing items as follows:\n     - I keep 1 unit of item 1, 2 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 3 of item 5 (giving away [3, 1, 0, 1, 1])\n     - My value: \n       - 1 \u00d7 10 + 2 \u00d7 40 + 2 \u00d7 35 + 1 \u00d7 4 + 3 \u00d7 60 = 10 + 80 + 70 + 4 + 180 = 344\n\n   Unfortunately, even this counteroffer offers a value below my outside offer, and adjusting to give less still to bring it above 372 is unsuccessful within reasonable bounds of negotiation.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer (219) is worse than my outside offer (372).\n   - After assessing typical counteroffers, I can't find a reasonable division better than my outside offer.\n   \nTherefore, my action will be to walk away from the negotiation since the offers and potential counteroffers do not meet my outside offer value.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1227. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 756 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 4, 6, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1227\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 61, Item 2: 66, Item 3: 100, Item 4: 9, Item 5: 16\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 7, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 1, Item 5: 4\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 2]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 2 = 4\n    *   Item 2: 7 - 1 = 6\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 0 = 6\n    *   Item 4: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n\n    Value of current offer to me:\n    (4 * 61) + (6 * 66) + (6 * 100) + (1 * 9) + (2 * 16) = 244 + 396 + 600 + 9 + 32 = 1281\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer's value (1281) is greater than my outside offer (1227).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is better than my outside offer. Therefore, accepting is a reasonable option.\n*   However, it's round 2, so I could try to get a better deal. The discount factor is 0.9, so if I get a slightly better deal in round 3, it might be worth it.\n*   Let's consider a counteroffer. I want to give the other player as little as possible while still making it reasonable for them to accept. Let's try offering the other player [3, 2, 0, 0, 3] in the counteroffer. This translates to:\n    *   Item 1: I keep 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: I keep 7 - 2 = 5 units\n    *   Item 3: I keep 6 - 0 = 6 units\n    *   Item 4: I keep 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: I keep 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n\nValue of this potential counteroffer to me: (3 * 61) + (5 * 66) + (6 * 100) + (1 * 9) + (1 * 16) = 183 + 330 + 600 + 9 + 16 = 1138. This offer is worse than my outside offer so is not a good option.\n\nLet's propose an offer that is only slightly better than my walk away amount after taking into account the discount factor.\nCurrent offer I have a value of 1281. If I walk away in this round, my value is 1227 * .9 = 1104.3.\n\nTo improve on that, let's calculate the items I want to keep to have a value of 1130. Since Item 3 is worth the most, I want to always keep all of them.\n\nLet's give the following [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    *   Item 1: I keep 6 - 1 = 5 units\n    *   Item 2: I keep 7 - 0 = 7 units\n    *   Item 3: I keep 6 - 0 = 6 units\n    *   Item 4: I keep 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 5: I keep 4 - 0 = 4 units\n\nValue of this potential counteroffer to me: (5 * 61) + (7 * 66) + (6 * 100) + (1 * 9) + (4 * 16) = 305 + 462 + 600 + 9 + 64 = 1440\n\nThe value to me is 1440, discounted to round 3 is 1440 * .9 * .9 = 1166.4\nThis offer is better than my outside offer * the discount rate * 0.9, and I should accept my offer\n\nGiven the above analysis, it is still best to accept the current offer\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

To avoid making mistake 2, I must ensure that what I keep is worth more than 16.\n    To have some chance of being accepted, I need to offer Player 2 some items of high value.\n    Let me try offering [0, 1, 1, 4, 0]. This means I keep [2, 3, 3, 5, 1], which has a value of\n    * 2 * 74 + 3 * 62 + 3 * 94 + 5 * 11 + 1 * 36 = 148 + 186 + 282 + 55 + 36 = 707\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nI will propose a counteroffer that gives Player 2 [0, 1, 1, 4, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 4, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 508. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 396 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 7, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 23 x 4 + 2 x 3 + 53 x 7 + 38 x 1\n    which is 507 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 508. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 2, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 2 + 12 x 2 + 69 x 2 + 55 x 2 + 47 x 6\n    which is 730 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 731. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine my best course of action in this negotiation.\n\n**1) Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 731\n*   **Values of the items:** Item 1 = 88, Item 2 = 12, Item 3 = 69, Item 4 = 55, Item 5 = 47\n*   **Total pool of items:** 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of its value in round 1, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 81% of its value in round 1.\n\n**2) Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider what I would offer to Player 2 to maximize my value while ensuring it's greater than my outside offer. I want to leave room for negotiation, but also make a reasonable offer that Player 2 might accept.\n\n**3) Initial Counteroffer Strategy:**\n\nSince there's no offer on the table, I need to make the first move. My goal is to propose an offer that gives Player 2 enough value to be interested in negotiating, while still securing a value for myself that exceeds my outside offer of 731. I want to avoid offering too much, but I also don't want to be so stingy that Player 2 immediately walks away.\n\nLet's start by trying to find a division of items where I retain a value slightly above my outside offer. I'll aim for a value of around 800-850 for myself initially, leaving some room to concede later if needed.\n\nLet's try offering player 2: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\nMy value would be:\n(1 * 88) + (1 * 12) + (3 * 69) + (1 * 55) + (3 * 47) = 88 + 12 + 207 + 55 + 141 = 503.\nThis is much less than my outside offer of 731, so this won't work.\n\nLet's try offering player 2 less. Lets offer player 2: 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 1 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with: 2 unit of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, 4 units of item 5.\nMy value would be:\n(2 * 88) + (2 * 12) + (4 * 69) + (2 * 55) + (4 * 47) = 176 + 24 + 276 + 110 + 188 = 774.\nThis is better than my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering player 2 even less. Lets offer player 2: 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 1 units of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with: 2 unit of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\nMy value would be:\n(2 * 88) + (2 * 12) + (5 * 69) + (2 * 55) + (5 * 47) = 176 + 24 + 345 + 110 + 235 = 890.\n\nLet's try offering player 2 less. Lets offer player 2: 0 unit of item 1, 0 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, 0 units of item 5\n\nThis would leave me with: 2 unit of item 1, 2 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 unit of item 4, 6 units of item 5.\nMy value would be:\n(2 * 88) + (2 * 12) + (5 * 69) + (2 * 55) + (6 * 47) = 176 + 24 + 345 + 110 + 282 = 937.\n\nI will choose the offer that gives me a value of 774, since I need to leave room for negotiation.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 166. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 930 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 5, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 1 + 99 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 27 x 5 + 91 x 0\n    which is 164 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 166. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

A simple viable scenario is [1, 1, 2, 2, 1] offered to Player 1:\n     - I will receive:\n       - Item 1: 3 units = 3 * 95 = 285\n       - Item 2: 4 units = 4 * 99 = 396\n       - Item 3: 2 units = 2 * 64 = 128\n       - Item 4: 3 units = 3 * 82 = 246\n       - Item 5: 4 units = 4 * 49 = 196\n     - Total value = 285 + 396 + 128 + 246 + 196 = 1251\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\n   - The current offer from Player 1 gives me a total value of 778, which is less than my outside offer of 1250.\n   - A counteroffer with [1, 1, 2, 2, 1] to Player 1 is worth 1251 to me, which is slightly more than my outside offer.\n   - Thus, this counteroffer is better for me than both the current offer and my outside offer, making it a reasonable choice.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, I will propose a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 361. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 361. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 768 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    16 x 0 + 53 x 0 + 59 x 3 + 73 x 1 + 55 x 2\n    which is 360 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 361. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **Outside offer value:** 361\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 16, Item 2: 53, Item 3: 59, Item 4: 73, Item 5: 55\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 4, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 4, Item 4: 5, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. Since it is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am being offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 1] units of items 1 through 5, respectively.\n\n    *   My value if I accept the current offer:\n        *   Item 1: 1 * 16 = 16\n        *   Item 2: 1 * 53 = 53\n        *   Item 3: 2 * 59 = 118\n        *   Item 4: 2 * 73 = 146\n        *   Item 5: 1 * 55 = 55\n        *   Total value = 16 + 53 + 118 + 146 + 55 = 388\n\n    *   Discounted value of accepting the current offer = 388 * 0.9 = 349.2\n\n*   **Value of keeping all the items:** (4 * 16) + (5 * 53) + (4 * 59) + (5 * 73) + (5 * 55) = 64 + 265 + 236 + 365 + 275 = 1205\n*   **Consider the previous offer:** Player 1 originally offered [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] to Player 2. That means I was getting [2, 3, 2, 3, 3] units of each item. The value of that is (2*16) + (3*53) + (2*59) + (3*73) + (3*55) = 32 + 159 + 118 + 219 + 165 = 693. Discounted value = 693 * 0.9 = 623.7. It's important to remember that if the previous offer was worse than what I have now I should be wary of making offers that are worse than what I offered before.\n*   **Comparison:** The value of accepting the current offer (349.2) is less than my outside offer (361). However the offer I have is more than my outside offer if it wasn't discounted.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current discounted offer value is less than my outside offer value. The previous offer that I offered was more valuable to me.\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside option after the discount is applied, I should not accept it. I'll try making a counteroffer that is better for me than the current one, but also tries to give something to player 2, instead of walking away.\n\nI'll try to take back one unit from item 3 and one unit from item 4 and offer this to the other player. That offer would be [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]. If I keep 3 units of item 3, and 3 units of item 4, my total value would be 16 + 53 + (2 * 59) + (2 * 73) + 55 = 16 + 53 + 177 + 219 + 55 = 520. 520 * 0.9 = 468, which is good.\n\nSo, my counteroffer is to offer [1, 1, 3, 3, 1] to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 3, 1]}\n```",

An optimal offer will balance along increasing item 2's units.\n\nTo propose a more favorable allocation:\n\nFor [4, 3, 1, 2, 3] (offering [0, 2, 3, 3, 2] to Player 1):\n\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 95 = 380\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- Total value = 380 + 297 + 64 + 164 + 147 = 1052\n\nAfter observing the discounted value and previous attempts, I must adjust yet again to provide a viable option to secure above 1250, taking into account realistic item distribution and acceptance.\n\nUltimately, [4, 4, 2, 1, 3] (offering [0, 1, 2, 4, 2] to Player 1):\n\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 95 = 380\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 99 = 396\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n- 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- Total value = 380 + 396 + 128 + 82 + 147 = 1133\n\nThis remains undervalued still considering the challenge to reach 1250 needed post reduction.\n\nThus, after strategic evaluation to surpass such a hurdle:\nMore elaborately calculate variations as duplicates yield alternate scenarios:\n\nUltimately, retain a 3 Unit bias across items best represents productive countering alongside steady progress on unit doubling.\nFlexibly weighed calculation with adjustments double-type 1 and 5, presciently forwarding optimal exposure.\n\nHence, the path electing wholly centers towards narrowing weighted contrast intently within resolution:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 2 + 74 x 1 + 45 x 0 + 27 x 1 + 60 x 0\n    which is 139 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 142. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 7, 0, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    8 x 2 + 6 x 7 + 23 x 0 + 21 x 2 + 2 x 5\n    which is 110 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 111. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide my action, let's analyze the current situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 111.\n   - **Values of Items:**\n     - Item 1: 8\n     - Item 2: 6\n     - Item 3: 23\n     - Item 4: 21\n     - Item 5: 2\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** [3 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5]\n   - The discount factor doesn't apply immediately in the first round as it affects future rounds. However, it would influence subsequent decisions if the negotiation continues.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer Given by Player 1:** [1, 4, 0, 1, 3]\n\n     Let's calculate the value of this offer for me:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n     - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n     - 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 23 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 21 = 21\n     - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n     - Total value = 8 + 24 + 0 + 21 + 6 = 59\n\n   - **Comparison with Outside Offer:** The value of 59 from Player 1's offer is significantly lower than my outside offer of 111.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - **Accepting the Current Offer:** Would give me a value of 59, which is less than my outside offer of 111.\n   - **Walking Away:** Would give me an assured value of 111, which is higher than the current offer.\n   - **Proposing a Counteroffer:** I should make a counteroffer that results in a value for me higher than 111.\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer that maximizes my value while still attempting to keep the negotiation open. I need to keep as many high-valued items as possible.\n\n   A potential counteroffer could be:\n   - [0, 3, 0, 0, 2] (I keep 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 3 of item 5)\n\n   Calculate my value if I keep [3, 4, 1, 2, 3]:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n   - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n   - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n   - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n   - Total value = 24 + 24 + 23 + 42 + 6 = 119\n\n   This counteroffer gives me a value of 119, which is more than my outside offer of 111. Thus, this is an acceptable counteroffer according to my goals.\n\nGiven these calculations, my action will be to propose this counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 1 + 36 x 0 + 81 x 0 + 19 x 1 + 10 x 1\n    which is 50 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 53. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's analyze the current situation step-by-step.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 987.\n\n- **Values of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 17 per unit\n  - Item 2: 89 per unit\n  - Item 3: 71 per unit\n  - Item 4: 64 per unit\n  - Item 5: 75 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 4 units\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 6 units\n  - Item 5: 3 units\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor of 0.9 will reduce the value of the deal the longer it takes to reach. Since we are in round 2, the value of an accepted offer would be multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{r-1} = 0.9^1 = 0.9 \\).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer:** [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  - Value if accepted:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n  - Total value = 17\n  - Discounted to present value = 17 \u00d7 0.9 = 15.3 (which is significantly less than my outside offer of 987)\n\n- **Previous Offers (for context):**\n  - Player 1's offer in round 1: [0, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n  - My counter offer in round 1: [3, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** Find a distribution where the value to me exceeds 987. For example, consider keeping more high-value items while proposing fewer or not as significantly lower-value offers to Player 1.\n\n  A prospective counteroffer:\n  - Keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5 (offer: [2, 3, 1, 3, 2])\n  - Calculate the total value if kept:\n    - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 17 = 17\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 71 = 142\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 75 = 75\n  - Total value = 17 + 89 + 142 + 192 + 75 = 515 (multiplied by 0.9 = 463.5)\n\nGiven this counteroffer doesn't exceed the outside offer, further rebalancing is necessary. We'll need to offer less of items with higher values.\n\n- **Another Counteroffer:** [1, 0, 0, 5, 1] (meaning I keep 2 units of item 1, all 4 units of item 2, all 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5.)\n  - Calculate:\n    - 2 \u00d7 17 + 4 \u00d7 89 + 3 \u00d7 71 + 1 \u00d7 64 + 2 \u00d7 75 = 34 + 356 + 213 + 64 + 150 = 817\n  - Discount: 817 x 0.9 = 735.3 (still less than 987)\n\nTo give a higher value counteroffer:\n- **Final Counteroffer:** [1, 1, 2, 5, 3] - valuable high-value components like item 2 and item 3 more.\n  - Calculate if I keep:\n    - 2 \u00d7 17 (Item 1) + 3 \u00d7 89 (Item 2) + 1 \u00d7 71 (Item 3) + 1 \u00d7 64 (Item 4) + 0 \u00d7 75 (Item 5)\n  - This total = 34 + 267 + 71 + 64 + 0 = 436 \u2013 below the 987 outside offer\n       \nContinuing further efforts would result in similar lowered values due to inherent distribution choices. Surely an improved offer should validly exceed this by minimizing less valuable options.\n\nGiven our runtime calculations, considering no options exceed 987 swiftly without recalibrated effort significantly:\n  \n### 3) Decision\n\nSince no offer exceeds the outside value of 987 for value preservation strategically, and no significantly higher-reaching proposals appear:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 5. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 549 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 566. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 609 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 3, 3, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    59 x 0 + 21 x 1 + 85 x 3 + 3 x 3 + 35 x 8\n    which is 565 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 566. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the best course of action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 566\n*   **My item values:** Item 1: 59, Item 2: 21, Item 3: 85, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 35\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 3, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 3, Item 4: 4, Item 5: 9\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that offers in later rounds are worth less. An offer worth X in round 2 is worth 0.9X now, and an offer worth X in round 3 is worth 0.81X now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** There is no current offer.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** Since I'm Player 1 and it's round 1, I need to make an initial offer to Player 2. I need to figure out an offer that Player 2 might accept, while still giving me a value greater than my outside offer.\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** Any offer I accept must be worth more than 566 to me.\n\n3) **Develop a strategy and initial offer:**\n\nI need to propose a division of items that gives me a value greater than 566 and is also attractive enough for Player 2 to consider.\nLet's try to create an offer where I keep approximately half the value and give the other half to player 2. My total value of all items is (3 * 59) + (5 * 21) + (3 * 85) + (4 * 3) + (9 * 35) = 177 + 105 + 255 + 12 + 315 = 864. Half of this is approximately 432.\n\nTherefore, I need to calculate what I would keep in order to receive a value greater than 566.\n\nI will start by offering the following:\nItem 1: 1\nItem 2: 2\nItem 3: 1\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 4\n\nThis means I keep:\nItem 1: 2\nItem 2: 3\nItem 3: 2\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 5\n\nMy value is: (2 * 59) + (3 * 21) + (2 * 85) + (2 * 3) + (5 * 35) = 118 + 63 + 170 + 6 + 175 = 532. This is not good enough.\n\nLet's try another split.\nI offer:\nItem 1: 0\nItem 2: 0\nItem 3: 0\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 2\n\nI keep:\nItem 1: 3\nItem 2: 5\nItem 3: 3\nItem 4: 2\nItem 5: 7\n\nMy value is: (3 * 59) + (5 * 21) + (3 * 85) + (2 * 3) + (7 * 35) = 177 + 105 + 255 + 6 + 245 = 788\n\nThis is above 566.\nLet's create this offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]}\n```",

This means Player 1 would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 3\n    *   Item 2: 5\n    *   Item 3: 3\n    *   Item 4: 2\n    *   Item 5: 7\n        Total value: (3 * 59) + (5 * 21) + (3 * 85) + (2 * 3) + (7 * 35) = 177 + 105 + 255 + 6 + 245 = 788\n    * Discounted value if accepted in round 2: 788 * 0.9 = 709.2\n\n*   **Outside Offer:** 566\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer, if accepted, yields a discounted value of 671.4.\n*   My outside offer is 566.\n*   The original offer I made in round 1 would have yielded 709.2 (if Player 2 had accepted).\n\nSince the current offer is better than my outside offer (671.4 > 566), I should not walk away. The Round 1 offer I made would have yielded me more than the current offer I received, but Player 2 rejected it.\nThe current offer is better than my outside offer, so accepting is a good choice.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 690. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 981 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 0 + 50 x 0 + 29 x 1 + 91 x 6 + 57 x 2\n    which is 689 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 690. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value. Since I am going first, I want to reach a deal as early as possible, and delaying reduces value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer.\n   - I need to come up with a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer.\n   - I will start by calculating the total value of all items if I kept everything: (4 * 100) + (2 * 50) + (6 * 29) + (6 * 91) + (4 * 57) = 400 + 100 + 174 + 546 + 228 = 1448.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since I am Player 1 and it is round 1, I need to make an initial offer. I need to leave myself with items whose values are at least my outside offer of 690.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 half of everything. This would mean giving Player 2: 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5. Then I would keep 2, 1, 3, 3, and 2 respectively.\nMy value would be:\n(2 * 100) + (1 * 50) + (3 * 29) + (3 * 91) + (2 * 57) = 200 + 50 + 87 + 273 + 114 = 724.\nThis is greater than my outside offer.\n\nNow let's try a more aggressive offer for myself. What if I offer [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]? Then, I will have [3, 2, 4, 4, 3]. This gives me:\n(3 * 100) + (2 * 50) + (4 * 29) + (4 * 91) + (3 * 57) = 300 + 100 + 116 + 364 + 171 = 1051. This is a good deal!\n\nOkay, I'll start with an offer that gives me a good amount, but also leaves the other player with potentially something they would want to accept. I'll go with offering [1, 0, 2, 2, 1] to Player 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 2, 1]}\n```",
