Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 754. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 754. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 750 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 6, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 0 + 91 x 4 + 61 x 6 + 6 x 1 + 17 x 1\n    which is 753 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 754. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To address the current negotiation situation, I'll begin by analyzing and answering the step-by-step questions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **What is my outside offer value?**\n   - My outside offer value is 754.\n\n2. **What are the values of the items involved?**\n   - Item 1: 75 per unit\n   - Item 2: 91 per unit\n   - Item 3: 61 per unit\n   - Item 4: 6 per unit\n   - Item 5: 17 per unit\n\n3. **What is the total pool of items?**\n   - Item 1: 9 units\n   - Item 2: 4 units\n   - Item 3: 6 units\n   - Item 4: 4 units\n   - Item 5: 1 unit\n\n4. **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**\n   - The negotiation value decreases by the factor of gamma (0.9) per each additional round (for future offers). However, there is no current offer to analyze.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n   - There is no current offer presented.\n\n2. **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that ensures my value from the items retained is greater than my outside offer value of 754.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\nSince I'm making the first move (initial counteroffer), I need to propose divisions that yield a total value greater than 754. Here\u2019s an analysis for a potential offer:\n\n**Potential Counteroffer:** Keep [6, 0, 0, 4, 0] and offer [3, 4, 6, 0, 1] to Player 2.\n\n- Value of items kept:\n  - Item 1: 6 units x 75 = 450\n  - Item 2: 0 units x 91 = 0\n  - Item 3: 0 units x 61 = 0\n  - Item 4: 4 units x 6 = 24\n  - Item 5: 0 units x 17 = 0\n- Total Value = 450 + 0 + 0 + 24 + 0 = 474\n\nSince the total value from this offer (474) is less than my outside offer (754), this proposed division is not advantageous. Let's try another combination:\n\n**Adjusted Counteroffer:** Keep [7, 1, 1, 4, 1] and offer [2, 3, 5, 0, 0] to Player 2.\n\n- Value of items kept:\n  - Item 1: 7 units x 75 = 525\n  - Item 2: 1 unit x 91 = 91\n  - Item 3: 1 unit x 61 = 61\n  - Item 4: 4 units x 6 = 24\n  - Item 5: 1 unit x 17 = 17\n- Total Value = 525 + 91 + 61 + 24 + 17 = 718\n\nSince the total value from this offer (718) is still less than my outside offer (754), this proposed division is also not advantageous. Continuing adjustments:\n\n**Final Counteroffer:** Keep [8, 2, 1, 4, 1] and offer [1, 2, 5, 0, 0] to Player 2.\n\n- Value of items kept:\n  - Item 1: 8 units x 75 = 600\n  - Item 2: 2 units x 91 = 182\n  - Item 3: 1 unit x 61 = 61\n  - Item 4: 4 units x 6 = 24\n  - Item 5: 1 unit x 17 = 17\n- Total Value = 600 + 182 + 61 + 24 + 17 = 884\n\nThe above offer yields a total value (884) greater than my outside offer (754), making it an advantageous proposal.\n\nGiven the analysis and calculations, I will proceed with the following action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 5, 0, 0]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 6, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 0 + 91 x 4 + 61 x 6 + 6 x 1 + 17 x 1\n    which is 753 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 754. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 5, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Here's a potential offer:\n\n- **Proposal to Keep:** \n  - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n  - **Total Value:** 356 + 291 + 174 + 252 + 0 = 1073\n\n- **Offer to Player 2:** 0 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n\nThis allocation ensures my total exceeds my outside offer value of 78.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on Analysis:\nI will propose the offer described because:\n- The value to me (1073) is significantly higher than my outside offer (78).\n- There is no current offer to accept.\n- Walking away now would mean settling for the outside offer, which is less beneficial.\n\nTherefore, my action will be to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 2, 1, 3]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

Your value would be:\n    82 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 18 x 0 + 38 x 1 + 67 x 2\n    which is 172 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 174. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine my best action in this negotiation, I'll follow the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) First, analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 983.\n   - The values of the items are:\n     - Item 1: 93\n     - Item 2: 60\n     - Item 3: 76\n     - Item 4: 19\n     - Item 5: 47\n   - The total pool of items consists of:\n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 2 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 6 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor gamma = 0.9 influences the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers. This means the value of any accepted offer will be adjusted by this factor starting from round 2 onwards.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Since there is currently no offer on the table, I cannot accept or evaluate any current offer.\n   - I need to consider potential counteroffers to ensure their value exceeds my outside offer value of 983.\n     - For a potential counteroffer where I keep most of the high-value items, let's calculate an initial proposal:\n\n       Proposal: I keep 3 units of item 1, all 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, none of item 4, and 4 units of item 5. Offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n       Value calculation if I keep:\n       - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n       - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n       - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n       - Item 5: 4 \u00d7 47 = 188\n       Total value = 279 + 240 + 152 + 0 + 188 = 859\n\n   - The value I've gained from this counteroffer is 859, which is less than my outside offer of 983. Therefore, this initial proposal is not viable as it does not meet my minimum threshold.\n\n3) Make a decision based on analysis:\n   - Given that an offer where I keep a significant number of high-value items does not surpass my outside offer value, I must revise my strategy to increase my value from the current negotiation.\n\n     Let's adjust the counteroffer to focus more on high-value items:\n     - I keep all 4 units of item 1, all 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, none of item 4, and 5 units of item 5. Offer the rest to Player 2.\n\n     Value calculation if I keep:\n     - Item 1: 4 \u00d7 93 = 372\n     - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n     - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n     - Item 4: 0 \u00d7 19 = 0\n     - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n     Total value = 372 + 240 + 152 + 0 + 235 = 999\n\n     - This proposal has a total value of 999, which is greater than my outside offer value of 983. Thus, it is acceptable.\n\nThe strategy is to make an acceptable counteroffer that maximizes the value received based on my preferences and surpasses the fallback option of my outside offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 5, 1]}\n``` \n\nThis reflects that I propose to keep 4 units of item 1, 4 of item 2, 2 of item 3, no units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action, let's proceed step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Your Outside Offer Value:**\n   - Your outside offer value is 983.\n\n2. **Values of the Items:**\n   - Item 1: 4 units, valued at 93 each.\n   - Item 2: 4 units, valued at 60 each.\n   - Item 3: 2 units, valued at 76 each.\n   - Item 4: 5 units, valued at 19 each.\n   - Item 5: 6 units, valued at 47 each.\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - Item 1: 4 units\n   - Item 2: 4 units\n   - Item 3: 2 units\n   - Item 4: 5 units\n   - Item 5: 6 units\n\n4. **Discount Factor:**\n   - The discount rate is gamma = 0.9. Since it is round 2, this means any offer should be valued at its full calculated value, as gamma to the power (r-1) in this case is \\(0.9^1 = 0.9\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer (If Accepted):**\n   - Current offer to you: [2, 2, 1, 4, 1]\n   - Your value if accepted:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 60 = 120\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n     - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 19 = 76\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 47 = 47\n     - Total value = 186 + 120 + 76 + 76 + 47 = 505\n   - Adjusting for the discount factor (current round value):\n     - Adjusted value = 505 \u00d7 0.9 = 454.5\n\n2. **Comparing to Outside Offer:**\n   - 454.5 (current adjusted offer value) is significantly lower than your outside offer value of 983.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven this analysis, the current offer from Player 2 (adjusted for the discount factor) is much less beneficial than simply taking your outside offer. Therefore, accepting the current offer is not viable. Walking away could be considered if there is no better counteroffer.\n\n### Counteroffer Evaluation\n\nLet's find a potential counteroffer:\n\n- Try keeping, for example, a more advantageous combination while still above the outside offer value:\n  Let's test another division: where you keep [3, 2, 1, 5, 5] and offer [1, 2, 1, 0, 1] to Player 2.\n\n- Value of keeping [3, 2, 1, 5, 5]:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n  - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 60 = 120\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 76 = 76\n  - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 19 = 95\n  - Item 5: 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n  - Total value = 279 + 120 + 76 + 95 + 235 = 805\n\n805 (even without the discount adjustment) is still less than 983. Let's iterate again, this time experimenting by:\nProposing: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] items to Player 2, meaning you keep [3, 4, 2, 4, 6], thus:\n\n- Value calculation:\n    - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n    - Item 2: 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n    - Item 4: 4 \u00d7 19 = 76\n    - Item 5: 6 \u00d7 47 = 282\n    - Total = 279 + 240 + 152 + 76 + 282 = 1029\n\nAdjusted for the discount factor (0.9 since it's round 2):\n   - 1029 \u00d7 0.9 = 926.1 still less than the outside offer.\n\nSince it's hard to reach an alternative where the combined reduction provides a higher value adjusted for discount factor than the outside offer, and being mindful of negotiation behaviors (Mistakes), if the options available aren't sufficient alternatives this might determine a chosen strategy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on all the assessments, your action should be to WALK, as you've not tailored to better than what you've secured with an outside offer. The negotiations don't yield as beneficial as the outside offer based on the current exploration routes.\n\nGiven such factors:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 368. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 368. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 345 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 7, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 3 + 34 x 0 + 29 x 7 + 5 x 2 + 4 x 6\n    which is 366 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 368. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 0, 7, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 3 + 34 x 0 + 29 x 7 + 5 x 2 + 4 x 6\n    which is 366 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 368. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To decide the best action, let's analyze the current situation using the step-by-step questions provided.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **What is my outside offer value?**\n   - Your outside offer value is 368.\n\n2. **What are the values of the items involved?**\n   - Item 1: Value per unit = 43\n   - Item 2: Value per unit = 34\n   - Item 3: Value per unit = 29\n   - Item 4: Value per unit = 5\n   - Item 5: Value per unit = 4\n\n3. **What is the total pool of items?**\n   - Item 1: 3 units\n   - Item 2: 0 units\n   - Item 3: 8 units\n   - Item 4: 2 units\n   - Item 5: 6 units\n\n4. **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. \n   - Since it is round 2, the discount factor for this round would be \\(0.9^{(2-1)} = 0.9\\). \n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n   - Current offer [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] means I keep [3, 0, 7, 2, 6].\n   - My value if I accept this offer:\n     - Value from Item 1: \\(3 \\times 43 = 129\\)\n     - Value from Item 3: \\(7 \\times 29 = 203\\)\n     - Value from Item 4: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n     - Value from Item 5: \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\)\n     - Total value = \\(129 + 203 + 10 + 24 = 366\\)\n   - Adjusted for discount: \\(366 \\times 0.9 = 329.4\\)\n\n2. **How do these values compare to my outside offer value?**\n   - The adjusted total value of accepting the current offer (329.4) is less than my outside offer value (368).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**\n  - No, because the value (329.4) is less than my outside offer (368).\n\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  - Not immediately, since I have an opportunity to propose a counteroffer.\n\n- **Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n  - Yes, let's propose a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer value.\n\n### Crafting a Counteroffer\n\nI need to propose a counteroffer where my value exceeds my outside offer. One possible way to approach this:\n\nLet's propose:\n- I keep 3 units of item 1, 8 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 2 units of item 5, offering the remaining to Player 2.\n\nCalculating my value for this proposed offer:\n- Item 1: 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- Item 3: 8 units, value = 8 \u00d7 29 = 232\n- Item 4: 1 unit, value = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Item 5: 2 units, value = 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nTotal = 129 + 232 + 5 + 8 = 374\n\nDiscounted: 374 \u00d7 0.9 = 336.6 (less than outside offer)\n\nLet's try a yet another counteroffer:\n- I will offer Player 2 all units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5 and see if I meet or exceed 368.\nNow I will offer Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 2, 3]\n- Calculating my value for this proposed offer:\n- Item 1: 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- Item 3: 8 units, value = 8 \u00d7 29 = 232\n- Item 5: 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nTotal value = 129 + 232 + 12 = 373\n\nDiscounted: 373 \u00d7 0.9 = 335.7 (still less than outside offer)\n\nNow let's propose a bit more aggressive counteroffer:\n- I will offer Player 2 all units of item 4 and 1 units of item 5:[0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\n\n- Calculating my value for this proposed offer:\n- Item 1: 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- Item 3: 8 units, value = 8 \u00d7 29 = 232\n- Item 5: 5 units, value = 5 \u00d7 4 = 20\n\nTotal value = 129 + 232 + 20 = 381 \n\nDiscounted: 381 \u00d7 0.9 = 342.9 (less than outside offer)\n\nLet's reduce item 5 by 1:\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n- Calculating my value for this proposed offer:\n- Item 1: 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- Item 3: 8 units, value = 8 \u00d7 29 = 232\n- Item 5: 6 units, value = 6 \u00d7 4 = 24\n\nTotal value = 129 + 232 + 24 = 385\n\nDiscounted: 385 \u00d7 0.9 = 346.5 (less than outside offer)\n\nOr suggest: [0, 0, 1, 0, 6]\nMy value will be:\n- Item 1: 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- Item 3: 7 units, value = 7 \u00d7 29 = 203\n\nTotal = 129 + 203 = 332\n\nDiscounted: 332 \u00d7 0.9 = 298.8 (less than outside offer)\n\nLet's try something different:\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 1, 5]\n- Calculating my value for this proposed offer:\n- Item 1: 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- Item 3: 8 units, value = 8 \u00d7 29 = 232\n- Item 4: 1 unit, value = 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- Item 5: 1 unit, value = 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n\nTotal = 129 + 232 + 5 + 4 = 370 \n\nDiscounted: 370 \u00d7 0.9 = 333 (less than outside offer)\n\nLet's make another try.\n- Offer Player 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n- Calculating my value for this proposed offer:\n- Item 1: 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- Item 3: 8 units, value = 8 \u00d7 29 = 232\n- Item 4: 2 unit, value = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- Item 5: 4 unit, value = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n\nTotal = 129 + 232 + 10 + 16 = 387 \n\nDiscounted: 387 \u00d7 0.9 = 348.3 (less than outside offer)\n  \nAfter multiple attempts without success, I will walk.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"} \n",

Since it is round 1, the discount factor does not apply yet (i.e., \\( \\gamma^0 = 1 \\)).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to accept. I need to create an initial offer.\n   - I need to ensure my offer retains a value for me higher than my outside offer value (668).\n\nLet me calculate the possible values for different divisions. We start by determining how much value each division would provide me, ensuring to uphold some amount of fairness to lead to a potential acceptance by Player 2.\n\nA candidate offer could be to maximize high-value items and try different divisions to be better than the outside offer:\n\nFor example, let's keep as many high-value items as possible and valuate:\n\n- Suppose I keep 6 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5, i.e., [0, 6, 0, 0, 1] for Player 2:\n\n  - My value would be:\n    - 6 units of item 1: 6 x 32 = 192\n    - 1 unit of item 2: 1 x 53 = 53\n    - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 98 = 196\n    - 6 units of item 4: 6 x 17 = 102\n    - 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 15 = 15\n  - Total value to me: 192 + 53 + 196 + 102 + 15 = 558\n\nThis configuration is lower than the outside offer value of 668, hence a negotiation leveraging more balance with Player 2's likely perceived fairness:\n\nLet's adjust to [1, 5, 0, 1, 1] for Player 2:\n- Calculating my values:\n  - 5 units of item 1: 5 x 32 = 160\n  - 2 units of item 2: 2 x 53 = 106\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 98 = 196\n  - 5 units of item 4: 5 x 17 = 85\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 15 = 15\n- Total value: 160 + 106 + 196 + 85 + 15 = 562\n\nThis still doesn\u2019t exceed my outside offer, so it remains unwise. We must continue adjusting:\n\nOne more attempt: [1, 4, 0, 1, 1] for Player 2:\n- Calculating:\n  - 5 units of item 1: 5 x 32 = 160\n  - 3 units of item 2: 3 x 53 = 159\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 98 = 196\n  - 5 units of item 4: 5 x 17 = 85\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 x 15 = 15\n- Total value: 160 + 159 + 196 + 85 + 15 = 615\n\nThis value is still less than 668.\n\nTo propose a worthy counteroffer despite the struggle to better my assured offer significantly:\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nUntil a better scenario arrives, an initial calculated encounter must stay at non-minimal utility for round 1, compelling concessions based on probable forecast by player 2's values in actual game settings.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 7, 1, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 1 + 48 x 7 + 26 x 1 + 32 x 4 + 13 x 2\n    which is 540 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 541. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 4, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 4, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Thus, I have to make an initial offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**  \n  To maximize my value, I need to calculate potential distributions of items and ensure that their total value is at least 650, the value of my outside offer. \n\nLet's consider a potential offer where I give:\n  - 1 unit of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 0 units of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 0 units of item 5\n\n**My Holdings:**\n- Items kept for myself:\n  - 5 - 1 = 4 units of Item 1\n  - 4 - 1 = 3 units of Item 2\n  - 3 - 0 = 3 units of Item 3\n  - 5 - 1 = 4 units of Item 4\n  - 4 - 0 = 4 units of Item 5\n\n**My Value Calculation:**\n- Value from Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 22 = 88\n- Value from Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 8 = 24\n- Value from Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 91 = 273\n- Value from Item 4: 4 units \u00d7 9 = 36\n- Value from Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 61 = 244\n\n**Total Value of Keeping:** 665\n\n665 is greater than my outside offer of 650, hence this proposed division satisfies the condition of securing an offer better than walking away.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\nGiven the calculations:\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer:** Not possible as no offer is presented.\n- **Walk Away:** Not ideal since I calculated a potential offer where my value exceeds my outside offer.\n- **Propose a Specific Counteroffer:** I should make the calculated offer that gives me a better value than my outside offer.\n\n### My Decision:\n\nI'm providing the following initial counteroffer, allowing me to keep 4, 3, 3, 4, 4 units of the items respectively, which gives me a total value of 665:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 930. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 882 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 3, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 4 + 31 x 1 + 85 x 3 + 51 x 4 + 69 x 3\n    which is 929 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 930. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 0 + 35 x 1 + 22 x 1 + 41 x 6 + 51 x 2\n    which is 405 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 406. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

My primary goal is to ensure that whatever offer I propose results in a total value greater than my outside offer (406).\n\n3) Calculate potential counteroffers that result in a value greater than 406:\n   - One possible approach is to keep a higher percentage of high-value items while experimenting with combinations of other items to maximize the value of what I keep.\n\n   - Proposal: Offer [1, 0, 0, 1, 3] to Player 2 (meaning I keep the rest):\n\n     - I keep:\n       - 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 20 = 100\n       - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 35 = 140\n       - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n       - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 41 = 205\n       - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n\n     - Total value if I keep these: 100 + 140 + 44 + 205 + 51 = 540\n\n   - This value (540) is greater than my outside offer (406), so it fulfills the strategic condition to prevent making offer mistakes noted.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will propose a counteroffer to Player 2. \n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 1, 3]}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 0 + 47 x 1 + 56 x 0 + 96 x 0 + 55 x 0\n    which is 47 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 55. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My strategy will be to propose a counteroffer that provides a value significantly above my outside offer and adjust as necessary if they counter later.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will propose the following initial offer to Player 2:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 7, 0, 2]}\n```\n\nThis offer gives Player 2 all units of items 2, 3, and 5 while I keep the high-value items 1 and 4, ensuring my retained items' value exceeds my outside fallback option.",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 7, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 0 + 73 x 0 + 44 x 7 + 90 x 2 + 33 x 3\n    which is 587 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 588. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 3, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 6, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 6, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Since no offer is on the table, let's propose a reasonable offer.\n\n  Start by considering offering some units which would still keep my value above my outside offer reliably.\n\n  Suppose I propose to keep [1, 2, 3, 5, 2] and give [0, 1, 3, 2, 1] to Player 2.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 252. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 834 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 6, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    51 x 0 + 51 x 0 + 93 x 1 + 15 x 6 + 68 x 1\n    which is 251 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 252. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 4 + 64 x 0 + 67 x 3 + 50 x 2 + 99 x 3\n    which is 894 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 899. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 83 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 29 x 1\n    which is 29 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 31. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make the best decision, let's evaluate the situation step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 31.\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 86\n  - Item 2: 6\n  - Item 3: 83\n  - Item 4: 65\n  - Item 5: 29\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 3 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 4 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 6 units of item 5\n- **Discount Factor Gamma**: The value of any outcome will be reduced by a factor of \\( \\gamma^{r-1} \\), where \\( r \\) is the round number. Since it's round 1, the discount factor doesn't apply yet.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there's no current offer on the table, I'll consider potential first offers.\n\nTo create a counteroffer, I need to ensure it is worth more than the outside offer. Therefore, we seek an arrangement where my value exceeds 31.\n\n- **Example Counteroffer Outcome**:\n  - Keep 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - Keep 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n  - Keep 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 83 = 249\n  - Keep 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n  - Keep 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n  - Total Value = 172 + 0 + 249 + 65 + 87 = 573\n\nBy playing with the numbers, we ensure the offer is beneficial without giving too much to Player 2 or making an extreme proposal (Mistakes 3 and 4).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nNow, I'll propose a first offer that allows me to maximize my payoff and avoid the identified negotiation mistakes. Let's offer Player 2:\n\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis means I'm keeping 2 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5, resulting in a value of 573 for me, which is more significant than my outside offer of 31.\n\nProviding this offer adheres to the strategy rules, ensuring no mistake is made as per the guidelines.\n\nMy action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 0 + 6 x 0 + 83 x 0 + 65 x 0 + 29 x 1\n    which is 29 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 31. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 3, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's walk through the analysis step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: Your outside offer value is 31.\n\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 86 per unit\n  - Item 2: 6 per unit\n  - Item 3: 83 per unit\n  - Item 4: 65 per unit\n  - Item 5: 29 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 3 units\n  - Item 2: 1 unit\n  - Item 3: 4 units\n  - Item 4: 3 units\n  - Item 5: 6 units\n\n- **Discount Factor**: In round 2, the discount factor doesn't affect the value yet since it's still early. If we reach round 3, values are discounted by a factor of 0.9.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer on the Table (Offered to You)**: [1, 0, 3, 1, 2]\n  - Your value from this offer:\n    - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 86 = 86\n    - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n    - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 83 = 249\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n    - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n  - Total Value = 86 + 0 + 249 + 65 + 58 = 458\n\n- **Compare to Outside Offer**: \n  - Current offer value to you (458) is greater than your outside offer (31).\n\n- **Previous Offer You Made ([1, 1, 1, 2, 3])**:\n  - Your value from this offer (what you'd keep):\n    - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n    - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 6 = 0\n    - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 83 = 249\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 65 = 65\n    - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 29 = 87\n  - Total Value = 573\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?**\n  - The current offer's value (458) is much higher than your outside offer (31) but lower than your previous offer's personal value (573). However, the current offer is significantly profitable compared to the outside offer.\n\n- **Should I Walk Away?**\n  - Given the current negotiations, walking away is not an optimal choice since the current offer is better than the outside offer.\n\n- **Should I Propose a Counteroffer?**\n  - To beat both my previous proposal\u2019s value (573) and make an offer slightly more favorable than the current acceptance. Consider another distribution to maximize the result and ensure better final satisfaction or bargaining leverage.\n\nGiven these considerations and that the current offer is better than the outside offer, it's practical to:\n- Accept the current offer as it's competitive relative to the outside offer and could ensure a suitable negotiation outcome before further reduction from round discounting affects profitability.\n\nTherefore, the rational decision is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Any offer I propose should not lead to mistakes 1 through 5 outlined in the instructions.\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffer Calculation**:\n   - Since my total value (1203) needs to be preserved, I'll initially examine a distribution where my value exceeds 978.\n   - Consider keeping:\n     - 2 units of item 1 (value = 162)\n     - 3 units of item 2 (value = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129)\n     - 5 units of item 3 (value = 5 \u00d7 50 = 250)\n     - 2 units of item 4 (value = 166)\n     - 1 unit of item 5 (value = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90)\n\n   - Calculate my value:\n     \\[\n     162 + 129 + 250 + 166 + 90 = 797\n     \\]\n   - This offer leaves too much value to Player 2, as my value (797) is less than my outside offer (978). I need to adjust the distribution.\n\n4. **Adjust Offer**:\n   - Aim to retain higher value items, especially item 5 as it has a high per unit value.\n   - Propose keeping all of item 1 and item 4, more units of item 5, given its high value.\n   - Propose a new distribution:\n     - 2 units of item 1 (value = 162) \u2014 keep all\n     - 2 units of item 2 (value = 86)\n     - 3 units of item 3 (value = 150)\n     - 1 units of item 4 (value = 83)\n     - 2 units of item 5 (value = 180)\n   - Calculate adjusted value:\n     \\[\n     162 + 86 + 150 + 83 + 180 = 671\n     \\]\n\n   - This total is similarly low. Explore retaining higher amounts of item 5.\n\n### Make a Decision:\n\nGiven the challenge in creating an initial offer that maintains my own payoff above my outside offer of 978, while meeting the constraints (without extensive trial-error iteration here), it is best to propose an offer that rapidly approaches the outside offer level:\n\n**Propose Offering 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 5 to Player 2. My Offer = [0, 2, 3, 0, 1]:**\n\n1. **Value of My Keepings**:\n   - Item 1: 2 units = 162\n   - Item 2: 3 units = 129\n   - Item 3: 3 units = 150\n   - Item 4: 2 units = 166\n   - Item 5: 3 units = 270\n   - My Total: 877\n\nThis formulation aims to provide a balanced offer while fine-tuning toward a strategy close to the outside offer.

That's interesting.\n\n## Step 4: Make a decision\n\nGiven that:\n1. The current offer's value (328) is much better than my outside offer (22)\n2. When I tried to construct a reasonable counteroffer, I arrived at the same distribution\n\nThis suggests the current offer is already fair and benefits me significantly. While I could try to negotiate for even more value, there's risk in prolonging negotiations due to the discount factor.\n\nI should accept this offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 4, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

Thus, it's important to consider the discounted value when weighing whether to wait for potentially better future offers.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer:** There is no current offer on the table.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider possible divisions of items that could maximize my value compared to the outside offer.\n   - Let\u2019s calculate a potential offer where I maximize my remaining value.\n     - If I keep all items: \n       - Total value = 1\u00d740 + 4\u00d745 + 4\u00d747 + 4\u00d789 + 4\u00d759 = 1312\n     - I must propose offers where my value remains above or at least matches my outside offer value of 963.\n\n3) **Propose a Specific Counteroffer:**\n\n   - Considering Mistake 2 (offering a value below my outside offer), I should make sure any offer I propose keeps my total value above 963.\n   - Let's assume a scenario where I give Player 2 one unit of each item. My value calculation results in:\n     - [0, 3, 3, 3, 3] to Player 2 and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to me:\n       - My value = 1\u00d740 + 1\u00d745 + 1\u00d747 + 1\u00d789 + 1\u00d759 = 280\n     - Clearly, keeping only one unit of each high-value item isn't optimal.\n\n   - Reconfigure items so my value is greater or equal to my outside offer. Another possible offer:\n     - Offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] to Player 2, and keep [1, 4, 4, 3, 3] for myself.\n     - My value becomes:\n       - 1\u00d740 + 4\u00d745 + 4\u00d747 + 3\u00d789 + 3\u00d759 = 1155\n     - This value is greater than my outside offer of 963, thus acceptable and beneficial to pursue.\n\nGiven this analysis, my proposed initial offer to Player 2 is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 4, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 0 + 45 x 4 + 47 x 4 + 89 x 4 + 59 x 4\n    which is 960 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 963. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, let's carefully evaluate the current situation and the available options:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 963.\n- **Values of the Items**: \n  - Item 1: 40\n  - Item 2: 45\n  - Item 3: 47\n  - Item 4: 89\n  - Item 5: 59\n- **Total Pool of Items**: There are 1 unit of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5.\n- **Discount Factor Influence**: Since we are in round 2, if the negotiation concludes in this round, the value of any deal will be multiplied by the discount factor \\( \\gamma^{r-1} \\) where \\( r = 2 \\). This means the value is multiplied by 0.9.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**:  \n  I am offered [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]. Calculate my total value:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 40 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n  - Total value = 480\n  - Adjusted for round 2 discount: 480 \u00d7 0.9 = 432\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**:\n  - Current offer value (432) is much less than my outside offer value (963).\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  To surpass my outside offer, any proposal must yield a present value exceeding 963. Given that the highest round 2 agreement needs to exceed a nominal value of 1063 due to the \\(0.9\\) discount, I should aim for a division where the calculation results in more than 1063. \n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\nThe objective is to propose a counteroffer that surpasses the value of my outside offer after considering the discount factor, while avoiding negotiation mistakes.\n\n#### Exploring a Possible Counteroffer\nLet's calculate a possible division that might surpass my outside offer's value:\n\n- If I kept [1, 3, 3, 3, 3], my value would be:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n  - Total = 760\n  - Discounted to = 760 \u00d7 0.9 = 684\n\nSince this value does not surpass my outside offer, I need to keep more of the high-value items, especially since item 4 has a very high value for me.\n\nAfter testing various combinations, I conclude:\n- **Counteroffer Candidate**: Keep [1, 4, 4, 4, 3], offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]:\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 45 = 180\n  - 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 47 = 188\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 89 = 356\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177\n  - Total = 941\n  - Discounted to = 941 \u00d7 0.9 = 846.9\n\nStill less than 963.\n\nUltimately, after calculations, no deal or counteroffer in this round reaches my outside offer's value post-discounting. Therefore, the optimal solution is to walk away, ensuring I receive my outside offer.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 315.\n- **Values of Items:**\n  - Item 1: 28 per unit\n  - Item 2: 23 per unit\n  - Item 3: 48 per unit\n  - Item 4: 18 per unit\n  - Item 5: 34 per unit\n- **Total Pool of Items:** \n  - Item 1: 7 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 4: 4 units\n  - Item 5: 0 units\n- **Discount Factor (Gamma = 0.9):** In the second round, if I accept an offer, the value is adjusted by the discount factor, which would be \\(0.9^1 = 0.9\\).\n\n### 2. Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer on the Table:** [2, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n  - Calculating the value of this offer to me:\n    - 5 units of Item 1 (7 - 2) = 5 x 28 = 140\n    - 3 units of Item 2 (3 - 0) = 3 x 23 = 69\n    - 3 units of Item 3 (6 - 3) = 3 x 48 = 144\n    - 1 unit of Item 4 (4 - 3) = 1 x 18 = 18\n    - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 x 34 = 0\n  - Total Value = 140 + 69 + 144 + 18 + 0 = 371\n  - Adjusting for Discount Factor: 371 x 0.9 = 333.9\n\nSince the discounted value of the current offer (333.9) is greater than my outside offer (315), the current offer is better than the fallback option.\n\n### 3. Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n- Accepting the current offer yields a value (333.9) to me that's greater than my outside offer (315).\n- I should avoid walking away, as that would give me only 315.\n- Formulating a counteroffer risks the valuation diminishing further due to the discount factor and possibly leading to an impasse in round 3, where Player 2 can still walk away if not satisfied.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, accepting the current offer is a sensible choice as it presents a better value than my outside offer. \n\nTherefore, my action is:  \n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    75 x 0 + 47 x 1 + 76 x 0 + 38 x 0 + 45 x 0\n    which is 47 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 68. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 564. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 405 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 5, 2, 2, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 7 + 36 x 5 + 18 x 2 + 45 x 2 + 5 x 8\n    which is 563 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 564. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer carefully to determine my best action.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 564\n- My item values: item 1 = 31, item 2 = 36, item 3 = 18, item 4 = 45, item 5 = 5\n- Total pool of items: 7 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, 8 of item 5\n- Current discount factor: Since it's round 1, gamma^(1-1) = 1, so no discount yet\n\n## Step 2: Assess the value of the current offer\n\nThe current offer from Player 1 gives me:\n- 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 31 = 0\n- 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n- 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n- 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n\nTotal value of this offer to me: 36 + 45 = 81\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 564, so accepting would be a mistake.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate what I would keep with this offer\n\nIf I accept, Player 1 keeps:\n- 7 units of item 1\n- 5 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 1 unit of item 4\n- 8 units of item 5\n\nThis gives me only 81 value, which is far below my outside offer.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a counteroffer\n\nI need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value of 564.\n\nLet me try keeping most of the high-value items while offering some lower-value items:\n- If I keep 7 units of item 1: 7 \u00d7 31 = 217\n- If I keep 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 36 = 180\n- If I keep 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n- If I keep 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n- If I keep 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 5 = 30\n\nTotal value if I keep these: 217 + 180 + 36 + 90 + 30 = 553\n\nThis is slightly less than my outside offer. Let me adjust by keeping 7 units of item 5:\n- With 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 5 = 35\n- New total: 217 + 180 + 36 + 90 + 35 = 558\n\nThis is still below my outside offer. Let me keep all of item 5:\n- With 8 units of item 5: 8 \u00d7 5 = 40\n- New total: 217 + 180 + 36 + 90 + 40 = 563\n\nI'm still just below my outside offer. Let me try a different approach:\n- Keep all of item 1 (7 units): 7 \u00d7 31 = 217\n- Keep all of item 2 (5 units): 5 \u00d7 36 = 180\n- Keep 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n- Keep all of item 4 (2 units): 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n- Keep all of item 5 (8 units): 8 \u00d7 5 = 40\n\nTotal: 217 + 180 + 36 + 90 + 40 = 563\n\nThis is still slightly below my outside offer. I'll need to offer even less. The only item I'm offering is 1 unit of item 3, worth 18 to me.\n\nLet's try:\n- Keep all of item 1, item 2, item 4, and item 5\n- Keep 3 units of item 3\n\nValue: 217 + 180 + (3 \u00d7 18) + 90 + 40 = 217 + 180 + 54 + 90 + 40 = 581\n\nThis equals my total value of all items, meaning I would offer nothing to Player 1. But that's mistake #3.\n\nSince I need to offer something reasonable while ensuring my value exceeds my outside offer, I'll offer a small amount of the items I value least:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keep all 7)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keep all 5)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (keep 2)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keep all 2)\n- 3 units of item 5 (keep 5)\n\nMy value for this: (7 \u00d7 31) + (5 \u00d7 36) + (2 \u00d7 18) + (2 \u00d7 45) + (5 \u00d7 5) = 217 + 180 + 36 + 90 + 25 = 548\n\nThis is less than my outside offer. I need to keep more.\n\nLet me try:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keep all 7)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keep all 5) \n- 1 unit of item 3 (keep 2)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keep all 2)\n- 2 units of item 5 (keep 6)\n\nMy value: 217 + 180 + 36 + 90 + (6 \u00d7 5) = 217 + 180 + 36 + 90 + 30 = 553\n\nStill not enough. Let me try a final adjustment:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keep all 7)\n- 0 units of item 2 (keep all 5)\n- 0 units of item 3 (keep all 3)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keep all 2)\n- 3 units of item 5 (keep 5)\n\nMy value: 217 + 180 + 54 + 90 + 25 = 566\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer of 564. So my counteroffer to Player 1 will be [0, 0, 0, 0, 3].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]}",

We're in round 2, so the effective factor is \\( \\gamma^{(2-1)} = 0.9 \\).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer on the Table:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\n  Let's calculate the total value if I accept it. The values of items offered are:\n  \\[\n  0 \\times 77 + 0 \\times 85 + 0 \\times 58 + 0 \\times 70 + 3 \\times 1 = 3\n  \\]\n\n  Applying the discount factor:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 0.9 = 2.7\n  \\]\n\n  This value is significantly lower than my outside offer of 490.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:** \n\n  We need to make sure any counteroffer exceeds the value of 490. Let's determine a counteroffer:\n  - Suppose we take all units of item 1 and 2: keeping [7, 5, x, y, z] where \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\) are units we take.\n  - We aim to keep value more than 490, meaning we need:\n    \\[\n    7 \\times 77 + 5 \\times 85 + x \\times 58 + y \\times 70 + z \\times 1 > 490\n    \\]\n\n  Calculating values:\n  - Total from items 1 and 2: \\( 7 \\times 77 + 5 \\times 85 = 539 + 425 = 964 \\).\n\nThis division gives me a value of 964, which is much higher than 490, our fallback value. Since we have units remaining, I'll think of a reasonable allocation:\n\n- Total units given to Player 2 in these conditions: [0, 0, 3, 2, 8]. This leaves me with no items at this high value. Therefore, I could offer more items to create equilibrium with my fallback.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision\n\nSince the current offer from Player 2 is far below my outside offer value, I cannot accept it. A counteroffer is needed:\n\nGiven the tendency of this scenario and preference to keep most of the value while not offering all items or nothing (avoid suboptimal moves), my counteroffer should be prudent but advantageous. I've decided on:\n\n- **Offer:** [0, 0, 1, 1, 6]\n  - Value to me:\n    \\[\n    7 \\times 77 + 5 \\times 85 + 2 \\times 58 + 1 \\times 70 + 2 \\times 1 = 154 + 70 + 2 = 226 (to adjust and leave acceptable division)\n    \\]\n\nBased on the maximum return, my counteroffer should give me benefits rivaling the outside fallback. Therefore my counter PDF move is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 6]}\n```\n\nHere, I allocate reasonable numbers to enhance the value compared to the outside offer, making it more lucrative than walking away or accepting the subpar current proposition.",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 5, 2, 2, 8] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    31 x 7 + 36 x 5 + 18 x 2 + 45 x 2 + 5 x 8\n    which is 563 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 564. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 6]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 6]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I need to evaluate the current offer on the table and decide whether to accept, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Current Situation:\n- My outside offer value: 564\n- My item values: 31 for item 1, 36 for item 2, 18 for item 3, 45 for item 4, 5 for item 5\n- Total pool: 7 units of item 1, 5 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 8 units of item 5\n- We're in round 2, so the discount factor is \u03b3^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n### 2. Assess the Value of the Current Offer:\nPlayer 1 is offering me: [0, 0, 1, 1, 6]\nThis means I would get:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 31 = 0\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 36 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 45 = 45\n- 6 units of item 5: 6 \u00d7 5 = 30\nTotal value = 93\n\nWith discount factor: 93 \u00d7 0.9 = 83.7\n\nThis is significantly below my outside offer of 564, so I should NOT accept this offer.\n\n### 3. Consider a Counteroffer:\nLet me propose a counteroffer where I keep most of the high-value items (for me):\n\nIf I offer Player 1: [0, 0, 1, 0, 5]\n\nThat means I keep:\n- 7 units of item 1: 7 \u00d7 31 = 217\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 36 = 180\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\nTotal value = 538\n\nWith discount: 538 \u00d7 0.9 = 484.2\n\nThis is below my outside offer of 564.\n\nLet me try another offer. If I offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\n\nThat means I keep:\n- 7 units of item 1: 7 \u00d7 31 = 217\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 36 = 180\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\nTotal value = 561\n\nWith discount: 561 \u00d7 0.9 = 504.9\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 564.\n\nLet me try offering even less to Player 1. If I offer Player 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n\nThat means I keep:\n- 7 units of item 1: 7 \u00d7 31 = 217\n- 5 units of item 2: 5 \u00d7 36 = 180\n- 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 45 = 90\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 5 = 25\nTotal value = 566\n\nWith discount: 566 \u00d7 0.9 = 509.4\n\nThis is still below my outside offer of 564.\n\n### 4. Decision:\nSince we're already in round 2, and the discount factor is reducing the value of any potential deal, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer that exceeds my outside offer value. Even keeping almost everything and offering minimal items to Player 1 results in a discounted value lower than my outside offer.\n\nThe most rational choice is to walk away and take my outside offer of 564.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

The value of the offer will decrease with each round, which incentivizes me to conclude the negotiation sooner rather than later if a satisfactory offer is available.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **No Current Offer:** There is currently no offer from Player 2.\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  Let's consider some potential divisions and their values for me. I'll aim for a division that yields a value greater than my outside offer of 341.\n\n  - **Potential Division [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (give nothing):**\n    - My value: 5 \u00d7 32 + 3 \u00d7 27 + 2 \u00d7 55 + 8 \u00d7 58 + 7 \u00d7 89 = 1438 (this is unreasonable as it offers nothing to Player 2)\n  \n  - **Potential Division [2, 1, 1, 3, 4]:**\n    - My items: [3, 2, 1, 5, 3]\n    - My value: 3 \u00d7 32 + 2 \u00d7 27 + 1 \u00d7 55 + 5 \u00d7 58 + 3 \u00d7 89 = 568\n\n  - **Potential Division [3, 1, 1, 2, 5]:**\n    - My items: [2, 2, 1, 6, 2]\n    - My value: 2 \u00d7 32 + 2 \u00d7 27 + 1 \u00d7 55 + 6 \u00d7 58 + 2 \u00d7 89 = 592\n\nBoth potential divisions listed above yield a value significantly higher than my outside offer of 341.

Assessing the value of current offer:\nPlayer 1 is offering me [3, 1, 1, 2, 5] units of the items.\n\nValue of this offer to me:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132\n- 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 43 = 215\n- Total value = 568\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 595.\n\n### 3. Planning a counteroffer:\nI need to analyze what items are most valuable to me and propose a division that maximizes my value while still being potentially acceptable to Player 1.\n\nMy highest-value items are:\n- Item 4 (77 per unit)\n- Item 2 (48 per unit)\n- Item 1 (44 per unit)\n- Item 5 (43 per unit)\n- Item 3 (19 per unit)\n\nLet me try offering Player 1 [2, 1, 1, 2, 3], which means I keep [3, 2, 1, 6, 4]:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132\n- 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n- 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n- 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 77 = 462\n- 4 units of item 5 = 4 \u00d7 43 = 172\n- Total value = 881\n\nThis is much better than my outside offer of 595 and gives a reasonable amount to Player 1.\n\n### Decision:\nSince the current offer (568) is less than my outside offer (595), I should not accept it. Making a counteroffer is better than walking away immediately since I can propose a division that gives me much more value (881).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 3]}",

                    "response": "To decide on the action I'll take in this negotiation round, let's analyze and calculate as required step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value:**\n   - My outside offer is valued at 217.\n\n2. **Values of the Items Involved:**\n   - Item 1: 61 per unit.\n   - Item 2: 8 per unit.\n   - Item 3: 36 per unit.\n   - Item 4: 25 per unit.\n   - Item 5: 46 per unit.\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items:**\n   - Item 1: 4 units.\n   - Item 2: 4 units.\n   - Item 3: 3 units.\n   - Item 4: 3 units.\n   - Item 5: 2 units.\n\n4. **Discount Factor Influence:**\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. We are in round 2, so the value of any deal accepted now is multiplied by \\(0.9^{1} = 0.9\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] (Offered to me)**\n   - Calculate the value of the items I would receive:\n     - 1 unit of Item 1 = 1 \u00d7 61 = 61\n     - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n     - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 36 = 36\n     - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50\n     - 1 unit of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n   - Total immediate value: 61 + 16 + 36 + 50 + 46 = 209\n   - Discounted value: 209 \u00d7 0.9 = 188.1\n\n2. **Comparison to Outside Offer:**\n   - The current offer's value to me (188.1) is less than my outside offer value (217).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Current Offer:** The current offer provides a discounted value of 188.1, which is less than my outside offer of 217.\n- **Action Decision:** It would be a mistake to accept an offer that yields a lower value than my outside offer. Therefore, I can either WALK or propose a counteroffer that provides more value than 217.\n\n#### Exploring Potential Counteroffer\n- Aim for a division where my received value is greater than 217.\n- Let's construct an example counteroffer that aims to ensure my received value after discounting is above 217.\n\nCounteroffer example: Keep [3, 0, 2, 0, 1] for myself, offer [1, 4, 1, 3, 1] to Player 2.\n- My value from this division:\n  - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183\n  - 0 units of Item 2 = 0 \u00d7 8 = 0\n  - 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 36 = 72\n  - 0 units of Item 4 = 0 \u00d7 25 = 0\n  - 1 units of Item 5 = 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n- Total immediate value: 183 + 0 + 72 + 0 + 46 = 301\n- Discounted value: 301 \u00d7 0.9 = 270.9\n\nSince 270.9 > 217, this is better than my outside offer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I will propose a counteroffer as this provides more value than both the current offer and my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 4, 1, 3, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 983. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 983. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 972 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 5, 0, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 4 + 100 x 5 + 49 x 0 + 58 x 1 + 22 x 2\n    which is 982 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 983. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Therefore, I should aim to keep items in a way that their total value exceeds 983.\n   - Let me calculate the value if I propose to keep specific units:\n     - If I keep [6, 6, 1, 1, 3], then:\n       - Value of 6 units of Item 1 = 6 \u00d7 95 = 570\n       - Value of 6 units of Item 2 = 6 \u00d7 100 = 600\n       - Value of 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n       - Value of 1 unit of Item 4 = 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n       - Value of 3 units of Item 5 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n       - Total value = 570 + 600 + 49 + 58 + 66 = 1343\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The value of keeping [6, 6, 1, 1, 3] is 1343, which is higher than my outside offer of 983.\n   - Therefore, I can safely propose the remaining items [0, 2, 3, 0, 2] to Player 2, ensuring that my payoff is above my outside offer and also testing the reaction of Player 2.\n\nHence, my proposed initial offer will be to offer Player 2 the following units: 0 units of Item 1, 2 units of Item 2, 3 units of Item 3, 0 units of Item 4, and 2 units of Item 5.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 3, 0, 2]}",
