Since this is a multi-round negotiation with a discount factor of 0.9, I should make a reasonable first offer that leaves room for compromise.\n\nMy strategy is to offer Player 2 some of the lower-value items while keeping most of the high-value ones.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 78 x 5 + 31 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 28 x 1\n    which is 418 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 419. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 5, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 78 x 5 + 31 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 28 x 1\n    which is 418 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 419. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Item 1 (97 per unit) - highest priority\n2. Item 5 (65 per unit)\n3. Item 4 (60 per unit)\n4. Item 3 (20 per unit)\n5. Item 2 (14 per unit) - lowest priority\n\nFor my initial offer, I should try to keep most high-value items for myself while offering enough to make the deal attractive to Player 2. Since my outside offer is 929, any deal should give me more than that.\n\nI'll offer Player 2:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (giving up 97 value)\n- 3 units of item 2 (giving up 42 value)\n- 2 units of item 3 (giving up 40 value)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping all)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (giving up 65 value)\n\nTotal value I'm giving up: 97 + 42 + 40 + 0 + 65 = 244, which means I keep 1052 - 244 = 808 for myself.\n\nThis offer is worth less than my outside option (808 < 929), but it's a starting point that leaves room for negotiation. I'll need to get a better deal in future rounds. If we don't reach an acceptable deal, I can always walk away.\n\nActually, upon reflection, I need to be more strategic. Since my outside offer is 929, I should keep more value for myself in this initial offer.\n\nLet me revise:\n- 0 units of item 1 (keeping all 6 units)\n- 3 units of item 2 (giving up 42 value)\n- 2 units of item 3 (giving up 40 value)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping all)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (giving up 65 value)\n\nTotal value I'm giving up: 0 + 42 + 40 + 0 + 65 = 147, which means I keep 1052 - 147 = 905 for myself.\n\nEven with the discount factor (0.9), this would be 905 \u00d7 0.9 = 814.5, which is still less than my outside offer.\n\nLet me try one more time to make a strategic initial offer:\n- 1 unit of item 1 (giving up 97 value)\n- 5 units of item 2 (giving up all 70 value)\n- 3 units of item 3 (giving up 60 value)\n- 0 units of item 4 (keeping all)\n- 0 units of item 5 (keeping all)\n\nThis gives Player 2 a total value of 227 from my perspective, and I keep 1052 - 227 = 825.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 5, 3, 0, 0]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 2, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 85 x 2 + 83 x 2 + 7 x 1 + 80 x 1\n    which is 423 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 424. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 572. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 572. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 44 = 132 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 558 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    20 x 1 + 24 x 0 + 27 x 2 + 71 x 7 + 44 x 0\n    which is 571 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 572. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If I accept an offer now, the value is adjusted by \\( \\gamma^{r-1} \\), which would be \\( 0.9^{2-1} = 0.9 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Value of Current Offer to Me:**\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 27 = 27\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 44 = 88\n  \n  Total value without discount = 20 + 48 + 27 + 355 + 88 = 538\n  \n  Apply discount for round 2: \\( 538 \\times 0.9 = 484.2 \\)\n\n- **My Outside Offer Value:** 572\n\n- Compare the current offer's discounted value (484.2) with my outside offer (572).

Given that Player 2 has been consistent about wanting more of item 2 and none of item 4, they likely value item 2 highly and item 4 less. I could try one more counteroffer to get a better deal, but there's risk they'll walk away.\n\nAfter considering all options, I think the current offer is reasonable. It gives me a value of 529.0, which is significantly higher than my outside option. If I make another counteroffer and Player 2 walks away, I would get only 147.4.\n\nI'll accept the current offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 4 + 51 x 1 + 18 x 0 + 69 x 2 + 87 x 1\n    which is 444 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 445. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If I accept the offer in this round, there's no discount. If I wait for future rounds, my value will be multiplied by the discount factor.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer (to me: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])**: Let's calculate the total value.\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n  - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n  - Item 3: 1 \u00d7 18 = 18\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n  - Total = 267\n\nSince 267 is less than my outside offer value of 445, accepting this offer is not a better option.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to create a counteroffer where my total value exceeds 445.\n  - If I consider keeping 3 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5 (offering [1, 0, 1, 0, 0] to Player 1):\n    - Item 1: 84\n    - Item 2: 51\n    - Item 3: 90\n    - Item 4: 138\n    - Item 5: 87\n    - Total = 450\n\nThis potential distribution gives me a value of 450, which is better than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on my calculations, the current offer is not acceptable as it doesn't exceed my outside offer value. However, the counteroffer where I retain [3, 1, 5, 2, 1] units provides a value of 450, which is greater than my outside offer. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer giving Player 1 [1, 0, 1, 0, 0].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 445. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 51 = 153 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 1, 0, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 4 + 51 x 1 + 18 x 0 + 69 x 2 + 87 x 1\n    which is 444 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 445. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's analyze the current situation, assess the value of offers, and decide on a course of action step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** \n  - My outside offer value is 445.\n\n- **Values of the Items:**\n  - Item 1: 42 per unit\n  - Item 2: 51 per unit\n  - Item 3: 18 per unit\n  - Item 4: 69 per unit\n  - Item 5: 87 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:**\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 1 unit of item 2\n  - 6 units of item 3\n  - 2 units of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor:**\n  - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9. Since this is round 2, the multiplier for the value will be 0.9 to the power of (2-1), which is 0.9.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of the Current Offer\n\n- **Current Offer to Me ([2, 0, 2, 1, 1]):**\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n  - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 51 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n  - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 69 = 69\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n  - Total value to me = 84 + 0 + 36 + 69 + 87 = 276\n  - Adjusted for round 2 discount: 276 \u00d7 0.9 = 248.4\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Current Offer Value to My Outside Offer\n\n- **Comparison:**\n  - The adjusted value of the current offer (248.4) is much lower than my outside offer value of 445.\n\n### Step 4: Decision Making\n\nGiven that the current offer yields a value lower than my outside offer, I should not accept it. \n\n**Possible Actions:**\n1. **ACCEPT:** Not advisable as the value of the current offer is less than the outside offer.\n2. **WALK:** Walking would secure the outside offer value of 445.\n3. **COUNTEROFFER:** Propose an offer better than the current one to see if a better deal can be reached.\n\n### Crafting a Counteroffer\n\nI must offer a division where the value of the items I keep is greater than 445 to justify making a counteroffer. Here's a balanced option to consider:\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n- **Units Kept by Me:** [3, 1, 4, 2, 1]\n  - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 51 = 51\n  - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 18 = 72\n  - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 69 = 138\n  - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 87 = 87\n  - Total value if I keep: 126 + 51 + 72 + 138 + 87 = 474\n\nSince 474 is greater than my outside offer value of 445, I avoid Mistake 2 and have a reasonable counteroffer. The aim is to improve the current offer without making any mistakes.\n\nGiven the above calculations and balancing, I'll choose to propose this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 0]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 10 x 1 + 76 x 2 + 94 x 4 + 95 x 7\n    which is 1203 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1204. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 4 + 26 x 0 + 76 x 0 + 84 x 0 + 34 x 0\n    which is 20 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 21. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I'll offer Player 2 most of item 3 and some of item 4, keeping all of item 2 and item A5 for myself.\n\nMy initial offer (what I give to Player 2):\n- Item 1: 0 units (there are 0 available)\n- Item 2: 0 units (keeping all 3 for myself)\n- Item 3: 4 units (keeping 1 for myself)\n- Item 4: 1 unit (keeping 2 for myself)\n- Item 5: 0 units (keeping all 2 for myself)\n\nThis means I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1 (0 value)\n- 3 units of item 2 (273 value)\n- 1 unit of item 3 (5 value)\n- 2 units of item 4 (70 value)\n- 2 units of item 5 (90 value)\n\nMy total value: 438, which is above my outside offer of 416.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 4, 1, 0]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 205. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 205. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 267 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 5, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    1 x 0 + 22 x 3 + 16 x 5 + 29 x 2 + 21 x 0\n    which is 204 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 205. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, I will walk through the analysis step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **My outside offer value:** 205\n- **Values of the items involved:** \n  - Item 1: 1\n  - Item 2: 22\n  - Item 3: 16\n  - Item 4: 29\n  - Item 5: 21\n\n- **Total pool of items:**\n  - 0 units of item 1\n  - 3 units of item 2\n  - 5 units of item 3\n  - 3 units of item 4\n  - 2 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount factor:** \\( \\gamma = 0.9 \\)\n\nThe discount factor influences the value by reducing the payoff of future rounds. In round 1, this factor does not apply, as any acceptance decision is based directly on the values without discount. However, rejecting favorable offers becomes less attractive in later rounds due to the discount rate.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current offer on the table (from Player 1):** [0, 0, 4, 1, 0]\n\n  - My total value if I accept:\n    - 0 units of item 1 = \\( 0 \\times 1 = 0 \\)\n    - 0 units of item 2 = \\( 0 \\times 22 = 0 \\)\n    - 4 units of item 3 = \\( 4 \\times 16 = 64 \\)\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = \\( 1 \\times 29 = 29 \\)\n    - 0 units of item 5 = \\( 0 \\times 21 = 0 \\)\n    - **Total value** = \\( 0 + 0 + 64 + 29 + 0 = 93 \\)\n    \n  This value of 93 is significantly less than my outside offer of 205. Accepting the offer would be a mistake.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:** \n  I need to find a division that gives me a total value higher than my outside offer of 205. I need to try different combinations for a potential counteroffer.\n\n  - For example, trying [0, 3, 2, 2, 1]:\n    - 0 units of item 1 = \\( 0 \\times 1 = 0 \\)\n    - 3 units of item 2 = \\( 3 \\times 22 = 66 \\)\n    - 2 units of item 3 = \\( 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\)\n    - 2 units of item 4 = \\( 2 \\times 29 = 58 \\)\n    - 1 unit of item 5 = \\( 1 \\times 21 = 21 \\)\n    - **Total value** = \\( 0 + 66 + 32 + 58 + 21 = 177 \\)\n\nThe counteroffer [0, 3, 2, 2, 1] totals 177, still less than my outside offer of 205. I need to adjust it to increase my value further.\n\n- Try another counteroffer [0, 3, 3, 2, 1]:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = \\( 0 \\times 1 = 0 \\)\n  - 3 units of item 2 = \\( 3 \\times 22 = 66 \\)\n  - 3 units of item 3 = \\( 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\)\n  - 2 units of item 4 = \\( 2 \\times 29 = 58 \\)\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = \\( 1 \\times 21 = 21 \\)\n  - **Total value** = \\( 0 + 66 + 48 + 58 + 21 = 193 \\)\n\nThis configuration still doesn't exceed my outside offer of 205.\n\n- Trying another potential counteroffer [0, 3, 4, 2, 0]:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = \\( 0 \\times 1 = 0 \\)\n  - 3 units of item 2 = \\( 3 \\times 22 = 66 \\)\n  - 4 units of item 3 = \\( 4 \\times 16 = 64 \\)\n  - 2 units of item 4 = \\( 2 \\times 29 = 58 \\)\n  - 0 units of item 5 = \\( 0 \\times 21 = 0 \\)\n  - **Total value** = \\( 0 + 66 + 64 + 58 + 0 = 188 \\)\n\nContinuing with adjustments is required until I can propose a division that gives me a value of at least 206 or more.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- **Accept the current offer:** No, the value of 93 is less than my outside offer of 205. That would be mistake number 4.\n- **Walk away:** No, not immediately, as an acceptable counteroffer might still be possible.\n- **Propose a counteroffer:** Yes, I should try to negotiate for a better division that maximizes my value.\n\nAfter calculating several alternatives, realize that obtaining a markedly better configuration within the constraints that I justified is tough without more precise values known for Player 1. Thus, the best configuration I can strategically consider while still hoping for cooperation is:\n\n- Proposal: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1], a strong counter from me, keeping most of the value.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}",

Walking away is better than accepting.\n\nHowever, I can try to make a better counteroffer. Player 2 seems interested in items 3, 4, and 5. Given my values, I care most about item 2 (91 points each). I should keep all of item 2 and offer Player 2 most of the lower-value items.\n\nLet me try a counteroffer where I keep all of item 2 (value 91) and some of the other items:\n- I'll offer Player 2: [0, 0, 4, 2, 1]\n- This leaves me with: [0, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n- My value: (0\u00d72) + (3\u00d791) + (1\u00d75) + (1\u00d735) + (1\u00d745) = 0 + 273 + 5 + 35 + 45 = 358\n\nEven if this gets accepted in round 3 (358 \u00d7 0.81 = 290), it's worse than walking away (416).\n\nLet me try a more aggressive counteroffer:\n- I'll offer Player 2: [0, 0, 3, 2, 1]\n- This leaves me with: [0, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n- My value: (0\u00d72) + (3\u00d791) + (2\u00d75) + (1\u00d735) + (1\u00d745) = 0 + 273 + 10 + 35 + 45 = 363\n\nThis is still not enough to beat my outside offer when discounted to round 3.\n\nSince my outside offer (416) is quite high compared to what I can get from negotiation, and we're already in round 2, the most rational action is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 523. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 73 = 219 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 993 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 4, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    64 x 0 + 22 x 4 + 72 x 4 + 100 x 0 + 73 x 2\n    which is 522 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 523. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 3, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    58 x 0 + 72 x 3 + 97 x 3 + 50 x 3 + 93 x 2\n    which is 843 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 844. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step-by-step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value: 844.\n   - Values of the items involved:\n     - Item 1: 58 per unit\n     - Item 2: 72 per unit\n     - Item 3: 97 per unit\n     - Item 4: 50 per unit\n     - Item 5: 93 per unit\n   - Total pool of items: \n     - Item 1: 2 units\n     - Item 2: 5 units\n     - Item 3: 3 units\n     - Item 4: 6 units\n     - Item 5: 4 units\n   - Discount factor: 0.9\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 1: [1, 1, 0, 3, 2] (which means they give me 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5)\n     - My total value for the current offer:\n       - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 x 58 = 58\n       - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 x 72 = 72\n       - 0 units of item 3 = 0 x 97 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 4 = 3 x 50 = 150\n       - 2 units of item 5 = 2 x 93 = 186\n     - Total value = 58 + 72 + 150 + 186 = 466\n    \n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 466, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 844.\n   - Walking away will guarantee me a value of 844, which is higher than the current offer's value.\n\nGiven that the current offer is much lower than my outside offer, a rational decision would be to propose a counteroffer or walk away. So now, I need to consider a counteroffer that is better than my outside offer of 844.\n\nLet's find a better division. A balanced approach is to propose keeping more units of high-value items (like item 3 and 5) as they give higher value per unit:\n\nCounteroffer examination:\nAssume I keep [0, 4, 2, 3, 2] for myself and offer the rest to Player 1, which means I want to propose giving them [2, 1, 1, 3, 2].\n\n- My potential value for this counteroffer:\n  - 0 unit of item 1 = 0 x 58 = 0\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 x 72 = 288\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 x 97 = 194\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 x 50 = 150\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 x 93 = 186\n- Total value for this proposed counteroffer = 818\n\nSince the proposed counteroffer value of 818 is still less than my outside offer of 844, I would continue adjusting the offer until it is better than my outside offer, or aim for a strategic walk.\n\nGiven the above, the best course of action is to walk away if I cannot make a counteroffer better than the outside offer. For now, my decision would be:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 2, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    53 x 0 + 58 x 3 + 86 x 2 + 94 x 2 + 59 x 5\n    which is 829 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 830. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Next, let's offer [1, 2, 1, 0, 4] to Player 1:\n         - I keep [2, 3, 1, 3, 2].\n         - Calculating my values:\n           - Item 1: 2 x 53 = 106\n           - Item 2: 3 x 58 = 174\n           - Item 3: 1 x 86 = 86\n           - Item 4: 3 x 94 = 282\n           - Item 5: 2 x 59 = 118\n           - Total value = 766\n           - After discounting = 766 x 0.9 = 689.4 (again not beneficial compared to the outside option).\n\n     The evaluated potential counteroffers clearly show none improve better than my outside offer value. Therefore, it would make no sense to make a counteroffer lower than the outside offer after considering the discount factor unless I receive an offer better than my outside option. \n\n3) Decision:\n   - The current offer valued at 417.6 discounted is lower than my outside offer value of 830.\n   - All examined counteroffers result in values less than my outside offer when adjusted for discounting.\n   - Given these calculations, the best course of action is to WALK away and take my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Item 1 (5 per unit)\n\nMy strategy is to keep all of item 4 (my highest value), most of item 3, and offer Player 2 the items that are worth less to me:\n\nFor my initial offer (what I'll give to Player 2):\n- Item 1: 4 units (all units, worth 20 to me)\n- Item 2: 0 units (keep it for myself, worth 21 to me)\n- Item 3: 1 unit (give 1 out of 5, worth 45 to me)\n- Item 4: 0 units (keep all for myself, worth 396 to me)\n- Item 5: 2 units (give 2 out of 3, worth 42 to me)\n\nThis offer gives Player 2 items worth 107 to me, while I keep items worth 618 to me.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 0, 1, 0, 2]}",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 746. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 746. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 957 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 2, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 2 + 28 x 0 + 36 x 2 + 81 x 4 + 94 x 2\n    which is 744 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 746. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n   - **Outside Offer Value:** Your outside offer value is 746.\n   \n   - **Values of Items:** \n     - Item 1: 80 per unit\n     - Item 2: 28 per unit\n     - Item 3: 36 per unit\n     - Item 4: 81 per unit\n     - Item 5: 94 per unit\n\n   - **Total Pool of Items:** \n     - 4 units of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 5 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n\n   - **Discount Factor:** As this is round 1, the discount factor is not applied yet. However, it will become relevant in future rounds. The value of an offer in future rounds will be multiplied by \\(0.9^{r-1}\\), where \\(r\\) is the round number.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer Evaluation:** The current offer provides you with [4, 0, 1, 0, 2].\n\n     - Total value to you if you accept:\n       - 4 units of item 1: \\(4 \\times 80 = 320\\)\n       - 0 units of item 2: \\(0 \\times 28 = 0\\)\n       - 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 36 = 36\\)\n       - 0 units of item 4: \\(0 \\times 81 = 0\\)\n       - 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 94 = 188\\)\n\n     - Total value = \\(320 + 0 + 36 + 0 + 188 = 544\\)\n\n   - **Comparison with Outside Offer:** The value of the current offer (544) is less than your outside offer (746).\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n\n   Based on the above analysis, we should not accept the current offer because its value (544) is lower than your outside offer (746). Walking away right now guarantees you a value of 746. Alternatively, you can consider making a counteroffer that increases your value beyond 746.\n\n   **Propose a Counteroffer:**\n\n   Let's propose a counteroffer such that its value to you is greater than 746. For example, offering Player 1 [0, 0, 3, 0, 1] could be a beneficial counteroffer:\n\n   - You keep [4, 1, 2, 4, 2] and offer [0, 0, 3, 0, 1] to Player 1.\n\n   - Your value:\n     - 4 units of item 1: \\(4 \\times 80 = 320\\)\n     - 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 28 = 28\\)\n     - 2 units of item 3: \\(2 \\times 36 = 72\\)\n     - 4 units of item 4: \\(4 \\times 81 = 324\\)\n     - 2 units of item 5: \\(2 \\times 94 = 188\\)\n\n   - Total value = \\(320 + 28 + 72 + 324 + 188 = 932\\)\n\n   Since 932 is greater than 746, this counteroffer is better than your outside offer.\n\n   Therefore, I will propose this specific counteroffer:\n\n   {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 3, 0, 1]}",

Therefore, I will counteroffer:\n\nI propose to give Player 1: 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 2, 0, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 3, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 2 + 86 x 1 + 12 x 3 + 63 x 6 + 71 x 2\n    which is 694 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 695. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 3, 6, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 2 + 86 x 1 + 12 x 3 + 63 x 6 + 71 x 2\n    which is 694 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 695. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 5, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [5, 0, 4, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 6, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 6, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 16 x 1 + 58 x 1 + 10 x 0\n    which is 74 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 78. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 3, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 3, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 548. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1101 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 4, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    43 x 1 + 84 x 4 + 90 x 0 + 56 x 3 + 94 x 0\n    which is 547 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 548. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 5, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 5, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    22 x 0 + 25 x 2 + 29 x 1 + 5 x 1 + 65 x 1\n    which is 149 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 150. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [4, 0, 0, 3, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [4, 0, 0, 3, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Yes, the value of the current offer (363) is substantially higher than my outside offer (150).\n   - Walking away would result in a lower payoff of 150, so walking wouldn't be optimal here.\n   - Proposing a counteroffer might not yield a better result, as I have no information on Player 1's private values or their outside offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 6, 10, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 16 x 0 + 74 x 6 + 18 x 10 + 8 x 5\n    which is 664 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 665. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 8, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 8, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 665. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 483 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 6, 10, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 0 + 16 x 0 + 74 x 6 + 18 x 10 + 8 x 5\n    which is 664 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 665. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 8, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 11, 6]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 10, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 10, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Since it is round 2, the factor is 1 for round 1 and will be 0.9 for round 2 and 0.81 for round 3.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer ([0, 1, 2, 10, 4])**:\n     - Value = (0 * 45) + (1 * 16) + (2 * 74) + (10 * 18) + (4 * 8)\n     - Value = 0 + 16 + 148 + 180 + 32 = 376\n\n   The current offer provides me a value of 376, which is less than my outside offer of 665.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - **Accepting the current offer:** This would give me a value of 376, which is less than my outside offer of 665, so I should not accept it.\n   \n   - **Walking away:** My outside offer guarantees me a value of 665. Thus, if I can't make a better counteroffer or expect such from Player 1, walking away is preferable.\n\n   - **Proposing a counteroffer:** I need to propose an offer that is valued above 665 to make it worthwhile considering the discount factor. For instance, if I keep [1, 0, 5, 12, 5], it gives:\n     - 1 * 45 + 0 * 16 + 5 * 74 + 12 * 18 + 5 * 8 = 45 + 0 + 370 + 216 + 40 = 671 \n\n   Since this exceeds my outside offer, I will propose that as a counteroffer, knowing that any future benefit will be discounted and considering this is the mid-round of negotiations.\n\nAfter considering these options, the best strategic decision is to propose the following counteroffer:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 5, 0, 1]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 227. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 28 = 84 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 4, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 89 x 0 + 28 x 4 + 57 x 2 + 79 x 0\n    which is 226 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 227. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 227.\n   - The values of the items for me are:\n     - Item 1: 12\n     - Item 2: 89\n     - Item 3: 28\n     - Item 4: 57\n     - Item 5: 79\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 3 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 4 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the value of delayed offers. In this round, the power of gamma is \\(0\\), so the discount does not apply.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 1: [0, 1, 1, 3, 1]\n     - Value to me:\n       \\(0 \\times 12 + 1 \\times 89 + 1 \\times 28 + 3 \\times 57 + 1 \\times 79 = 0 + 89 + 28 + 171 + 79 = 367\\)\n   - My outside offer value is 227.\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer gives me a value of 367, which is higher than my outside offer value of 227.\n   - Accepting this offer means the negotiation concludes with a value of 367.\n   - There is no reason to WALK since the current offer is better than my outside offer.\n   - Counteroffering is not necessary as the current offer is already better than what I stand to gain from my outside offer.\n\nDecision:\nThe best course of action is to accept the current offer as it provides a higher value than my outside offer.
