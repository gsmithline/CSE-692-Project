By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 1 + 37 x 1 + 13 x 2 + 33 x 0 + 55 x 0\n    which is 113 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 114. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This means I get:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit, value = 1 * 50 = 50\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit, value = 1 * 37 = 37\n    *   Item 3: 1 unit, value = 1 * 13 = 13\n    *   Item 4: 0 units, value = 0 * 33 = 0\n    *   Item 5: 2 units, value = 2 * 55 = 110\n    *   Total value = 50 + 37 + 13 + 0 + 110 = 210\n\n*   **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer (210) is greater than my outside offer (114).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider what a beneficial counteroffer would look like if I rejected the current offer. The current offer is quite favorable, so I would need to construct a counteroffer where I get even more value. Let's consider what I would need to offer to player 1 to get a greater value for myself.\n\n*   **Mistake Avoidance:**\n    *   Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. Avoided, the current offer is much better than my outside offer.\n    *   Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    42 x 0 + 38 x 4 + 87 x 0 + 7 x 0 + 52 x 2\n    which is 256 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 257. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 1, 0, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value is 257.\n*   My values for the items are: item 1 = 42, item 2 = 38, item 3 = 87, item 4 = 7, item 5 = 52.\n*   The total pool of items is: 4 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5.\n*   The discount factor is 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 3 = 0 units\n    My value for this offer is: (2 * 42) + (3 * 38) + (3 * 87) + (4 * 7) + (0 * 52) = 84 + 114 + 261 + 28 + 0 = 487.\n    Since 487 is greater than my outside option of 257, accepting this offer is better than walking away *at this moment*.\n\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider if making a counteroffer could yield a higher discounted value in a later round, or if Player 1 is likely to accept the counteroffer. Since this is round 2 and there are 3 rounds in total, there is a maximum of one round left to negotiate.\n\n    Previous offers were:\n    Round 1 Player 1: [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n    Round 1 Player 2: [2, 1, 0, 1, 3]\n    Round 2 Player 1: [2, 1, 1, 1, 3]\n\n    Player 1 seems fixed on the offer [2, 1, 1, 1, 3].\n\n    Consider an alternative counteroffer. Try to get more value from Player 1, especially for item 3, where my value is high. Perhaps, I can give up some item 4 where I have a low valuation.\n\n    Let's consider offering [2, 1, 0, 2, 3]. In this case, I get:\n    *   Item 1: 4 - 2 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n    *   Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n    *   Item 4: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 3 - 3 = 0 units\n    My value for this offer is: (2 * 42) + (3 * 38) + (4 * 87) + (3 * 7) + (0 * 52) = 84 + 114 + 348 + 21 + 0 = 567.\n\n    If Player 1 accepts this, it would be great, but it's unlikely Player 1 will accept a counteroffer that is significantly worse than their own offer.\n\n    Since Player 1 repeated their offer in round 2, there is a very high probability that they will walk away next turn if I do not accept, resulting in a guaranteed payoff of 257 (my outside offer) next round. Discounted by 0.9, this is only 257 * 0.9 = 231.3. So, unless I expect a significantly better payoff in round 3, it is more profitable to accept the current offer.\n\n    With the current offer, my value is 487. If I walk away next round, my discounted value is 231.3.\n    If I try to make a counteroffer that gets accepted, I can make slightly more, but the risk is that Player 1 might walk away if my offer is too greedy. Since the current offer is well above my outside option and I have only one round left, I am better off accepting the offer.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe best course of action is to ACCEPT the current offer because the current offer yields a value of 487, which is greater than my outside offer of 257, and greater than my outside offer discounted to the last round (231.3).\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 4, 0, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 6 + 70 x 4 + 5 x 0 + 57 x 2 + 83 x 6\n    which is 1192 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1193. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value: 1193\n   - My item values: item 1: 50, item 2: 70, item 3: 5, item 4: 57, item 5: 83\n   - Total item pool: item 1: 6, item 2: 5, item 3: 1, item 4: 2, item 5: 7\n   - Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less to me than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [1, 1, 1, 0, 4]. This means I receive:\n      - Item 1: 1 unit * 50 = 50\n      - Item 2: 1 unit * 70 = 70\n      - Item 3: 1 unit * 5 = 5\n      - Item 4: 0 units * 57 = 0\n      - Item 5: 4 units * 83 = 332\n      - Total value = 50 + 70 + 5 + 0 + 332 = 457\n\n   - **Comparison to outside offer:** 457 is much less than my outside offer of 1193. Therefore, accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1193. The offer must also be realistic (i.e., I can't offer more of an item than Player 1 possesses). I need to consider what I offer Player 1, and therefore what I keep.\n\n3) **Making a Decision**\n\nSince the current offer is worth less than my outside offer, I should not accept it. It is also the first round, so walking away is unlikely to be optimal. Therefore, I should make a counteroffer. My goal is to get as close to the full value as possible while also making the deal palatable to Player 1.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 very little and keeping most of the items.\nI will offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThen I would get:\n6 * 50 + 5 * 70 + 1 * 5 + 2 * 57 + 7 * 83 = 300 + 350 + 5 + 114 + 581 = 1350.\nSince this is larger than 1193, it seems like a good starting point. I will offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   **My outside offer value:** 1193\n*   **Item values:** Item 1: 50, Item 2: 70, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 57, Item 5: 83\n*   **Total items:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 1, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 7\n*   **Discount factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 90% of what it would be worth in round 2, and an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 90% of what it would be worth in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** I am offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 3]. This means I keep:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 1 = 5\n    *   Item 2: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Item 3: 1 - 1 = 0\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   Item 5: 7 - 3 = 4\n    My value for this offer is: (5 * 50) + (4 * 70) + (0 * 5) + (2 * 57) + (4 * 83) = 250 + 280 + 0 + 114 + 332 = 976\n*   **Value of accepting current offer adjusted by discount:** Since this is round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So, the present value of accepting the current offer is 976 * 0.9 = 878.4. This is worse than my outside offer of 1193.\n\n    Now, let's calculate the value of some potential counteroffers.  I need to keep at least 1193 worth of items for my offer to be better than walking away.\n\n    Let's try to give the other player only 1 unit of the most valuable items and see if we are over our outside offer. Let's suppose that I keep [5,4,0,1,6]. The value of this is:\n    (5*50) + (4*70) + (0*5) + (1*57) + (6*83) = 250 + 280 + 0 + 57 + 498 = 1085. This is not above 1193. \n    \n    Let's try offering the other player [0,0,0,0,0]. That means that I keep all of the items. My value would be (6*50) + (5*70) + (1*5) + (2*57) + (7*83) = 300 + 350 + 5 + 114 + 581 = 1350. This is higher than my outside offer of 1193.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   Accepting the current offer is not good since 878.4 < 1193.\n*   Walking away guarantees me 1193.\n*   Offering [0,0,0,0,0] gives me 1350, which is higher than my outside offer.\n*   The other agent is now offering slightly less than before for items 1, 2, and 5. Since the negotiation will end if I counteroffer again, I should counteroffer a take-it-or-leave it offer for the items that will maximize my outcome. \n\nSince this is the final round, if I make a counteroffer, the game ends in a walk. Thus, I should accept if the adjusted value is greater than the walk away.\n\nThe value of accepting the current offer is 976 * 0.9 = 878.4. Walking away provides 1193.\n\nSo, I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 36 x 1 + 65 x 0 + 91 x 3\n    which is 309 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer:** My outside offer value is 310.\n*   **Item Values:** My values for items 1 through 5 are 88, 82, 36, 65, and 91, respectively.\n*   **Total Items:** There are 6 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 5 units of item 5.\n*   **Discount Factor:** The discount factor is 0.9. This means that a deal in round 2 is worth 90% of a deal in round 1, and a deal in round 3 is worth 81% of a deal in round 1.\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** The current offer is [0, 0, 4, 1, 4]. This means I receive:\n    *   6 units of item 1 (6-0 = 6)\n    *   4 units of item 2 (4-0 = 4)\n    *   1 unit of item 3 (5-4 = 1)\n    *   1 unit of item 4 (2-1 = 1)\n    *   1 unit of item 5 (5-4 = 1)\n    The value of this offer to me is: (6 * 88) + (4 * 82) + (1 * 36) + (1 * 65) + (1 * 91) = 528 + 328 + 36 + 65 + 91 = 1048.\n    Since 1048 > 310, accepting the current offer is better than walking away *in this round*.\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that provide me with a value greater than 310.\n    *   The current offer yields 1048. I can explore if there is a better offer that provides me more value.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer is worth 1048 to me, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 310. I want to be greedy but also realize walking away or not getting a deal can result in less value due to the discount factor.\nI'll propose a counteroffer that gives me more of the high-value items, but still leaves Player 1 with a decent amount.\n\nLet's try the counteroffer [2, 1, 3, 1, 2]. This means I receive:\n    * 4 units of item 1 (6 - 2)\n    * 3 units of item 2 (4 - 1)\n    * 2 units of item 3 (5 - 3)\n    * 1 unit of item 4 (2 - 1)\n    * 3 units of item 5 (5 - 2)\n\nThe value of this offer to me is: (4 * 88) + (3 * 82) + (2 * 36) + (1 * 65) + (3 * 91) = 352 + 246 + 72 + 65 + 273 = 1008.\n\nThis offer is a bit lower than the original, however, the discount factor might make my decision to accept a counteroffer worth less in the future. Let me see what happens with a different offer. \n\nHow about counteroffer [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]? This means I receive:\n* 5 units of item 1 (6 - 1)\n* 4 units of item 2 (4 - 0)\n* 3 units of item 3 (5 - 2)\n* 2 units of item 4 (2 - 0)\n* 4 units of item 5 (5 - 1)\n\nThe value of this offer to me is: (5 * 88) + (4 * 82) + (3 * 36) + (2 * 65) + (4 * 91) = 440 + 328 + 108 + 130 + 364 = 1370.\n\nThis is a much better offer for me, so I will propose this.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    88 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 36 x 1 + 65 x 0 + 91 x 3\n    which is 309 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 310. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 4, 1, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 4, 1, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 310\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 88, Item 2: 82, Item 3: 36, Item 4: 65, Item 5: 91\n*   **Total Items:** Item 1: 6, Item 2: 4, Item 3: 5, Item 4: 2, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 times its face value, and an offer accepted this round (round 2) is worth 0.9 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** I am being offered [0, 1, 4, 1, 4]. This means Player 1 gets:\n    *   Item 1: 6 - 0 = 6\n    *   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n    *   Item 3: 5 - 4 = 1\n    *   Item 4: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 4 = 1\n    My value for the current offer is: (0 * 88) + (1 * 82) + (4 * 36) + (1 * 65) + (4 * 91) = 0 + 82 + 144 + 65 + 364 = 655.\n    Considering the discount factor, the present value is 655 * 0.9 = 589.5.\n    This is much greater than my outside offer.\n\n*   **Counteroffers:**  Let's consider a few potential counteroffers, keeping in mind Mistake #1 (making an offer worse than a previous one) and Mistake #2 (making an offer worse than my outside offer). My previous offer was [1, 0, 2, 0, 1].\n\n    To prevent mistakes: calculate the value that I keep, and check if it is higher than the outside offer.\n\n    *   **Counteroffer 1: [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]:**\n        *   Player 1 gets 1 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 1 of item 5.\n        *   I get 5 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\n        *   My value: (5 * 88) + (3 * 82) + (3 * 36) + (1 * 65) + (4 * 91) = 440 + 246 + 108 + 65 + 364 = 1223.\n        *   Discounted value: 1223 * 0.9 = 1100.7, which is much larger than the outside offer.\n    *   **Counteroffer 2: [2, 1, 3, 1, 2]:**\n        *   Player 1 gets 2 of item 1, 1 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n        *   I get 4 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 1 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n        *   My value: (4 * 88) + (3 * 82) + (2 * 36) + (1 * 65) + (3 * 91) = 352 + 246 + 72 + 65 + 273 = 1008.\n        *   Discounted value: 1008 * 0.9 = 907.2, which is much larger than the outside offer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nThe current offer gives me a discounted value of 589.5, which is greater than my outside offer of 310. However, I believe I can get a better deal, as demonstrated by counteroffer 1 and 2 above. Because the current offer of 589.5 is better than my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer, as I don't want to walk away from this great offer.\n\nSince I want to make an offer that improves on the existing situation without being too greedy, I will propose a counteroffer of [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting the same offer in an earlier round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 1, 0, 2]. This means they are giving me 1 unit of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n    *   Value of current offer: (1 * 57) + (2 * 82) + (1 * 88) + (0 * 74) + (2 * 42) = 57 + 164 + 88 + 0 + 84 = 393\n    *   Since 393 is less than my outside offer of 827, accepting the current offer is a Mistake 4.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to consider counteroffers that result in a value greater than 827.\n    *   Since I have to give player 1 my counteroffer, I need to consider how many items I will keep for myself.\n    *   For example, keeping [4, 2, 5, 1, 2] would give me: 4 * 57 + 2 * 82 + 5 * 88 + 1 * 74 + 2 * 42 = 228 + 164 + 440 + 74 + 84 = 990. In this scenario, I would offer player 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This is not a good move, as it is a Mistake 3.\n    *   To improve my offer, I want to offer few item(s) with low value for me. This means, offer more of item 5 (value 42) and item 1 (value 57). Offer less of item 2 (value 82), item 3 (value 88), and item 4 (value 74).\n\n    *   Let's try offering Player 1: [2, 0, 0, 0, 1].\n    I would keep [2, 2, 5, 1, 1].\n    My value is: 2 * 57 + 2 * 82 + 5 * 88 + 1 * 74 + 1 * 42 = 114 + 164 + 440 + 74 + 42 = 834\n    Since 834 > 827, this is a better outcome than walking away. This is also not a Mistake 1 as I don't have a previous offer to compare to.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n*   The current offer is not acceptable.\n*   Walking away is not optimal, since I can make a counteroffer that exceeds my outside offer.\n*   I will propose a counteroffer to player 1.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 827. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1029 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 0, 5, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    57 x 4 + 82 x 0 + 88 x 5 + 74 x 1 + 42 x 2\n    which is 826 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 827. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 0, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n    *   My outside offer value: 827\n    *   My values for items: 57 (item 1), 82 (item 2), 88 (item 3), 74 (item 4), 42 (item 5)\n    *   Total items: 4 (item 1), 2 (item 2), 5 (item 3), 1 (item 4), 2 (item 5)\n    *   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means an offer accepted now is worth more than the same offer accepted next round (value decreases by a factor of 0.9 each round).\n\n2.  **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n    *   **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 1, 0, 2]. This means I would get:\n        *   1 unit of item 1\n        *   1 unit of item 2\n        *   1 unit of item 3\n        *   0 unit of item 4\n        *   2 units of item 5\n        My value for this offer is: (1 \\* 57) + (1 \\* 82) + (1 \\* 88) + (0 \\* 74) + (2 \\* 42) = 57 + 82 + 88 + 0 + 84 = 311\n\n        My values for the items that *I* keep are:\n        *  Items kept: [3, 1, 4, 1, 0]\n        *  Value of items kept = (3 \\* 57) + (1 \\* 82) + (4 \\* 88) + (1 \\* 74) + (0 \\* 42) = 171 + 82 + 352 + 74 + 0 = 679\n        So total value = 311 + 679 = 979\n\n    *   **Comparison to outside offer:** The current offer yields a total value of 311. However, keeping [3, 1, 4, 1, 0] brings me a value of 679. Since the offer on the table is what the *other* agent is offering, and what I am keeping ( [3, 1, 4, 1, 0] ) is important, the value is only 311 to the other party, with my keeping 679.\n        Therefore, accepting this offer implies that I have 1 unit of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 0 unit of item 4, and 2 units of Item 5\n        My total value in that scenario is 57 + 82 + 88 + 0 + 84 = 311. This is less than my outside offer of 827. Thus accepting this offer is mistake 4.\n\n    *   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 827. Let's consider keeping all of items 1, 2, 3, and 4, and giving the two units of item 5 to Player 1.\n        *   Items kept: [4, 2, 5, 1, 0]\n        *   Value = (4 \\* 57) + (2 \\* 82) + (5 \\* 88) + (1 \\* 74) + (0 \\* 42) = 228 + 164 + 440 + 74 + 0 = 906. This is greater than 827.\n\n3.  **Make a decision:**\n\n    *   The current offer is worse than my outside offer (311 < 827), so I should not ACCEPT.\n    *   I should not WALK because I might be able to negotiate a better deal.\n    *   I should make a counteroffer. Giving [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] to Player 1 leaves me with a value of 906, which is greater than my outside offer of 827.\n\nTherefore, my action is to make a counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 0, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 2 + 19 x 1 + 20 x 0 + 87 x 3 + 10 x 4\n    which is 452 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 453. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n\n*   **Outside Offer Value:** 453\n*   **Item Values:** Item 1: 66, Item 2: 19, Item 3: 20, Item 4: 87, Item 5: 10\n*   **Total Items:** Item 1: 5, Item 2: 2, Item 3: 6, Item 4: 3, Item 5: 5\n*   **Discount Factor:** gamma = 0.9. This means that an offer accepted in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value, and an offer accepted in round 3 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]. This means I would receive:\n    *   Item 1: 1 unit\n    *   Item 2: 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 4 units\n\n    My value for accepting this offer would be:\n    (1 * 66) + (1 * 19) + (2 * 20) + (2 * 87) + (4 * 10) = 66 + 19 + 40 + 174 + 40 = 339\n\n    Since 339 < 453 (my outside offer), accepting this offer would be a mistake (Mistake 4).\n\n*   **Potential Counteroffers:** Let's explore a potential counteroffer. My goal is to achieve a value greater than 453. Let's start by trying to keep more of the high-value items and offering more of the lower-value items to Player 1.\n\n    **Counteroffer Idea 1:** Offer Player 1 [3, 1, 4, 1, 3]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 1 = 1 unit\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 4 = 2 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 1 = 2 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n\n    My value would be: (2 * 66) + (1 * 19) + (2 * 20) + (2 * 87) + (2 * 10) = 132 + 19 + 40 + 174 + 20 = 385\n    Still not high enough.\n\n    **Counteroffer Idea 2:** Offer Player 1 [2, 0, 3, 0, 2]. This means I would keep:\n    *   Item 1: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n    *   Item 2: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n    *   Item 3: 6 - 3 = 3 units\n    *   Item 4: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n    *   Item 5: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n\n    My value would be: (3 * 66) + (2 * 19) + (3 * 20) + (3 * 87) + (3 * 10) = 198 + 38 + 60 + 261 + 30 = 587\n\n    This is greater than my outside offer of 453. This seems like a good counteroffer.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I will make a counteroffer that provides me a value greater than my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 0, 3, 0, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 1, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 4 + 92 x 4 + 54 x 1 + 66 x 4 + 2 x 3\n    which is 800 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 801. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 2, 5, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    74 x 3 + 1 x 2 + 25 x 5 + 92 x 0 + 6 x 0\n    which is 349 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 350. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 6, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 6, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide on the best action.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n*   My outside offer value: 350\n*   My values for the items: item 1 = 74, item 2 = 1, item 3 = 25, item 4 = 92, item 5 = 6\n*   Total pool of items: item 1 = 4, item 2 = 2, item 3 = 6, item 4 = 2, item 5 = 2\n*   Discount factor: gamma = 0.9. This means that accepting an offer in a later round is worth less than accepting it now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 2, 6, 1, 0]. This means I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   2 units of item 2\n    *   6 units of item 3\n    *   1 unit of item 4\n    *   0 units of item 5\n    My value for this offer is: (0 * 74) + (2 * 1) + (6 * 25) + (1 * 92) + (0 * 6) = 0 + 2 + 150 + 92 + 0 = 244\n\n*   **Comparison to outside offer:** 244 < 350. Accepting this offer would be worse than taking my outside offer.\n\n3) **Potential counteroffers:** I want to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 350. I need to figure out how many of each item I should keep. Since it's round 1, and I have 3 rounds, there's some time to try and get a good deal.\n\nLet's calculate the total value of all items:\n(4 * 74) + (2 * 1) + (6 * 25) + (2 * 92) + (2 * 6) = 296 + 2 + 150 + 184 + 12 = 644\n\nHere are a few possible counteroffers, calculating what I would *keep* to determine their worth. Then calculating the value of what I keep to compare to the outside offer of 350.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1:** Offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].  I keep [3, 2, 6, 2, 2]. Value: (3 * 74) + (2 * 1) + (6 * 25) + (2 * 92) + (2 * 6) = 222 + 2 + 150 + 184 + 12 = 570 > 350\n*   **Counteroffer 2:** Offer Player 1 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. I keep [4, 2, 6, 1, 2]. Value: (4 * 74) + (2 * 1) + (6 * 25) + (1 * 92) + (2 * 6) = 296 + 2 + 150 + 92 + 12 = 552 > 350\n*   **Counteroffer 3:** Offer Player 1 [1, 0, 2, 1, 1]. I keep [3, 2, 4, 1, 1]. Value: (3 * 74) + (2 * 1) + (4 * 25) + (1 * 92) + (1 * 6) = 222 + 2 + 100 + 92 + 6 = 422 > 350\n\nSince the current offer is worse than my outside offer, and I've found several counteroffers that are better, I will propose a counteroffer. I will choose Counteroffer 3 since it is more balanced, and less aggressive.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI will propose a counteroffer where I give Player 1 [1, 0, 2, 1, 1].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 2, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 277. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1149 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 1 + 98 x 0 + 68 x 1 + 90 x 0 + 81 x 2\n    which is 276 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 277. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means waiting for future rounds reduces the value of any deal by 10% per round.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - Current offer: I am offered [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This means I get 0 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n    - Value of accepting current offer: (0 * 46) + (0 * 98) + (1 * 68) + (1 * 90) + (0 * 81) = 0 + 0 + 68 + 90 + 0 = 158.\n    - 158 is less than my outside offer of 277.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n    - Accepting the current offer (158) is worse than my outside offer (277).\n    - I should not accept.\n    - I need to consider a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 277.\n\nLet's consider some counteroffers. I need to keep enough items to exceed my outside offer value of 277.\n\n*   **Counteroffer 1 (Keep 2 of Item 5):** I keep 2 of item 5 (2 x 81 = 162), and a few more items.

                    "response": "I need to analyze if I should accept the current offer, make a counteroffer, or walk away.\n\nFirst, let me calculate the value of the current offer:\n- I get 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n- I get 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 51 = 153\n- I get 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n- I get 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 32 = 96\n- I get 0 units of item 5: 0 \u00d7 93 = 0\nTotal value of current offer to me: 305\n\nSince this is round 2, there's a discount factor of 0.9 applied, so the actual value is 305 \u00d7 0.9 = 274.5\n\nMy outside offer is 718, which is significantly higher than the value of the current offer, even without discount.\n\nLet me calculate my maximum possible value:\n- All 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n- All 6 units of item 2: 6 \u00d7 51 = 306\n- All 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n- All 6 units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 32 = 192\n- All 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 93 = 186\nTotal max value: 803\n\nSince my outside offer is 718, I need a deal worth at least that much (accounting for the discount factor). With the round 2 discount factor of 0.9, I need a deal worth at least 718/0.9 = 797.8, which is very close to the maximum possible value.\n\nGiven that:\n1. The current offer (274.5) is much lower than my outside option (718)\n2. We're already in round 2, so more negotiations would incur further discounts\n3. I need to keep the highly valuable item 5 (worth 93 per unit)\n\nI'll make one final counteroffer, keeping most of the high-value items for myself while giving items with lower value to Player 2.\n\nMy counteroffer:\n- Give 2 units of item 1 (keeping 2): I value at 28 per unit\n- Give 3 units of item 2 (keeping 3): I value at 51 per unit\n- Give 1 unit of item 3 (keeping 0): I value at 7 per unit\n- Give 3 units of item 4 (keeping 3): I value at 32 per unit\n- Give 0 units of item 5 (keeping 2): I value at 93 per unit\n\nThis gives me: (2\u00d728) + (3\u00d751) + (0\u00d77) + (3\u00d732) + (2\u00d793) = 56 + 153 + 0 + 96 + 186 = 491\nWith the round 2 discount: 491 \u00d7 0.9 = 441.9\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer (718), so I should actually walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 1, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 0 + 4 x 6 + 89 x 1 + 31 x 4 + 48 x 0\n    which is 237 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 238. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 238. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 1, 4, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 0 + 4 x 6 + 89 x 1 + 31 x 4 + 48 x 0\n    which is 237 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 238. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 0, 3, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This means offers in later rounds are worth less.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n*   **Current offer:** Player 1 offers me [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]. This means I get:\n    *   0 units of item 1\n    *   1 unit of item 2\n    *   0 units of item 3\n    *   2 units of item 4\n    *   1 unit of item 5\n    My value from this offer: (0 * 40) + (1 * 4) + (0 * 89) + (2 * 31) + (1 * 48) = 0 + 4 + 0 + 62 + 48 = 114\n    Comparing this to my outside offer of 238, it is much worse.\n*   **Potential counteroffers:** I need to keep at least enough items to exceed my outside offer of 238. Let's consider a counteroffer where I give Player 1 only what they offered in round 1.\n    Their Round 1 offer to me: [1, 2, 0, 3, 1]. This means I would keep:\n    * item 1: 8 - 1 = 7 units\n    * item 2: 9 - 2 = 7 units\n    * item 3: 1 - 0 = 1 unit\n    * item 4: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n    * item 5: 1 - 1 = 0 units\n\n    My value for this: (7 * 40) + (7 * 4) + (1 * 89) + (1 * 31) + (0 * 48) = 280 + 28 + 89 + 31 + 0 = 428. I would then offer [1, 2, 0, 3, 1] to Player 1.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\nThe current offer is significantly worse than my outside offer, so I should not accept.\n\nLet's create a counteroffer that is better than my outside option. Offering [1, 2, 0, 3, 1] to player 1 gives me a value of 428, which is better than my outside offer.\n\nTherefore, I will make this counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 0, 3, 1]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    80 x 0 + 86 x 0 + 17 x 1 + 66 x 0 + 72 x 1\n    which is 89 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 90. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Let's try offering [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]. In this case, I will have:\n*   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1\n*   Item 2: 4 - 1 = 3\n*   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n*   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n*   Item 5: 4 - 1 = 3\nMy value for this would be: (1 * 80) + (3 * 86) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 66) + (3 * 72) = 80 + 258 + 34 + 132 + 216 = 720, This value is better than 551.\nI'm going to test one additional possibility of a better offer, offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]. In this case, I will have:\n*   Item 1: 1 - 0 = 1\n*   Item 2: 4 - 0 = 4\n*   Item 3: 2 - 0 = 2\n*   Item 4: 2 - 0 = 2\n*   Item 5: 4 - 2 = 2\nMy value for this would be: (1 * 80) + (4 * 86) + (2 * 17) + (2 * 66) + (2 * 72) = 80 + 344 + 34 + 132 + 144 = 734.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation step by step to determine the best action in this negotiation.\n\n1. **Analyze the current situation:**\n\n   - My outside offer value is 598.\n   - My values for items 1-5 are 27, 27, 31, 95, and 12, respectively.\n   - The total available items are 5 of item 1, 8 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 4 of item 4, and 3 of item 5.\n   - The discount factor is 0.9. This means that getting a deal now is worth more than getting a similar deal in a later round.\n\n2. **Assess the value of offers:**\n\n   - **Current offer:** Player 1 is offering me [1, 2, 0, 3, 3]. This means I would receive:\n      - 1 unit of item 1\n      - 2 units of item 2\n      - 0 units of item 3\n      - 3 units of item 4\n      - 3 units of item 5\n\n      My value for this offer is: (1 * 27) + (2 * 27) + (0 * 31) + (3 * 95) + (3 * 12) = 27 + 54 + 0 + 285 + 36 = 402.\n\n      Since 402 < 598 (my outside offer), accepting this offer would be a Mistake 4.\n\n   - **Potential counteroffers:** I need to find a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer. I can calculate my value based on what *I keep*, rather than what I offer. Let's explore some options. Since item 4 is very valuable to me, I want to keep as much of it as possible.\n\n   -Option 1: Give away all items except item 4. This is offering all items of type 1,2,3, and 5. My value would be 4*95 = 380, which is less than my outside offer value of 598.\n\n   -Option 2: I keep all items except item 1 and offer it all to Player 1.\n       My value is (8 * 27) + (4 * 31) + (4 * 95) + (3 * 12) = 216 + 124 + 380 + 36 = 756\n\n   -Option 3: Give Player 1 2 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 0 units of item 5. This would mean I keep 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4 and 3 units of item 5.\n       My value is (3 * 27) + (4 * 27) + (4 * 31) + (4 * 95) + (3 * 12) = 81 + 108 + 124 + 380 + 36 = 729\n       The counteroffer is [2, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n3. **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n\n   - Accepting the current offer (402) is worse than my outside offer (598).\n   - Walking away gives me 598.\n   - Option 2 gives Player 1 [5, 8, 4, 4, 3]. I get 756\n   - Option 3 gives Player 1 [2, 4, 0, 0, 0]. I get 729\n\n   Since 756 is the highest, I'm going with Option 2.\n   The counteroffer is [5, 8, 4, 4, 3]\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 8, 4, 4, 3]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    47 x 0 + 45 x 0 + 95 x 0 + 98 x 0 + 51 x 1\n    which is 51 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 61. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This is unusual and suggests they either have very low values for the items or are using an extreme negotiation tactic.\n\nAt this point, accepting their offer would give me everything, which is better than my outside option (774 > 475). However, I should try one more counteroffer to see if there's a middle ground that's still advantageous to me.\n\nLet me try a slightly more generous offer than my first one, focusing on giving Player 2 items that have lower value to me:\n\nNew counteroffer: [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]\nThis means I would keep:\n- 4 of item 1 (value: 4\u00d753 = 212)\n- 1 of item 2 (value: 1\u00d726 = 26)\n- 3 of item 3 (value: 3\u00d753 = 159)\n- 1 of item 4 (value: 1\u00d723 = 23)\n- 2 of item 5 (value: 2\u00d740 = 80)\nTotal value to me: 500 \u00d7 0.9 = 450 (with discount)\n\nSince this is less than my outside offer of 475, I should adjust my offer to keep more value. \n\nLet me revise to: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\nThis means I would keep:\n- 5 of item 1 (value: 5\u00d753 = 265)\n- 2 of item 2 (value: 2\u00d726 = 52)\n- 3 of item 3 (value: 3\u00d753 = 159)\n- 2 of item 4 (value: 2\u00d723 = 46)\n- 3 of item 5 (value: 3\u00d740 = 120)\nTotal value to me: 642 \u00d7 0.9 = 577.8 (with discount)\n\nThis is better than my outside offer (577.8 > 475).\n\nHowever, given that Player 2 has offered me everything, the most rational action is to accept their offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 2, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 0 + 95 x 0 + 49 x 1 + 36 x 2 + 78 x 0\n    which is 121 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 127. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 3, 3, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 3, 3, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 528. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1107 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 0, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 2 + 93 x 2 + 53 x 0 + 91 x 0 + 76 x 3\n    which is 526 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 528. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 0, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

This means that an offer accepted in a later round is worth less than the same offer accepted now.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current Offer:** Player 1 is offering me [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]. This means I would get:\n      - Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n      - Item 2: 5 - 2 = 3 units\n      - Item 3: 5 - 4 = 1 unit\n      - Item 4: 5 - 1 = 4 units\n      - Item 5: 4 - 3 = 1 unit\n      My value for this offer would be: (2 * 60) + (3 * 18) + (1 * 63) + (4 * 93) + (1 * 52) = 120 + 54 + 63 + 372 + 52 = 661.\n      Since 661 is less than my outside offer of 930, accepting this offer would be Mistake 4.\n\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to create a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 930.\n\nLet's start by trying to keep a large portion of item 4, since it has the highest value for me.\n\nCounteroffer 1: I keep 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 4 of item 4, 2 of item 5. This means I offer player 1 [0, 2, 2, 1, 2].\nValue to me = (2 * 60) + (3 * 18) + (3 * 63) + (4 * 93) + (2 * 52) = 120 + 54 + 189 + 372 + 104 = 839. This is not high enough.\n\nCounteroffer 2: I keep 2 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 4 of item 3, 5 of item 4, 3 of item 5. This means I offer player 1 [0, 1, 1, 0, 1].\nValue to me = (2 * 60) + (4 * 18) + (4 * 63) + (5 * 93) + (3 * 52) = 120 + 72 + 252 + 465 + 156 = 1065. This is good.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - The current offer is worse than my outside offer, so I will not accept it.\n   - Counteroffer 2 gives me a value of 1065, which is greater than my outside offer of 930.\n\nTherefore, I will make counteroffer 2.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 1, 5, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 2 + 18 x 1 + 63 x 5 + 93 x 4 + 52 x 2\n    which is 929 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 930. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This means that any deal in round 2 is worth 0.9 times its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of the current offer:**\n\nThe current offer gives me: [0, 2, 3, 0, 2]\n\nThis means Player 1 gets [2-0, 5-2, 5-3, 5-0, 4-2] = [2, 3, 2, 5, 2]\n\nWhich leaves me with: [0, 2, 3, 0, 2] units of each item.\n\nMy value for the current offer is: (0 * 60) + (2 * 18) + (3 * 63) + (0 * 93) + (2 * 52) = 0 + 36 + 189 + 0 + 104 = 329.\nConsidering the discount factor, the present value of accepting this offer is 329 * 0.9 = 296.1\n\n3) **Compare to the outside offer and consider counteroffers:**\n\nSince 296.1 is less than my outside offer of 930, accepting the current offer is a mistake (Mistake 4). I should not accept.\n\nLet's consider some potential counteroffers. I need to make an offer that leaves me with a value greater than 930/0.9 = 1033.33 to be worthwhile.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I get all of item 4 (worth 5 * 93 = 465), all of item 3 (worth 5 * 63 = 315), and all of item 1 (worth 2 * 60 = 120). That is 465 + 315 + 120 = 900. I still need 133.33, so I need more of the other items.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 0 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 2 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\nThis leaves me with 2 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\nMy value is: (2 * 60) + (2 * 18) + (3 * 63) + (5 * 93) + (4 * 52) = 120 + 36 + 189 + 465 + 208 = 1018\nWith the discount factor, the value is 1018*0.9 = 916.2. Still below my outside offer.\n\nLet's try offering Player 1 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 0 of item 4, and 0 of item 5.\nThis leaves me with 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 5 of item 4, and 4 of item 5.\nMy value is: (2 * 60) + (3 * 18) + (5 * 63) + (5 * 93) + (4 * 52) = 120 + 54 + 315 + 465 + 208 = 1162\nWith the discount factor, the value is 1162*0.9 = 1045.8.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    92 x 0 + 21 x 3 + 85 x 1 + 37 x 1 + 61 x 2\n    which is 307 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 308. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 3, 1, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means Player 1 receives [2, 1, 2, 0, 5].\n      - My value for the current offer: (3 * 33) + (0 * 72) + (1 * 36) + (3 * 80) + (1 * 59) = 99 + 0 + 36 + 240 + 59 = 434\n      - Since 434 > 316 (my outside offer), accepting this offer is better than walking away *immediately*.\n\n3) **Consider a counteroffer:**\n\nLet's evaluate some potential counteroffers to see if we can get something even better than 434, taking the discount factor into account. I am trying to maximize my outcome, but I will only have 2 more turns.\n\nLet's evaluate my value of keeping everything for myself:\n(5 * 33) + (1 * 72) + (3 * 36) + (3 * 80) + (6 * 59) = 165 + 72 + 108 + 240 + 354 = 939\nIf I make a counteroffer that gives Player 1 nothing. I will make 939, and Player 1 will likely walk.\nIf Player 1 offers me 434, then they get 939-434 = 505.\nDiscounted future offer = 939 * 0.9 = 845.1\n\nThe current offer is good, let's examine some counteroffers, starting by keeping just a little bit for myself:\nIf I keep [2, 1, 2, 0, 5]: (2 * 33) + (1 * 72) + (2 * 36) + (0 * 80) + (5 * 59) = 66 + 72 + 72 + 0 + 295 = 505\nIf I keep [3, 1, 1, 1, 4]: (3 * 33) + (1 * 72) + (1 * 36) + (1 * 80) + (4 * 59) = 99 + 72 + 36 + 80 + 236 = 523\nIf I keep [4, 1, 2, 2, 5]: (4 * 33) + (1 * 72) + (2 * 36) + (2 * 80) + (5 * 59) = 132 + 72 + 72 + 160 + 295 = 731\n\nThe current offer gives me 434. If I were to counteroffer, say I'd give them [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], meaning I keep [3, 1, 3, 3, 6] then my value is\n(3 * 33) + (1 * 72) + (3 * 36) + (3 * 80) + (6 * 59) = 99 + 72 + 108 + 240 + 354 = 873.\n\nI should ACCEPT the current offer of [3, 0, 1, 3, 1] since the value is 434 > 316.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1331. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 4, 6, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 8 + 34 x 4 + 17 x 6 + 95 x 4 + 88 x 5\n    which is 1330 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1331. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [9, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [9, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

This means any deal in round 2 is worth 90% of its face value, and in round 3 it is worth 81% of its face value.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: I am being offered [9, 0, 0, 2, 0]. This means Player 1 is offering me all 9 of item 1, 0 of item 2, 0 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 0 of item 5. My value if I accept this offer is: (9 * 34) + (0 * 34) + (0 * 17) + (2 * 95) + (0 * 88) = 306 + 0 + 0 + 190 + 0 = 496.\n\n   - Comparison to outside offer: 496 is significantly less than my outside offer of 1331.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Accepting the current offer is a bad idea (Mistake 4).\n   - Walking away might be premature, as it's only round 1.\n   - I should propose a counteroffer.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping all the items for myself: (9 * 34) + (4 * 34) + (7 * 17) + (5 * 95) + (5 * 88) = 306 + 136 + 119 + 475 + 440 = 1476.\n\nI need to offer Player 1 something to make it worthwhile for them to negotiate.

This gives me a value of 475 + 440 = 915.\n\nHow about I offer [6, 2, 4, 0, 0]? This gives me [3, 2, 3, 5, 5].\nMy value is (3 * 34) + (2 * 34) + (3 * 17) + (5 * 95) + (5 * 88) = 102 + 68 + 51 + 475 + 440 = 1136.\n\nHow about I offer [6, 2, 0, 0, 0]?

Since my outside offer is so good (1679 out of a possible 1798), I should make an offer that gives me most of the high-value items.\n\nLet's structure a counteroffer:\n- I'll keep all of items 3 and 5 (my highest values at 98 and 99)\n- I'll keep all of item 2 (my next highest at 93)\n- I'll keep most of item 4 (40 value)\n- I'll offer all of item 1 (my lowest value at 5)\n\nMy counteroffer to Player 2 would be [9, 0, 0, 2, 0], which means I give them:\n- All 9 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 0 units of item 3\n- 2 units of item 4\n- 0 units of item 5\n\nThis is actually the same as my initial offer. Player 2 didn't accept it, which suggests they value other items more. However, given my very high outside offer, I should stick close to my original position.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [9, 0, 0, 2, 0]}",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 9 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 34 for item 1, 34 for item 2, 17 for item 3, 95 for item 4, 88 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1476. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1331. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1331. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 804 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [8, 4, 6, 4, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 8 + 34 x 4 + 17 x 6 + 95 x 4 + 88 x 5\n    which is 1330 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1331. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [9, 0, 0, 2, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [6, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [9, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [9, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1) **Current Situation:**\n    - My outside offer value: 1331\n    - Item values: item 1: 34, item 2: 34, item 3: 17, item 4: 95, item 5: 88\n    - Total items: item 1: 9, item 2: 4, item 3: 7, item 4: 5, item 5: 5\n    - Discount factor: 0.9.  Since it's round 2, the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n    - Current offer: Player 1 offers me [9, 0, 0, 2, 0]. This means I get 9 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5. My value is:\n        9 * 34 + 0 * 34 + 0 * 17 + 2 * 95 + 0 * 88 = 306 + 190 = 496.\n        Considering the discount factor, the value is 496 * 0.9 = 446.4.\n    - Since 446.4 < 1331 (my outside offer), accepting this offer would be a mistake.\n\n3) **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 1331. Let's aim for a counteroffer where I keep at least half of the items, while also offering some items to player 1 to make it acceptable.\n\nLet's consider keeping [4, 2, 4, 3, 3] for myself, and offering the remainder to Player 1. That means I offer Player 1 [5, 2, 3, 2, 2]. My value is:\n4 * 34 + 2 * 34 + 4 * 17 + 3 * 95 + 3 * 88 = 136 + 68 + 68 + 285 + 264 = 821.\n\nThis is still not enough.\n\nLet's try offering [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. I would then keep all the items. My value would be:\n9 * 34 + 4 * 34 + 7 * 17 + 5 * 95 + 5 * 88 = 306 + 136 + 119 + 475 + 440 = 1476.\nDiscounted value = 1476 * 0.9 = 1328.4\n\nThat is still not good enough as 1328.4 < 1331.\n\nLet's try giving away only one unit of item 1, so I offer [1, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nI keep [8, 4, 7, 5, 5]. My value is:\n8 * 34 + 4 * 34 + 7 * 17 + 5 * 95 + 5 * 88 = 272 + 136 + 119 + 475 + 440 = 1442\nDiscounted value = 1442 * 0.9 = 1297.8\nThat is even worse!\n\nI'm in round 2 and if I make a counteroffer that will be treated as a WALK in round 3. If I WALK now I get 1331. Let's go back to my first calculation where I keep all the items for myself and offer [0,0,0,0,0] which gives me discounted value = 1328.4. Since 1328.4 < 1331, this is worse than walking away.\n\nSince the current offer is [9,0,0,2,0], accepting would yield me a discounted value of 446.4, which is worse than my outside offer 1331.\n\nTherefore, I should WALK.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
