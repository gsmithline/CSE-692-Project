Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 326. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 326. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1083 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Retaining 3 out of 4 units gives me 297.\n   - I value item 2 highly too (89 per unit). Retaining 4 out of 6 units gives me 356.\n   - I'll keep 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 3, and 1 unit of item 4.\n     - 1 unit of item 1 gives me 79.\n     - 1 unit of item 3 gives me 39.\n     - 1 unit of item 4 gives me 55.\n   - This counteroffer proposal will be:\n     - Items to Player 2: [1 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 1 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 1 of item 5]\n   - Value to me: \n     - Player 1\u2019s retained: 1 item 1 (79) + 4 item 2 (356) + 1 item 3 (39) + 1 item 4 (55) + 3 item 5 (297)\n     - Total = 79 + 356 + 39 + 55 + 297 = 826\n   - 826 is much higher than my outside offer of 326, ensuring beyond a significant margin in value.\n\nHence, I shall propose this as my initial offer.

If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    25 x 0 + 89 x 0 + 4 x 3 + 83 x 0 + 26 x 4\n    which is 116 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 117. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    72 x 1 + 35 x 0 + 62 x 0 + 30 x 1 + 27 x 0\n    which is 102 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 103. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

Therefore:\n   - Accepting this offer won't commit mistake 4 (accepting an offer worse than my outside offer).\n\n3) Decision Making:\n   - Since the current offer (value 127) is better than my outside offer (value 103), accepting this offer is beneficial for me.\n   - Rejecting the offer and not having a better counteroffer ready could risk Mistake 5, walking away from a good offer.\n\nGiven this analysis, the decision is clear:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 119. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 47 = 141 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 94 = 282 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 918 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 2, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 2, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

We are in round 2, so if we go to round 3, the value will be multiplied by gamma^1 = 0.9.\n\n2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n   - Current offer [0, 1, 1, 2, 4] to me means:\n     - Item 1: 0 units, value = 0 * 47 = 0\n     - Item 2: 3 units, value = 3 * 94 = 282 (I get 3 units because the total is 4)\n     - Item 3: 1 unit, value = 1 * 94 = 94\n     - Item 4: 1 unit, value = 1 * 21 = 21 (I get 1 unit because the total is 3)\n     - Item 5: 0 units, value = 0 * 50 = 0\n     - Total value to me = 282 + 94 + 21 = 397\n     - Present value in round 2 = 397 * 0.9 = 357.3\n\n3) Compare to My Outside Offer:\n   - My present value from accepting the current offer (357.3) is much higher than my outside offer (119).\n\nBased on the analysis, accepting the current offer gives me significantly more value than my outside option. Walking away or proposing a counteroffer may risk losing this advantageous deal, especially as the discount factor will further reduce future values.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 1 + 13 x 3 + 97 x 3 + 10 x 2 + 5 x 2\n    which is 456 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 457. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Here is a potential counteroffer proposal:\n     - I keep 6 units of item 1, giving 3 to Player 2\n     - I take all 4 units of item 2, giving 0 to Player 2\n     - I take 1 unit of item 3, giving 4 to Player 2\n     - I take 4 units of item 4, giving 1 to Player 2\n     - I take 2 units of item 5, giving 5 to Player 2\n\n   **My Value Calculation for Proposed Counteroffer:**\n   - Value for Item 1: 6 units x 43 = 258\n   - Value for Item 2: 4 units x 40 = 160\n   - Value for Item 3: 1 unit x 4 = 4\n   - Value for Item 4: 4 units x 93 = 372\n   - Value for Item 5: 2 units x 16 = 32\n   - **Total Value to Me** = 826\n\n   This offer gives me a total value of 826, which is significantly above my outside offer of 279.\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I should make a counteroffer that ensures my total value is above 279. My chosen counteroffer is beneficial to me and complies with my constraints as it gives me a total value of 826, which is much greater than my outside offer.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 0, 4, 1, 5]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    73 x 0 + 19 x 0 + 70 x 2 + 77 x 5 + 96 x 2\n    which is 717 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 718. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to ensure any offer I make does not reduce my retained value below 756.\n   - To maximize my value and make a reasonable counteroffer, I should try to keep the higher-valued items. Here's an option:\n     - Offer Player 2:\n       - 2 units of item 1 (value to me: 2 * 97 = 194)\n       - 2 units of item 2 (value to me: 2 * 73 = 146)\n       - 1 unit of item 3 (value to me: 1 * 89 = 89)\n       - 1 unit of item 5 (value to me: 1 * 10 = 10)\n\n   - **Total Value Retained if I Offer the Above:**\n     - Retained units: \n       - 5 units of item 1: 5 * 97 = 485\n       - 3 units of item 2: 3 * 73 = 219\n       - 2 units of item 3: 2 * 89 = 178\n       - 2 units of item 4: 2 * 77 = 154\n       - 2 units of item 5: 2 * 10 = 20\n     - Total Value Retained: 485 + 219 + 178 + 154 + 20 = 1056\n\nSince 1056 is greater than my outside offer of 756, this offer is a valid counteroffer that maximizes my value.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI'm going to propose this counteroffer:\n- {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 1, 0, 1]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 275. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 621 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 2, 5] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    66 x 0 + 81 x 0 + 24 x 5 + 9 x 2 + 27 x 5\n    which is 273 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 275. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "To determine the appropriate action in this negotiation, I'll walk through the steps outlined:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** My outside offer is 375.\n   - **Values of the items involved:** \n     - Item 1: 26\n     - Item 2: 16\n     - Item 3: 84\n     - Item 4: 22\n     - Item 5: 12\n   - **Total pool of items:** \n     - 9 units of item 1\n     - 4 units of item 2\n     - 4 units of item 3\n     - 1 unit of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - **Discount factor influence:** Since this is round 1, the discount factor effect is gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^0 = 1, so there is no discount applied yet. However, in future rounds, my value from offers will be reduced, which places additional importance on making a strong initial offer.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - **Current offer value:** There is no current offer on the table.\n   - **Potential counteroffers:**\n     - My total value of all items if I keep all:\n       - 9 units of item 1: 9 \u00d7 26 = 234\n       - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 16 = 64\n       - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 84 = 336\n       - 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n       - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n       - Total = 234 + 64 + 336 + 22 + 36 = 692\n     - Any offer must yield me more than my outside offer of 375. Therefore, I need to keep items worth more than 375. \n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I should try to ensure I retain at least 375 in value. One such strategy can be to prioritize keeping high-value items or a mix that ensures my total is over 375.\n   - Possible divisions ensuring value > 375: I could keep all of item 3 and negotiate on the others while ensuring I total over 375 in value.\n\n**Drafting my initial offer:**  \n- Attempt to maximize my retained value while making an attractive offer to Player 2.\n\nAssuming Player 2 might value item 5 due to their likely valuation, I can propose:\n- Give 1 unit of item 1\n- Give 3 units of item 2\n- Give 0 units of item 3\n- Give 0 units of item 4\n- Give 1 unit of item 5\n\nRetaining:\n- 8 units of item 1: 8 \u00d7 26 = 208\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 84 = 336 (keep full of item 3)\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n\nTotal = 208 + 16 + 336 + 22 + 24 = 606\n\nThis offer gives me a value of 606, well above my outside offer value of 375.\n\nTherefore, my action is:   \n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 3, 0, 0, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 0, 3, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 7 + 47 x 0 + 22 x 3 + 75 x 1 + 31 x 2\n    which is 637 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 638. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 0, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [7, 0, 3, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 7 + 47 x 0 + 22 x 3 + 75 x 1 + 31 x 2\n    which is 637 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 638. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 2, 3, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 2, 3, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To evaluate the current offer and decide on the next action, let's follow the outlined steps:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 638.\n   - My values per unit item are: item 1: 62, item 2: 47, item 3: 22, item 4: 75, item 5: 31.\n   - The total pool of items is: 9 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, and 3 units of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) affects the value if we go into the next round. In this round, the value is not yet discounted since gamma is raised to the power of (r-1) where r=2, meaning gamma^1 = 0.9. So, any future values need to be multiplied by 0.9 if moving to the next round.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer [3, 2, 3, 0, 1] to me means I get:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 47 = 94\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 22 = 66\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 75 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n     - Total value = 186 + 94 + 66 + 0 + 31 = 377\n   \n   Comparing 377 with my outside offer value of 638, the current offer is worse for me. Accepting it doesn't make sense unless future negotiation rounds increase the offer's effective value beyond 638, which isn't possible with a discount factor involved.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I should not accept the current offer because its value is lower than my outside offer.\n   - Walking away secures my outside offer of 638, which is better than the current proposal valued at 377.\n   - I should not propose a counteroffer unless it clearly exceeds my outside offer. \n\nTherefore, the best strategic action is to:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 304. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 876 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To make a decision, I'll follow the step-by-step analysis provided.\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 304.\n   - My values for each item are:\n     - Item 1: 82\n     - Item 2: 24\n     - Item 3: 64\n     - Item 4: 31\n     - Item 5: 91\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 2 of item 1\n     - 2 of item 2\n     - 3 of item 3\n     - 8 of item 4\n     - 4 of item 5\n   - Total maximum value of all items to me: \n     \\[ (2 \\times 82) + (2 \\times 24) + (3 \\times 64) + (8 \\times 31) + (4 \\times 91) = 1016 \\]\n\n   - Discount factor: If the negotiation extends to further rounds, the value I get will be multiplied by \\(\\gamma^{r-1}\\) where \\(r\\) is the round number. Since \\(\\gamma = 0.9\\), delaying negotiations reduces the effective value of items.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There's currently no offer to me. \n   - I need to make an initial offer.\n   - Any offer I make should be better than my outside offer value of 304, otherwise it's mistake #2 (worse than my outside offer).\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I must propose a counteroffer that is better for me than my outside offer and ensure that the items I keep provide more than my outside offer's value.\n\n   Calculate potential values for myself keeping specific items:\n   - A starting offer could be giving Player 2 minimal items that add up to slightly less than the total I can afford to give away while retaining at least 305 in value for myself. \n\nLet's propose a counteroffer where I maximize my value significantly over my outside offer. To begin, I'll try keeping the most valuable items with high quantities.\n\n- Example counteroffer concept: I give away the least impactful items from my perspective:\n  * Give away:\n    - 0 units of item 1\n    - 2 units of item 2\n    - 1 unit of item 3\n    - 4 units of item 4\n    - 2 units of item 5\n\n  This would mean keeping:\n  - 2 of item 1: \\(2 \\times 82 = 164\\)\n  - 0 of item 2: \\(0 \\times 24 = 0\\)\n  - 2 of item 3: \\(2 \\times 64 = 128\\)\n  - 4 of item 4: \\(4 \\times 31 = 124\\)\n  - 2 of item 5: \\(2 \\times 91 = 182\\)\n\n  Total value to me from this offer: \\(164 + 0 + 128 + 124 + 182 = 586\\)\n\nThis is substantially more than the outside offer of 304. \n\nThus, I propose the following counteroffer:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 1, 4, 2]}\n```",

Your value would be:\n    79 x 1 + 67 x 0 + 98 x 1 + 88 x 7 + 27 x 0\n    which is 793 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 794. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 794. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1077 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 7, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    79 x 1 + 67 x 0 + 98 x 1 + 88 x 7 + 27 x 0\n    which is 793 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 794. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since it is round 1, the discount factor does not affect this round as \\( \\gamma^{r-1} = \\gamma^0 = 1 \\).\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - There is no current offer to evaluate.\n   - For potential counteroffers: I will propose a division that ensures my total value is greater than my outside offer value of 584.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Given we're in round 2, any value I achieve now will be multiplied by \\(0.9^{1} = 0.9\\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer [2, 2, 2, 1, 3]**:\n  - Item 1: 68 \u00d7 2 = 136\n  - Item 2: 66 \u00d7 2 = 132\n  - Item 3: 18 \u00d7 2 = 36\n  - Item 4: 57 \u00d7 1 = 57\n  - Item 5: 84 \u00d7 3 = 252\n  - Total Value: 136 + 132 + 36 + 57 + 252 = 613\n  - Adjusted Value in Round 2: 613 \u00d7 0.9 = 551.7\n\nThe current offer's adjusted value to me is 551.7, which is less than my outside offer value of 927.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer**:\n  - I'll aim to propose a division where my total value exceeds my outside offer of 927.\n  - Consider keeping more of the valuable items and offer a counter where the total value exceeds 927.\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\nThe current offer is far below my outside offer.

Since it's round 3, any value calculation I make by accepting or counteroffering will be multiplied by gamma raised to the power of (3-1) = 0.9^2 = 0.81.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current Offer:** \n  - I am being offered [3, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n  - Value calculation for accepting:\n    - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n    - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 39 = 78\n    - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 76 = 152\n    - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 81 = 81\n    - Item 5: 2 \u00d7 59 = 118\n    - Total without discount: 603\n    - Total with discount: 603 \u00d7 0.81 = 488.43\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer:** \n  - My outside offer value = 1459\n  - Applying the discount factor on my outside offer value: 1459 \u00d7 0.81 = 1181.79\n  - Current offer value (488.43) is substantially lower than my discounted outside offer value (1181.79).\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- **Should I Accept?** \n  - No, because the current offer is significantly worse than my discounted outside offer value.\n  \n- **Should I Walk?**\n  - Yes, because my outside offer value (1181.79 discounted) is greater than any potential value from the negotiation thus far.\n\n- **Should I Make a Counteroffer?**\n  - Given this is the final round and there is no subsequent opportunity for negotiation, any counteroffer must substantially exceed the value of my outside offer, which seems unlikely given the circumstances and prior offers.\n\nIn conclusion, the best course of action is to walk away, as accepting or counteroffering would not surpass the value of my outside offer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

In this round, since it's the first one, the discount factor for my calculation will be \\(0.9^{0}\\) = 1. However, in subsequent rounds, accepting deals will decrease the value due to the discounting effect.\n\nNext, assess the value I could achieve from potential offers:\n\n1) **If I keep all items:**\n   - Value = (6 \\* 91) + (2 \\* 8) + (2 \\* 94) + (5 \\* 93) + (4 \\* 42) = 546 + 16 + 188 + 465 + 168 = 1383\n\n2) **If I offer Player 2:**\n   - I should formulate a counteroffer ensuring the value to me is equal to or greater than my outside offer value (529). To achieve this, let's consider keeping the majority of high-value items:\n\n3) **Formulate a Counteroffer:**\n   - Offer Player 2 low-value items and partial high-value items but keep most units to maintain a high value for myself.\n   - Let's propose giving away fewer high-value items.\n\n   Here's one example calculation:\n   - Keep: 4 of Item 1 (364), 0 of Item 2 (0), 1 of Item 3 (94), 3 of Item 4 (279), 2 of Item 5 (84).\n   - Offer Player 2: 2 of Item 1, 2 of Item 2, 1 of Item 3, 2 of Item 4, 2 of Item 5.\n   - Self Value = 364 + 0 + 94 + 279 + 84 = 821\n\n4) **Decision:**\n   - The potential value of 821 is higher than my outside offer (529).

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 2, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    24 x 4 + 13 x 2 + 75 x 2 + 71 x 4 + 20 x 2\n    which is 596 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 597. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Let's look at a scenario:\n   \n   Retaining [3, 0, 2, 3, 3] items (offering [3, 2, 0, 2, 1] to Player 1):\n   - My value:\n     - Item 1: 3 x 24 = 72\n     - Item 2: 0 x 13 = 0\n     - Item 3: 2 x 75 = 150\n     - Item 4: 3 x 71 = 213\n     - Item 5: 3 x 20 = 60\n   - Total value = 72 + 0 + 150 + 213 + 60 = 495\n\n   This retains total value as being less than 597, unless further adjustment is made.\n\n   Adjusting further:\n   Trying to retain [4, 0, 2, 4, 2] (offering [2, 2, 0, 1, 2] to Player 1):\n   - My new value:\n     - Item 1: 4 x 24 = 96\n     - Item 2: 0 x 13 = 0\n     - Item 3: 2 x 75 = 150\n     - Item 4: 4 x 71 = 284\n     - Item 5: 2 x 20 = 40\n   - Total value = 96 + 0 + 150 + 284 + 40 = 570\n\n  This is getting closer and better when discounted by the gamma factor \\(0.9\\). It needs another fine-tuning. \n  \n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven my detailed calculations, none of the current feasible counteroffers immediately surpass 597 when considering the rules of mistake 2. Hence, it makes more sense in strategy to walk away than accept something worse than my outside offer.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nGiven the constraints, and since no optimal profitable counteroffers materializes, the best response left given the round execution is:\n \n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 3, 0, 2, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    46 x 3 + 62 x 3 + 45 x 0 + 60 x 2 + 90 x 6\n    which is 984 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 985. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

This is better than the current negotiation outcome (348).\n   - **Counteroffer:** I need a counteroffer that gives me more than 985 in value.\n\nUnderstand the offer counter logic:\n  \n  To get a value greater than 985, calculate by reallocating items:\n   \n   Let's propose a balanced offer that is just slightly over my outside offer:\n   \n   Try to maximize as follows (still an example):\n\n   - Keeping 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5.\n   - Offer Player 1: \n\n     - 1 unit of item 1\n     - 1 unit of item 2\n     - 0 unit of item 3\n     - 2 unit of item 4\n     - 2 unit of item 5\n   \n   Check my value:\n   - 3 x 46 + 2 x 62 + 0 x 45 + 2 x 60 + 5 x 90 = 138 + 124 + 0 + 120 + 450 = 832\n   \n   This counteroffer provides a value of 832, which is still less than my outside offer, therefore needs more balancing. Here is a final attempt:\n\n   - Propose:\n     - Accept 1 unit of item 1\n     - Accept 1 unit of item 2\n     - Accept 0 unit of item 3\n     - Accept 1 unit of item 4\n     - Accept 4 to me for item 5\n   \n   My evaluation: \n   - 3 x 46 + 2 x 62 + 0 x 45 + 2 x 60 + 3 x 90 = 138 + 124 + 0 + 120 + 330 = 712.\n   This remains < 985. Propose a closer trade allocation that sharpens from previous checks.\n   \n   Given the lack of better immediate responses:\n   \n   **Conclusion:** Walking away from negotiations ensures a better outcome given the external alternative.\n\n   {\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 6 for item 1, 29 for item 2, 69 for item 3, 43 for item 4, 57 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 884. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 356. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 356. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 612 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 29 x 1 + 69 x 1 + 43 x 2 + 57 x 3\n    which is 355 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 356. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, I'll proceed through the structured step-by-step analysis:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 356.\n   - My values for the items are: 6 (item 1), 29 (item 2), 69 (item 3), 43 (item 4), 57 (item 5).\n   - The total pool of items is: 4 (item 1), 3 (item 2), 5 (item 3), 2 (item 4), 6 (item 5).\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9, which affects the value of the negotiation in later rounds by reducing the effective value of the items.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - Current offer from Player 1: [0, 1, 2, 0, 1].\n     - My share from the current offer is: 4 (item 1), 2 (item 2), 3 (item 3), 2 (item 4), 5 (item 5).\n     - Calculating my total value for this offer:\n       - 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n       - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 29 = 58\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 69 = 207\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 43 = 86\n       - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 57 = 285\n     - Total value = 24 + 58 + 207 + 86 + 285 = 660\n   - My value for the current offer (660) is greater than my outside offer value (356).\n\n3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n   - The current offer gives me a considerably higher value (660) than my fallback outside offer (356).\n   - Accepting the current offer avoids the risk of a lower effective value in future rounds due to the discount factor.\n\nGiven that the current offer provides me with a value significantly higher than my outside offer, it makes sense to accept it.
