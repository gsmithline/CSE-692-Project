Since we're in round 1, the discount factor doesn't apply yet, so I would get 1061 by accepting this deal versus 963 by walking away.\n\nHowever, I should see if I can make a more advantageous counteroffer. Since item 1 has my highest value (61), I want to keep most of those.

Walk away and take my outside offer of 684\n2. Make a counteroffer that might be more favorable to me\n\nLet me try to create a better counteroffer. I need to keep items that are valuable to me while giving away enough value to make it attractive to Player 2.\n\nMy most valuable items are item 1 (96) and item 2 (74), followed by item 3 (59).

I should try to keep most of these while offering Player 1 the items I value less.\n\nThe most logical offer would be to keep:\n- Most or all of items 3 and 5 (high value to me)\n- Give up more of items 2 and 4 (low value to me)\n- Split item 1 (medium value)\n\nSo I'll offer Player 1:\n- 4 units of item 1 (keeping 3)\n- 3 units of item 2 (keeping 1)\n- 0 units of item 3 (keeping all 3)\n- 3 units of item 4 (keeping 1)\n- 1 unit of item 5 (keeping 5)\n\nThis way I'm keeping items with a total value of: \n3\u00d739 + 1\u00d715 + 3\u00d771 + 1\u00d716 + 5\u00d787 = 117 + 15 + 213 + 16 + 435 = 796\n\nWhile this is less than my outside offer, I'm hoping Player 1 will accept this or come back with a better counteroffer.
