If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the negotiation extends over rounds, the value is multiplied by \\(0.9^{(r-1)}\\). The value decreases with each additional round, so if I decide to wait, I need to ensure the offer becomes sufficiently better to compensate for the discount factor.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Current offer: None.\n   - Potential counteroffers:\n     - To construct a reasonable offer, I need to ensure the offer yields me a value higher than my outside offer of 369.\n     - For example, if I consider keeping most of the high-value items and keeping my value above 369:\n       - Let's try to offer [0, 0, 1, 1, 2] to Player 2, meaning I keep:\n         - 3 units of item 1 (3\u00d79 = 27)\n         - 2 units of item 2 (2\u00d717 = 34)\n         - 2 units of item 3 (2\u00d778 = 156)\n         - 2 units of item 4 (2\u00d743 = 86)\n         - 6 units of item 5 (6\u00d726 = 156)\n     - Total value to me: 27 + 34 + 156 + 86 + 156 = 459\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since there is no current offer on the table and accepting the hypothetical counteroffer provides a value (459) greater than my outside offer of 369, proposing this as my initial offer seems optimal.\n\nGiven this analysis, my action is to propose a counteroffer, as it is above my outside offer threshold and capitalizes on the negotiation potentials:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]}",

                    "response": "Let's walk through the steps systematically:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 814.\n  \n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 18 per unit, total 4 units\n  - Item 2: 7 per unit, total 3 units\n  - Item 3: 20 per unit, total 5 units\n  - Item 4: 58 per unit, total 3 units\n  - Item 5: 82 per unit, total 7 units\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**: \n  - There are 4 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 7 units of item 5. \n\n- **Discount Factor**: If the process concludes after r rounds, the value of the negotiation to each player is their value multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} \\). Here, the discount factor \\( \\gamma = 0.9 \\). Since it is round 1, the value of accepting an offer now would not be discounted, as moving to round 2 would multiply the value by \\( 0.9 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table for me to accept.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I should consider counteroffers that yield a value greater than my outside offer of 814. \n\n  Let's calculate my value for different proposed divisions I've initially set aside to maximize my return, and then decide what share to offer Player 2:\n\n  - Suppose I keep 2 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5, and offer the rest to Player 2:\n    - My value would be:\n      - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n      - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n      - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n      - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n      - 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 82 = 410\n    - Total value = 36 + 7 + 40 + 116 + 410 = 609, which is less than 814.\n\n  - Adjust the offer to achieve at least a value of 814. I should consider the full value.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince any counteroffer must be better than my outside offer:\n\n- Let's propose a counteroffer. For maximizing my return, I try to take values close to my outside offer:\n\n  To push the value closer to 814, I try the following split: keep 3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5:\n\n  - My value would be:\n    - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n    - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n    - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n    - 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 82 = 492\n  - Total value = 54 + 14 + 60 + 174 + 492 = 794, which is still less. \n\n  Keep 3 of item 5 and 1 unit of item 4 or check for adjustments:\n  - 3 units of item 5 give 246 + 58 for item 4 = 304\n  - Total current items = 44 + 14 + 40 = 98; so 402 from 814\n  \n  - Offer the other party [1, 1, 2, 1, 4]. \n  - Recalculate:\n  - Total = 360 + 14 (1 item 2) = 858 < 942 \n   \n\nFinally: Offer [1, 1, 2, 1, 4]\n\n### Conclusion\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 1, 4]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 687. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 576 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 5, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

We are in round 2, so any accepted offer needs to be adjusted by multiplying the value by \\(0.9^{1} = 0.9\\).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current offer value (for accepting):** I'm being offered [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], which means:\n\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 18 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 7 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 58 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n\n  Total value = 82\n\n  After applying the discount factor (0.9), the effective value = 82 \u00d7 0.9 = 73.8\n\n  My outside offer is 814, so accepting the current offer is not better than my outside offer.\n\n- **Evaluate potential counteroffers:**\n  - I need a counteroffer that provides me a value higher than my outside offer (814) when calculated without discounting, as walking away provides a guaranteed 814.\n  - I'll use a previous offer for reference. In round 1, I offered [1, 1, 2, 1, 4], and this gave me loads of value since I had more high-value items.\n\n  Let's compute the value I get if I keep [3, 2, 3, 2, 3] (offering the rest to Player 2):\n\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n\n  Total value = 54 + 14 + 60 + 116 + 246 = 490\n\n  According to my outside offer, this potential offer isn't sufficient. Let\u2019s try a higher value counter.\n\n  Compute value for keeping [3, 3, 3, 2, 2]:\n\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n  - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n\n  Total value = 54 + 21 + 60 + 116 + 164 = 415\n\n  We can continue iterating over such combinations until a viable one (e.g., value > 814) is found:\n\n  Keep [3, 2, 3, 3, 3] and offer [1, 1, 2, 0, 4] (closer to my last offer):\n\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n  - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246\n\n  Total value = 54 + 14 + 60 + 174 + 246 = 548  (Again, not large enough.)\n\n  Optimal offer involves more iteration (unlikely in one move).\n\n  If our best offers come up short, perhaps rethink another counteroffer:\n\n  Try to offer: [1, 1, 2, 2, 6] (giving more out, but not ideal player 2)\n\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n  - 1 units of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n  - 1 units of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 82 = 82\n\n  Given better value initially and trying new values is advisable.\n\n  **Optimal remain:** [2, 1, 3, 3, 7] (offset P2 Value, still under maximize)\n\n  - 1 Items = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n  - 1 Item 2 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - 3 Item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n  - 3 Item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n  - 1 Item 5 = 7 \u00d7 82 = 164\n\n  Total value = 36 + 7 + 60 + 174 + 574 (more work)\n\n  Framing personalized cost where choices suboptimize negotiation couldn't outperform estimate others first, optimise outcome increases guaranteed values yet discovery new potential balances implementation opportunity.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on Analysis:\n\nThe current offer on the table offers me far less value than my outside offer. My evaluation indicates no counteroffer (quick scenarios) was generating ideal results (higher > 814). It suggests moving closer by proposing an insightful balance, but due to detailed analysis, try improving marginal gain.\n\nMy optimal choice given constraints leads me to:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n\nThis ensures retaining 814, avoiding undue mistakes due to limited contractual alignment.",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 186. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 186. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 681 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 3, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 0 + 55 x 2 + 79 x 0 + 25 x 3 + 12 x 0\n    which is 185 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 186. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

This means if the negotiation goes beyond round 1, the effective value of any offer is reduced by 10% per round (technically, multiplied by 0.9 for each additional round). This incentivizes settling earlier rather than later unless we can make a significantly better deal in future rounds.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**: \n   - There is no current offer to evaluate from Player 2.\n\n2. **Potential Counteroffers**:\n   - My goal is to propose an offer that maximizes my item value while still being reasonable for the opposing party. I need to calculate potential offers to ensure that whatever I propose yields a value higher than 316 (my outside offer).\n\nLet's consider an offer where I take most or all the valuable items based on my valuation:\n\n#### Example Offer:\n- Keep: [0, 4, 1, 2, 2] (Give Player 2 the rest: [2, 2, 1, 2, 0])\n\n   - Value Calculation:\n     - Item 1: 0 unit \u00d7 34 = 0\n     - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 77 = 308\n     - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 1 = 1\n     - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 42 = 84\n     - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 38 = 76\n     - Total Value = 308 + 1 + 84 + 76 = 469\n\nSince 469 is greater than 316 (my outside offer), this offer seems favorable for me.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nBased on the analysis and calculations, I have determined a counteroffer that maximizes my value above my outside offer.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 0 + 77 x 2 + 1 x 1 + 42 x 2 + 38 x 2\n    which is 315 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 316. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 387. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 100 = 300 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1128 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    100 x 1 + 87 x 0 + 5 x 2 + 92 x 0 + 92 x 3\n    which is 386 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 387. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

The discount factor gamma = 0.9 means delaying to later rounds decreases the value, but currently, we are in round 1, so this is less of a concern.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince no offer is on the table for me to accept, I need to propose an offer that allows me to maximize my value:\n- My initial strategy is to ensure any counteroffer is above my outside offer value.\n\n#### Estimate Potential Counteroffers\nLet's start by considering a counteroffer, ensuring it provides more value than my outside offer:\n1. **First Proposal (Proposed Items to offer):**\n   - Offer Player 2 minimal items to maximize my value while still surpassing my outside offer.\n\n2. **Calculate Value if I keep:**\n   - Keep 2 units of Item 1: 2 \u00d7 100 = 200\n   - Keep 4 units of Item 2: 4 \u00d7 87 = 348\n   - Keep 2 units of Item 3: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n   - Keep 6 units of Item 4: 6 \u00d7 92 = 552\n   - Keep 2 units of Item 5: 2 \u00d7 92 = 184\n\n   Total Value for me = 200 + 348 + 10 + 552 + 184 = 1294\n\n   This offer allows me to hold items with a total value of 1294, which is well above my outside offer value of 387.\n\n3. **Formal Proposal:**\n   Offer Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 2, 1] (i.e., 0 units of Item 1, 1 unit of Item 2, 0 units of Item 3, 2 units of Item 4, and 1 unit of Item 5).\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- Since the value of what I keep with this proposal is much higher than my outside offer, it satisfies the condition to maximize my payoff and avoids the mistakes outlined.\n- My proposed counteroffer is better than the outside option and isn't worse than a hypothetical previous offer.\n\nHence, based on this analysis, the appropriate action is to make a **COUNTEROFFER**.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 1 + 48 x 1 + 42 x 2 + 25 x 2 + 62 x 3\n    which is 372 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 373. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

In the first round, this does not apply yet, as we're at the start of negotiation.\n\n### 2) Assessing the Value of Offers:\n\n- Since there is no current offer from Player 2, I need to consider potential offers I could make and ensure they are more valuable than my outside offer of 373.\n- Let's evaluate the scenario where I keep items with the highest value to maximize my return. I will attempt several potential splits and calculate their worth.\n\n#### Example of Keeping More Valuable Items:\n\n1. **Example Offer 1**:\n   - I keep: 6 units of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n   - Player 2 receives: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n   - My value:\n     - Item 1: 6 \u00d7 4 = 24\n     - Item 2: 0 \u00d7 48 = 0\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n     - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 25 = 125\n     - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 62 = 62\n     - Total: 337 (343 is less than the outside offer)\n\n2. **Adjusted Offer**:\n   - I keep: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 5 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5 \n   - Player 2 receives: [5, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n   - My value:\n     - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 4 = 4\n     - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n     - Item 3: 3 \u00d7 42 = 126\n     - Item 4: 5 \u00d7 25 = 125\n     - Item 5: 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n     - Total: 489\n\nThis adjusted offer gives me a total value of 489, which is greater than my outside offer of 373, and I can propose it.\n\n### 3) Making a Decision:\n\n- I should propose a counteroffer as attempting to claim my value possible over my outside offer.\n\nBased on the evaluation, I choose to propose the counteroffer that maximizes my own value:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 1, 0, 0, 0]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 2, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 1 + 48 x 1 + 42 x 2 + 25 x 2 + 62 x 3\n    which is 372 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 373. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [5, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 5, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 5, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Let's go through the analysis step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the current situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 373.\n   - Values of the items involved for me:\n     - Item 1: 4 per unit\n     - Item 2: 48 per unit\n     - Item 3: 42 per unit\n     - Item 4: 25 per unit\n     - Item 5: 62 per unit\n   - Total pool of items:\n     - 6 units of item 1\n     - 2 units of item 2\n     - 3 units of item 3\n     - 5 units of item 4\n     - 3 units of item 5\n   - The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) reduces the value of the outcome as time progresses.

In order to offer a counteroffer, this offer needs to increase. However, I only need to make my outside offer, as the opportunity to get more based on the discount factor won't incentivize me to wait and I should walk away.\n\n3) **Make a decision:**\n   - The current offer on the table gives me less value than my outside offer, even when applying the discount factor.\n   - Given the analysis above, I should walk away and take my outside offer as it provides more value guaranteed to me.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

In this game, if I need to wait until future rounds, the payoff has to be worth more to compensate for the delay, considering the discount factor.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n   - There is currently no offer on the table. I must make the first offer.\n   - Potential counteroffers (since it's round 1, I make the first offer):\n     - Calculate the value of several potential offers for both players and compare them to my outside offer.\n\nLet's construct an initial offer. I need to ensure that my share of the offered division results in value greater than my outside offer.\n\n- Suppose I keep:\n  - 5 units of item 1 (5 x 91 = 455)\n  - 3 units of item 2 (3 x 43 = 129)\n  - 2 units of item 3 (2 x 57 = 114)\n  - 2 units of item 4 (2 x 17 = 34)\n  - 4 units of item 5 (4 x 48 = 192)\n\nMy total value from keeping these would be 455 + 129 + 114 + 34 + 192 = 924. This is less than my outside option of 1139, which implies that I need to keep more or higher-valued items.\n\nLet's try another configuration:\n\n- Keep:\n  - 5 units of item 1 (5 x 91 = 455)\n  - 4 units of item 2 (4 x 43 = 172)\n  - 2 units of item 3 (2 x 57 = 114)\n  - 2 units of item 4 (2 x 17 = 34)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (3 x 48 = 144)\n\nThis gives me a value of 455 + 172 + 114 + 34 + 144 = 919, which is still less. Adjusting again:\n\n- Keep:\n  - 5 units of item 1 (5 x 91 = 455)\n  - 5 units of item 2 (5 x 43 = 215)\n  - 3 units of item 3 (3 x 57 = 171)\n  - 3 units of item 4 (3 x 17 = 51)\n  - 3 units of item 5 (3 x 48 = 144)\n\nTotal is 455 + 215 + 171 + 51 + 144 = 1036, still less than 1139.\n\nBy continuing this process, I must find a configuration where my share is equal to or exceeds my outside offer.\n\nUpon reaching such a division, I will propose this offer to Player 2.\n\nAfter trying out several combinations:\n\n4) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nBased on calculations, walking away could be safer than offering less than my ideal value, but exploration shows there's room to propose some division.\n\nTherefore, using my iterative attempts:\n\n- Keep:\n  - 4 units of item 1 (4 x 91 = 364)\n  - 6 units of item 2 (6 x 43 = 258)\n  - 3 units of item 3 (3 x 57 = 171)\n  - 3 units of item 4 (3 x 17 = 51)\n  - 2 units of item 5 (2 x 48 = 96)\n\nTotal is 364 + 258 + 171 + 51 + 96 = 940, yet again showing challenge to meet outside offer immediately.\n\nRe-assessing one more time to find better division, finding such optimal isn't apparent immediately, but aiming to not breach:\n\nUltimately, let's attempt with:\n\nCurrent iteration concludes,\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"} \n\nOtherwise seeking, reiterate offers until meeting conditions.",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 8, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 90 x 8 + 49 x 2 + 64 x 4\n    which is 1074 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1075. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Since it's round 2, accepting an offer in round 2 means calculating the value at a discount rate of \\( \\gamma^{1} \\) or \\( 0.9^1 = 0.9 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Value of Current Offer**: [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n  - 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 70 = 70\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 11 = 22\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n  - Total Value: 70 + 22 + 95 + 172 + 178 = 537\n  - Discounted Value: 537 \u00d7 0.9 = 483.3\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**: 483.3 (Discounted value of the current offer) < 1435 (Outside offer value)\n\n### Step 3: Decision Making\n\n1. **Accept the Current Offer**: The current offer gives 483.3 value, which is significantly less than my outside offer of 1435. Therefore, accepting is not beneficial.\n\n2. **Walk Away**: Comparatively, my outside offer remains more valuable than the current offer.\n\n3. **Propose a Counteroffer**: To avoid mistakes and propose a viable counteroffer, the value of what I keep must be greater than 1435.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 8, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    97 x 0 + 37 x 0 + 90 x 8 + 49 x 2 + 64 x 4\n    which is 1074 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1075. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 1, 2, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

So I will devise my own initial offer, making sure it adheres to the strategy of surpassing my outside offer value.\n\n#### Proposing a Counteroffer\n\nLet's start with a hypothetical division where I aim to keep a higher value than my outside offer:\n\n- **Example Division (to give to Player 2)**: [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n  - Keeping: [4, 3, 2, 1, 2]\n  - Calculating Value for the Units Kept:\n    - Item 1: 23 * 4 = 92\n    - Item 2: 84 * 3 = 252\n    - Item 3: 93 * 2 = 186\n    - Item 4: 26 * 1 = 26\n    - Item 5: 74 * 2 = 148\n  - **Total Value for Me**: 92 + 252 + 186 + 26 + 148 = 704\n\nThe total value I achieve with these divisions (704) is higher than my outside offer value (397), which makes this a reasonable initial offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven the calculated total value (704), which is significantly higher than my outside offer (397), I should propose this as my initial offer. It avoids all five negotiation mistakes outlined and positions me well to receive more than my outside alternative.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 834. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 729 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [6, 2, 2, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    67 x 6 + 36 x 2 + 7 x 2 + 54 x 2 + 79 x 3\n    which is 833 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 834. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 168. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 35 = 105 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 783 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    55 x 2 + 90 x 0 + 24 x 0 + 57 x 1 + 35 x 0\n    which is 167 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 168. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze the current situation and determine the best action. Let's follow the step-by-step approach.\n\n1) Current situation analysis:\n   - My outside offer value is 763\n   - My item values: item 1 = 28, item 2 = 57, item 3 = 88, item 4 = 18, item 5 = 31\n   - Total pool: 9 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 4 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n   - Discount factor gamma = 0.9, which means each round reduces value by 10%\n\n2) Value assessment:\n   - Current offer to me: [4, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n   - This means I would get: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5\n   - And Player 1 would get: 5 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5\n   \n   Let me calculate the value of this offer to me:\n   4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n   1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 57 = 57\n   1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 88 = 88\n   2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n   1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 31 = 31\n   Total value = 324\n\n   This is much less than my outside offer of 763, so I should not accept this offer.\n\n3) Decision making:\n   I need to make a counteroffer that gives me a value at least equal to my outside offer.\n   \n   Let me try to keep most high-value items:\n   - My highest value item is item 3 (88 per unit), so I should keep both units\n   - My second highest value item is item 2 (57 per unit), so I should keep most/all units\n   - Item 5 (31 per unit) and item 1 (28 per unit) are moderately valuable\n   - Item 4 (18 per unit) is my least valuable, can offer more of these\n\n   Let me try this allocation (what I keep):\n   8 units of item 1 = 8 \u00d7 28 = 224\n   3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n   2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n   2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n   3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n   Total value = 700\n\n   This is less than my outside offer of 763. Let me adjust further.\n\n   How about (what I keep):\n   9 units of item 1 = 9 \u00d7 28 = 252\n   3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n   2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n   2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 36\n   3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n   Total value = 728\n\n   Still less than 763. Let me try one more adjustment:\n\n   9 units of item 1 = 9 \u00d7 28 = 252\n   3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n   2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n   3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n   3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n   Total value = 746\n\n   This is still less than my outside offer of 763. I need to keep all 4 units of item 4 as well:\n\n   9 units of item 1 = 9 \u00d7 28 = 252\n   3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n   2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n   4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 18 = 72\n   3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n   Total value = 764\n\n   This value (764) exceeds my outside offer (763), so this is acceptable.\n\n   My counteroffer to Player 1 would be: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n   \n   However, offering nothing is a poor negotiation strategy (Mistake 3). Let me reconsider.\n\n   Since my outside offer is so high (763) and the total value of all items to me is only 764, I need to be strategic. Player 1 might value some items much higher than I do.\n\n   Let me offer Player 1 some of my lowest-value items:\n   - I'll offer 1 unit of item 4 (my lowest value item)\n   \n   This would give me:\n   9 units of item 1 = 9 \u00d7 28 = 252\n   3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171\n   2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n   3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n   3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 31 = 93\n   Total value = 746\n\n   This is still less than my outside offer.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    13 x 1 + 76 x 3 + 19 x 0 + 79 x 0 + 23 x 0\n    which is 241 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 243. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This suggests they may not value these items as highly.\n- They're keeping all of item 1, suggesting they might value it highly, while I value it at only 18 per unit.\n- They're keeping most of item 5, which I value highly at 53 per unit.\n\n## 4) Decision Making:\nWhile the current offer (261) exceeds my outside offer (199), I should consider making a counteroffer to potentially increase my value further.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 8, 3, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 79 x 8 + 45 x 3 + 13 x 3 + 89 x 1\n    which is 895 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 896.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 896. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 13 = 39 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 89 = 267 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 939 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 8, 3, 3, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 79 x 8 + 45 x 3 + 13 x 3 + 89 x 1\n    which is 895 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 896. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 3, 4, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 8, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 3, 0, 1, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 7, 0, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 7, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Given this is the last round, Player 2 cannot make a counteroffer; they can only accept or walk.\n\nLet's ensure a counteroffer that maximizes remaining values:\n1. Keeping items with higher per unit value:\n   - items 1, 2 and 5 are high-value items.\n2. Making an offer: [3, 8, 3, 4, 3]. This means I get [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]:\n   - 2 of item 1: \\( 2 \\times 87 = 174 \\)\n   - 1 of item 2: \\( 1 \\times 79 = 79 \\)\n   - 0 of item 3: \\( 0 \\times 45 = 0 \\)\n   - 0 of item 4: \\( 0 \\times 13 = 0 \\)\n   - 0 of item 5: \\( 0 \\times 89 = 0 \\)\n- **Total Value:** \\( 174 + 79 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 253 \\)\n- **Discounted Value in Round 3:** \\( 253 \\times 0.81 = \\approx 204.93 \\) which is less than $896.\n\nSince any profitable value for me neglected to ensure less cost for Player 2, thus my final preferred offer is to:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 458. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 458. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 76 = 228 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 642 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 76 x 1 + 36 x 0 + 80 x 3 + 20 x 7\n    which is 456 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 458. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 76 x 1 + 36 x 0 + 80 x 3 + 20 x 7\n    which is 456 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 458. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 1, 1, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 1, 0, 4]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

Since we are in round 3, if the negotiation concludes this round, the offered value will be unaffected by a further discount (as it's the final opportunity). However, the potential value of waiting is irrelevant as there's no round to wait for.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current Offer**: [2, 2, 0, 2, 3]\n  - Value to me:\n    - Item 1: 3 units = 3 x 2 = 6\n    - Item 2: 2 units = 2 x 76 = 152\n    - Item 3: 4 units = 4 x 36 = 144\n    - Item 4: 1 unit = 1 x 80 = 80\n    - Item 5: 5 units = 5 x 20 = 100\n\n  Total value = 6 + 152 + 0 + 160 + 60 = 378\n\n- The current offer value to me (378) is less than my outside offer value (458).\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- **Accept** the current offer: This would yield a value of 378, which is less than my outside offer value of 458, leading to Mistake 4, which is unacceptable.\n- **WALK**: This guarantees me a value of 458 from my outside offer, which is higher than the value of the current offer.\n- **COUNTEROFFER**: Since this is the final round, if I make a counteroffer, it would be treated as a walk if Player 2 does not accept.\n\nGiven that accepting the current offer would result in a value less than my outside offer and a counteroffer may be a gamble without potential for future negotiations, the best course of action would be to WALK.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation systematically to make the best decision.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 606\n- My item values: \n  * Item 1: 79 per unit (2 total units)\n  * Item 2: 30 per unit (2 total units)\n  * Item 3: 50 per unit (2 total units)\n  * Item 4: 28 per unit (5 total units)\n  * Item 5: 58 per unit (7 total units)\n- Total pool: [2, 2, 2, 5, 7]\n- Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.9 per round\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of Player 1's offer\n\nPlayer 1 offered me [0, 0, 0, 4, 7], keeping [2, 2, 2, 1, 0] for themselves.\n\nMy value if I accept this offer:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 79 = 0\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n- 0 units of item 3: 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n- 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 28 = 112\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 58 = 406\n- Total value: 518\n\nSince this is round 1, there's no discount factor applied yet.\n\n518 < 606 (my outside offer), so accepting this offer would be worse than my outside option.\n\n### Step 3: Consider potential counteroffers\n\nI should create a counteroffer that gives me more than my outside offer value while still being potentially attractive to Player 1.\n\nLooking at Player 1's offer, they seem to value items 1, 2, and 3 highly (kept all of them), while valuing items 4 and 5 less (offered most/all to me).\n\nMy highest-value items are items 1 and 5. Let me try to keep most of these and offer some of the other items.\n\nLet me try offering Player 1 [0, 2, 1, 4, 2], keeping [2, 0, 1, 1, 5] for myself:\n\nMy value with this allocation:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 58 = 290\n- Total value: 526\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer (606).\n\nLet me try offering Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 4, 2], keeping [2, 0, 2, 1, 5] for myself:\n\nMy value with this allocation:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 28 = 28\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 58 = 290\n- Total value: 576\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer (606).\n\nLet me try offering Player 1 [0, 2, 0, 3, 2], keeping [2, 0, 2, 2, 5] for myself:\n\nMy value with this allocation:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n- 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 30 = 0\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 58 = 290\n- Total value: 604\n\nThis is still slightly less than my outside offer (606).\n\nLet me try offering Player 1 [0, 1, 0, 3, 2], keeping [2, 1, 2, 2, 5] for myself:\n\nMy value with this allocation:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 30 = 30\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 50 = 100\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 28 = 56\n- 5 units of item 5: 5 \u00d7 58 = 290\n- Total value: 634\n\nThis is now greater than my outside offer (606).\n\n### Step 4: Make a decision\n\nFrom my analysis:\n1. Player 1's offer gives me a value of 518, which is less than my outside offer of 606.\n2. My counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 3, 2] gives me a value of 634, which exceeds my outside offer.\n\nThe counteroffer I've calculated gives me more value than my outside offer while aligning with what appears to be Player 1's preferences (they seem to value items 1 and 3 highly).\n\nI will make a counteroffer of [0, 1, 0, 3, 2] to Player 1.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 3, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 334. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 54 = 162 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 936 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 1, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 65 x 1 + 82 x 1 + 24 x 1 + 54 x 3\n    which is 333 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 334. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 7]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 0, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 404. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 777 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 39 x 5 + 8 x 0 + 52 x 4\n    which is 403 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 404. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's proceed step by step:\n\n1) **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - **Outside offer value:** 404\n   - **Values of the items involved:**\n     - Item 1: 96\n     - Item 2: 64\n     - Item 3: 39\n     - Item 4: 8\n     - Item 5: 52\n   - **Total pool of items:**\n     - Item 1: 0 units\n     - Item 2: 0 units\n     - Item 3: 6 units\n     - Item 4: 2 units\n     - Item 5: 5 units\n\n   - **Discount factor:** The discount factor, gamma = 0.9, reduces the value of future offers compared to immediate outcomes. Each round's value is multiplied by gamma^(r-1).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer, we'll consider what counteroffers we can propose:\n   - Calculate the maximum possible value if I keep all items:\n     - Item 1: 0 units x 96 = 0\n     - Item 2: 0 units x 64 = 0\n     - Item 3: 6 units x 39 = 234\n     - Item 4: 2 units x 8 = 16\n     - Item 5: 5 units x 52 = 260\n   - Total possible value = 0 + 0 + 234 + 16 + 260 = 510\n\n   - I need to propose a division where my value is higher than my outside offer of 404.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n   - Here are a few possible distributions to consider as offers:\n     - If I propose keeping [0, 0, 4, 1, 3] units for myself, my value would be:\n       - Item 3: 4 units x 39 = 156\n       - Item 4: 1 unit x 8 = 8\n       - Item 5: 3 units x 52 = 156\n     - Total value = 156 + 8 + 156 = 320\n\n     - Another option is to keep [0, 0, 5, 1, 2] units for myself:\n       - Item 3: 5 units x 39 = 195\n       - Item 4: 1 unit x 8 = 8\n       - Item 5: 2 units x 52 = 104\n     - Total value = 195 + 8 + 104 = 307\n\n     - Finally, let's consider keeping [0, 0, 6, 0, 2] units for myself:\n       - Item 3: 6 units x 39 = 234\n       - Item 4: 0 units x 8 = 0\n       - Item 5: 2 units x 52 = 104\n     - Total value = 234 + 0 + 104 = 338\n\n   - I need to offer a more equitable division so that my value exceeds my outside offer of 404. Therefore, keeping more units aligns better with my goal.\n\nAfter evaluating these considerations and given that my breakdown does not yet exceed my fallback of 404, I should aim to maximize my retention of higher-value items. A rational approach would involve conceding fewer high-value items and keeping higher values for myself. I will therefore offer a minimal counteroffer while maximizing my value retention.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:** As I have no standing offer, I will propose a counteroffer where I retain more high-value items.\n\nKeeping [0, 0, 5, 2, 4] (offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] ) ensures that we check all constraints:\n\n   - Item 3: 5 units x 39 = 195\n   - Item 4: 2 units x 8 = 16\n   - Item 5: 4 units x 52 = 208\n   - Total value = 195 + 16 + 208 = 419, which exceeds 404\n   \nSince the value of self-retention here equals 419, I am beyond 404, my safeguard threshold. \n\nThus, my action is: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 5, 0, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 64 x 0 + 39 x 5 + 8 x 0 + 52 x 4\n    which is 403 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 404. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 1, 0, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

The current offer is significantly less valuable than my outside offer.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n   - I should not accept the current offer as its value (175.5) is much less than my outside offer (404).\n   - Walking away would secure me a value of 404, which is better than the current offer.\n   - My original offer was [0, 0, 1, 0, 1], which was a balanced offer, given that it was better than the current offer in terms of value. \n   - Offering something like [0, 0, 3, 0, 1] would give me more value as it would allow me to hold onto more of item 3, which is valuable. The value calculation:\n     - 0 units of item 1 = 0\n     - 0 units of item 2 = 0\n     - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n     - 0 units of item 4 = 0\n     - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n     - Total value = 117 + 52 = 169\n\n   However, 169 is still less than 404. Therefore, this isn't a good counteroffer.\n\nSince there is no combination of counteroffer units that gives me a value exceeding 404, the optimal choice is to WALK.

The discount factor starts influencing if the negotiation goes to subsequent rounds (round 2 or beyond).\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose an initial offer. I will calculate the value of different distributions and compare them to my outside offer.\n\n  Let's try proposing a counteroffer where I retain a significant portion of the high-value items (like item 2 and item 5) to ensure my value is above my outside offer.\n\n  Suppose I propose to keep for myself [3 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 1 unit of item 5]:\n  - Value from item 1: 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n  - Value from item 2: 2 \u00d7 75 = 150\n  - Value from item 3: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n  - Value from item 4: 1 \u00d7 58 = 58\n  - Value from item 5: 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n  - Total Value = 42 + 150 + 23 + 58 + 95 = 368\n\nThis total value of 368 is well below my outside offer of 827. Therefore, I need to adjust to keep more items.\n\nLet's try a more favorable proportion to keep for myself. Suppose I decide to keep:\n- [5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5]:\n  - Value from item 1: 5 x 14 = 70\n  - Value from item 2: 7 x 75 = 525\n  - Value from item 3: 3 x 23 = 69\n  - Value from item 4: 2 x 58 = 116\n  - Value from item 5: 1 x 95 = 95\n  - Total Value = 70 + 525 + 69 + 116 + 95 = 875\n\nThis configuration gives me a value of 875, which is above my outside offer value of 827.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nSince I have found a proposed counteroffer with a total value greater than my outside offer, I will make that counteroffer:\n  - I keep: [5 units of item 1, 7 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 1 unit of item 5]\n  - I give Player 2: [0 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 1 unit of item 4, 2 units of item 5]\n\nTherefore, my action is to propose a counteroffer.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 2, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 827. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 75 = 225 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 95 = 285 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 795 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 7, 3, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    14 x 3 + 75 x 7 + 23 x 3 + 58 x 0 + 95 x 2\n    which is 826 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 827. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 4, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Therefore, compare the discounted value of offers to the outside offer.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer ([3, 4, 1, 2, 1]) total value:**\n  - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n  - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 75 = 300\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n  - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 95 = 95\n  - Total value = 42 + 300 + 23 + 116 + 95 = 576\n  - Discounted value = 576 \u00d7 0.9 = 518.4\n\nSince 518.4 is less than my outside offer value of 827, I should not accept this offer.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers:**\n  Let's find a division that gives me a total value greater than 827, discounted to meet or exceed this value for round 2.\n\nFor example:\n- If I keep [3, 5, 2, 1, 0]:\n\n  - Value: (3 \u00d7 14) + (5 \u00d7 75) + (2 \u00d7 23) + (1 \u00d7 58) + (0 \u00d7 95)\n  - Value: 42 + 375 + 46 + 58 + 0 = 521\n  - Discounted value for round 2 = 521 \u00d7 0.9 = 468.9\n\nThis is still not meeting or exceeding the outside offer's value and represents a walk action due to failure in comparison to the original target. Let\u2019s adjust the potential counteroffer to increase this value appropriately.\n\nLet's try to propose a value that is getting closer:\n- Possible offer:\n  - I keep [4, 5, 2, 0, 0]:\n\n  - Value: (4 \u00d7 14) + (5 \u00d7 75) + (2 \u00d7 23) + (0 \u00d7 58) + (0 \u00d7 95)\n  - Value: 56 + 375 + 46 + 0 + 0 = 477\n  - Discounted value for round 2 = 477 \u00d7 0.9 = 429.3\n  \n  Still does not reach the outside value.\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\n\nGiven all considered, the analysis concludes that neither currently presented offers nor initially tested counteroffers provide a value superior to 827 when adjusted for potential rounds.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 209. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 91 = 273 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 82 = 246 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1263 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    91 x 2 + 88 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 72 x 0\n    which is 182 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 209. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 4, 2, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 4, 2, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

This is a good offer for me.\n\nHowever, I can see that Player 1 wants all of items 1 and 2, suggesting they highly value these items. Since this is only round 1, I should consider making a counteroffer that improves my position while still being acceptable to Player 1.\n\n## 4) Considering a Counteroffer:\nLet me try a counteroffer where I keep some of the valuable items 1 and 2, while giving Player 1 more of the items they seem to want:\n\nIf I offer Player 1 [3, 4, 0, 0, 2], I would keep:\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 91 = 182\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 88 = 176\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 88 = 352\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 82 = 164\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 72 = 216\nTotal value to me: 1090\n\nThis counteroffer would give me more value than the current offer (1090 > 876), and it's well above my outside offer of 209.\n\nI'm giving Player 1 most of items 1 and 2 which they seem to value, but keeping some for myself. I'm offering some of item 5 which they included in their initial offer to me, suggesting they don't value it as highly.\n\nThis seems like a fair counteroffer that improves my position while respecting Player 1's apparent preferences.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 4, 0, 0, 2]}",

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 519. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 1, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 5 + 17 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 85 x 0 + 92 x 3\n    which is 518 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 519. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 3, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 3, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 0, 1, 0, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    48 x 5 + 17 x 0 + 2 x 1 + 85 x 0 + 92 x 3\n    which is 518 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 519. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This motivates securing a good deal sooner rather than delaying unnecessarily.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer on the table, we can suggest a first offer for Player 2.\n   - We need to find a division such that the sum of the value of the items I keep is higher than my outside offer of 93.\n   - I should also ensure my offer is reasonable so there can be chances Player 2 accepts it. Therefore, I try to balance keeping items that are more valuable to me and offering items considering Player 2 might find those valuable too. However, I lack information about Player 2's valuations, so my goal is first to exceed my outside value without unreasonable extremes.\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - I need to propose an initial offer. Let's calculate the value I receive by trying some divisions.\n\nLet's construct an offer:\n- Offer 3 units of item 1 (keep 2 for me, value: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12)\n- Offer 0 units of item 2 (keeping 1 for me, value: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97)\n- Offer 0 units of item 3 (keeping 1 for me, value: 1 \u00d7 59 = 59)\n- Offer 7 units of item 4 (keeping 3 for me, value: 3 \u00d7 27 = 81)\n- Offer 1 units of item 5 (keeping 3 for me, value: 3 \u00d7 78 = 234)\n\nCalculating the total value I receive:\n- Total value = 12 + 97 + 59 + 81 + 234 = 483\n\nThe value I receive (483) significantly exceeds my outside offer of 93.

Let me adjust:\n   \n   If I keep [3, 1, 1, 4, 3] and offer [2, 0, 0, 6, 1]:\n   My value = (3 \u00d7 75) + (1 \u00d7 5) + (1 \u00d7 33) + (4 \u00d7 40) + (3 \u00d7 86) = 225 + 5 + 33 + 160 + 258 = 681\n   \n   Still below my outside offer. Let's try again:\n   \n   If I keep [3, 1, 1, 5, 3] and offer [2, 0, 0, 5, 1]:\n   My value = (3 \u00d7 75) + (1 \u00d7 5) + (1 \u00d7 33) + (5 \u00d7 40) + (3 \u00d7 86) = 225 + 5 + 33 + 200 + 258 = 721\n   \n   Still below 725. One more adjustment:\n   \n   If I keep [3, 1, 1, 6, 3] and offer [2, 0, 0, 4, 1]:\n   My value = (3 \u00d7 75) + (1 \u00d7 5) + (1 \u00d7 33) + (6 \u00d7 40) + (3 \u00d7 86) = 225 + 5 + 33 + 240 + 258 = 761\n   \n   This is above my outside offer of 725, so this would be a reasonable counteroffer.\n\nBased on this analysis, I should propose a counteroffer where I offer [2, 0, 0, 4, 1] to Player 1, keeping the rest for myself.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 93. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 59 = 177 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 78 = 234 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 801 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 1, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 1 + 97 x 0 + 59 x 1 + 27 x 1 + 78 x 0\n    which is 92 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 93. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Therefore, let's keep all of the most valuable items. \n\n  **Improved Offer:**\n  - Keep all 6 units of item 1 \u2192 6 \u00d7 95 = 570\n  - Keep all units of item 2 \u2192 3 \u00d7 34 = 102\n  - Keep all units of item 3 \u2192 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n  - Keep all units of item 4 \u2192 8 \u00d7 17 = 136\n  - Have to offer 1 unit of item 5, so keep 4 \u2192 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n\n  Total value for me: 570 + 102 + 42 + 136 + 80 = 930\n\n  This distribution value is greater than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that my computation gave a total of 930 which is above my outside offer of 863, I should consider offering only as many items to the opponent as it still prompts them to negotiate or counter but strictly remains above my outside offer.\n\n**Initial Counteroffer:** I will keep almost all items to stay above the outside offer, but offer a softer initial proposal favorably received by the other player to ensure they counter and engage.\n\n**Proposed Counteroffer:**  \n- Offer [0, 0, 0, 4, 0] to Player 2 (offering units from item 4).\n\n**Final Action:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]}\n```\n\nThis retains my highest interests and strategic opening by offering some of the less valued quantity of item 4 to potentially engage Player 2 in negotiation.",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 395. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 789 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 6, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    56 x 0 + 88 x 0 + 61 x 2 + 20 x 6 + 38 x 4\n    which is 394 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 395. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "I need to analyze this negotiation step by step to make an optimal decision.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis\n- My outside offer value: 395\n- My values per unit: item 1 = 56, item 2 = 88, item 3 = 61, item 4 = 20, item 5 = 38\n- Total pool: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: 0.9 (each round reduces value by 10%)\n- Current round: 1 (no discount applied yet)\n\n## 2) Assess the Current Offer\nPlayer 1 has offered me [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], which means:\n- I would get 4 units of item 4\n- Player 1 would keep all other items\n\nValue to me of the current offer:\n- 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n- Total value = 80\n\nThis is significantly less than my outside offer of 395, so I should not accept.\n\n## 3) Consider Potential Counteroffers\nI should formulate a counteroffer that:\n- Gives me a value well above my outside offer of 395\n- Is potentially acceptable to Player 1\n\nLooking at my values, items 1, 2, and 3 are most valuable to me. Let's try keeping most of these high-value items.\n\nLet me try keeping:\n- 5 units of item 1 (leaving 1 for Player 1)\n- 3 units of item 2 (keeping all)\n- 5 units of item 3 (leaving 1 for Player 1)\n- 4 units of item 4 (leaving 4 for Player 1)\n- 2 units of item 5 (leaving 3 for Player 1)\n\nThis would give me:\n- 5 \u00d7 56 = 280 (item 1)\n- 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (item 2)\n- 5 \u00d7 61 = 305 (item 3)\n- 4 \u00d7 20 = 80 (item 4)\n- 2 \u00d7 38 = 76 (item 5)\n- Total value = 1005\n\nSo my counteroffer to Player 1 would be [1, 0, 1, 4, 3]\n\nThis would give me a value of 1005, which is much better than my outside offer of 395.\n\n## 4) Evaluate the Risks\nGiven that Player 1 offered me only 4 units of item 4, they might value the other items highly. My counteroffer needs to be reasonable to avoid them walking away.\n\nBased on their initial offer, Player 1 seems willing to give up some of item 4. I'm offering them more units of items 1, 3, and 5, which may be attractive to them.\n\n## Decision:\nI will make a counteroffer of [1, 0, 1, 4, 3], which means I would give Player 1:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 4 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis gives me a value of 1005, well above my outside offer of 395.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 1, 4, 3]}",

You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n1) Current situation:\n   - My outside offer value is 395\n   - My item values: Item 1: 56, Item 2: 88, Item 3: 61, Item 4: 20, Item 5: 38\n   - Total pool: 6 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 6 units of item 3, 8 units of item 4, 5 units of item 5\n   - We're in round 2, so the discount factor is 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9\n\n2) Value assessment:\n   - Current offer gives me: [6, 3, 4, 4, 4]\n   - Value calculation: \n     * 6 \u00d7 56 = 336 (item 1)\n     * 3 \u00d7 88 = 264 (item 2)\n     * 4 \u00d7 61 = 244 (item 3)\n     * 4 \u00d7 20 = 80 (item 4)\n     * 4 \u00d7 38 = 152 (item 5)\n     * Total: 1076\n   - With discount factor: 1076 \u00d7 0.9 = 968.4\n   - This is far better than my outside offer of 395\n\n3) Decision analysis:\n   - Player 1's offers suggest they value items 3, 4, and 5 more than items 1 and 2\n   - My last offer gave them [1, 0, 1, 4, 3], and they countered with [6, 3, 4, 4, 4] for me\n   - I notice Player 1 is willing to give me all of items 1 and 2, suggesting they value these less\n   - The offer on the table is already very good for me (968.4 vs. outside offer of 395)\n\nSince the current offer gives me a value of 968.4, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 395, I should accept this offer. It appears Player 1 values different items than I do, creating a win-win opportunity.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",
